STRUCTURED TRANSACTION MARKETPLACES HISTORICALLY AIGS TRIPLE A RATINGS PROVIDED AIGFP A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THE DOWNGRADES HAVE REDUCED THIS ADVANTAGE AND FOR SPECIALIZED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT GENERALLY ARE CONDUCTED ONLY BY TRIPLE A RATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COUNTERPARTIES MAY BE UNWILLING TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH AIGFP EXCEPT ON A SECURED BASIS THIS COULD REQUIRE AIGFP TO POST MORE COLLATERAL TO COUNTERPARTIES IN THE FUTURE SEE BELOW FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT THAT POSTING COLLATERAL MAY HAVE ON AIGS LIQUIDITY ALTHOUGH THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH RATINGS OF AIGS INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES REMAIN HIGH COMPARED TO MANY OF THEIR COMPETITORS THE DOWNGRADES HAVE REDUCED THE PREVIOUS RATINGS DIFFERENTIAL THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF THE RATINGS TO AIGS INSURANCE COMPANY

MUNICIPAL GUARANTEED INVESTMENT CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS IN THE EVENT OF A FURTHER DOWNGRADE AIG WILL BE REQUIRED TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL IT IS ESTIMATED THAT AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 28 2006 BASED ON AIGS OUTSTANDING MUNICIPAL GUARANTEED INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS AND FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS AS OF SUCH DATE A FURTHER DOWNGRADE OF AIGS LONG TERM SENIOR DEBT RATINGS TO AA3 BY MOODYS OR AA BY S and P WOULD PERMIT COUNTERPARTIES TO CALL FOR APPROXIMATELY 962 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL FURTHER ADDITIONAL DOWNGRADES COULD RESULT IN REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON HOW AIG MANAGES ITS LIQUIDITY THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL THAT AIG WOULD BE REQUIRED TO POST TO COUNTERPARTIES IN THE EVENT OF SUCH DOWNGRADES DEPENDS ON MARKET CONDITIONS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE OUTSTANDING AFFECTED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF THE DOWNGRADE ANY ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS TO POST COLLATERAL WILL INCREASE THE DEMAND ON AIGS LIQUIDITY REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AIGS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2005
