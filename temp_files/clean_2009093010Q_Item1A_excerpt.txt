ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS THE FOLLOWING SUPPLEMENTS THE RISK FACTORS SET FORTH IN ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS OF PART I OF THE 2008 FORM 10 K AND IN ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS OF PART II OF AIG S QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10 Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30 2009 AND MARCH 31 2009 A DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT MARKETS MAY CAUSE AIG TO RECOGNIZE UNREALIZED MARKET VALUATION LOSSES IN AIGFP S REGULATORY CAPITAL SUPER SENIOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP PORTFOLIO IN FUTURE PERIODS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON AIG S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MOREOVER DEPENDING ON HOW THE EXTENSION OF THE BASEL I CAPITAL FLOORS IS IMPLEMENTED THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT AIGFP REMAINS AT RISK FOR SUCH DETERIORATION COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED BY AIGFP A TOTAL OF 171 7 BILLION IN NET NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SUPER SENIOR CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP CDS PORTFOLIO OF AIGFP AS OF SEPTEMBER 30 2009 REPRESENTED DERIVATIVES WRITTEN FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRINCIPALLY IN EUROPE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING REGULATORY CAPITAL RELIEF RATHER THAN FOR ARBITRAGE PURPOSES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE LIABILITY FOR THESE CDS TRANSACTIONS WAS 31MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30 2009 THE REGULATORY BENEFIT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR AIGFP S FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY DERIVED FROM THE TERMS OF BASEL I THAT EXISTED THROUGH THE END OF 2007 AND WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING REPLACED BY BASEL II IT IS EXPECTED THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES WILL HAVE TRANSITIONED FROM BASEL I TO BASEL II BY THE END OF THE TWO YEAR ADOPTION PERIOD ON DECEMBER 31 2009 AFTER WHICH THEY WILL RECEIVE LITTLE OR NO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY BENEFIT FROM THESE CDS TRANSACTIONS EXCEPT IN A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIFIC INSTANCES AND THEREFORE AIGFP EXPECTS THAT THE COUNTERPARTIES WILL TERMINATE THE MAJORITY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS HOWEVER THE BASEL COMMITTEE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS AGREED TO KEEP IN PLACE THE BASEL I CAPITAL FLOORS BEYOND THE END OF 2009 ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW THIS EXTENSION WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE VARIOUS EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKING DISTRICTS SHOULD CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES CONTINUE TO RECEIVE FAVORABLE REGULATORY CAPITAL BENEFITS FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS THOSE COUNTERPARTIES MAY NOT EXERCISE THEIR OPTIONS TO TERMINATE THE TRANSACTIONS IN THE EXPECTED TIME FRAME THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED OR OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO AIGFP REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE AND CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS IN EACH REGULATORY CAPITAL CDS TRANSACTION IS NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL TRANSACTIONS FURTHERMORE IN A MAJORITY OF CORPORATE LOAN TRANSACTIONS AND ALL OF THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE TRANSACTIONS THE POOLS ARE BLIND MEANING THAT THE IDENTITIES OF OBLIGORS ARE NOT DISCLOSED TO AIGFP IN ADDITION ALTHOUGH AIGFP RECEIVES PERIODIC REPORTS ON THE UNDERLYING ASSET POOLS VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE REGULATORY CAPITAL CDS TRANSACTIONS CONTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RESTRICTIONS THAT PRECLUDE AIGFP S PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING REFERENCED ASSETS AIGFP ANALYZES THE INFORMATION REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE AND CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING POOLS OF ASSETS REQUIRED TO MAKE ITS OWN RISK ASSESSMENT AND TO DETERMINE ANY CHANGES IN CREDIT QUALITY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH POOLS OF ASSETS WHILE MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION RECEIVED BY AIGFP CANNOT BE AGGREGATED IN A COMPARABLE WAY FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES BECAUSE OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY RESTRICTIONS AND THE INCONSISTENCY OF THE INFORMATION IT DOES PROVIDE A SUFFICIENT BASIS FOR AIGFP TO EVALUATE THE RISKS OF THE PORTFOLIO AND TO DETERMINE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE GIVEN THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIOS THE LEVEL OF SUBORDINATION AND AIGFP S OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO AS WELL AS THE RISK MITIGANTS INHERENT IN THE TRANSACTION STRUCTURES AIGFP DOES NOT EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDING REGULATORY CAPITAL RELIEF FURTHER AIGFP EXPECTS THAT COUNTERPARTIES WILL TERMINATE THESE TRANSACTIONS PRIOR TO THEIR MATURITY AIGFP WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE VALUATION OF THIS PORTFOLIO AND MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MARKETPLACE GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT MARKETS THERE 198 TABLE OF CONTENTS AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC AND SUBSIDIARIES CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT AIG WILL NOT RECOGNIZE UNREALIZED MARKET VALUATION LOSSES FROM THIS PORTFOLIO IN FUTURE PERIODS DEPENDING ON HOW THE EXTENSION OF THE BASEL I CAPITAL FLOORS IS IMPLEMENTED AIG COULD ALSO REMAIN AT RISK FOR A SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAN ANTICIPATED MOREOVER GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE CREDIT EXPOSURE A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS PORTFOLIO COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON AIG S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION THE LIMITATIONS ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONTAINED IN THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 AND THE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON COMPENSATION BY THE SPECIAL MASTER FOR TARP EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT AIG S ABILITY TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE ITS HIGHEST PERFORMING EMPLOYEES ON FEBRUARY 17 2009 THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 RECOVERY ACT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW THE RECOVERY ACT CONTAINS RESTRICTIONS ON BONUS AND OTHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAYABLE TO THE FIVE EXECUTIVES NAMED IN A COMPANY S PROXY STATEMENT AND THE NEXT TWENTY HIGHEST PAID EMPLOYEES OF COMPANIES RECEIVING TARP FUNDS PURSUANT TO THE RECOVERY ACT THE OFFICE OF THE SPECIAL MASTER FOR TARP EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION SPECIAL MASTER ISSUED AN INITIAL DETERMINATION MEMORANDUM ON OCTOBER 22 2009 WITH RESPECT TO AIG S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS EXCEPT FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND TWENTY HIGHEST PAID EMPLOYEES ALTHOUGH THE DETERMINATION MEMORANDUM IS NOT YET FINAL IT APPEARS LIKELY TO SET SIGNIFICANT NEW RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPENSATION OF THESE EMPLOYEES HISTORICALLY AIG HAS EMBRACED A PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PHILOSOPHY DEPENDING UPON THE LIMITATIONS PLACED ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION BY THE FINAL DETERMINATION MEMORANDUM ISSUED BY THE SPECIAL MASTER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AIG MAY BE UNABLE TO CREATE A COMPENSATION STRUCTURE THAT PERMITS AIG TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE ITS HIGHEST PERFORMING EMPLOYEES THE SPECIAL MASTER IS ALSO REVIEWING AIG S COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR ITS NEXT 75 MOST HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES DEPENDING ON THE ACTIONS OF THE SPECIAL MASTER AIG S ABILITY TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE THESE EMPLOYEES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS WELL AN INABILITY OF AIG TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE ITS HIGHEST PERFORMING EMPLOYEES MAY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO STABILIZE ITS BUSINESSES EXECUTE ON ITS ASSET DISPOSITION PLAN AND PREPARE AND MAKE REQUIRED FILINGS
