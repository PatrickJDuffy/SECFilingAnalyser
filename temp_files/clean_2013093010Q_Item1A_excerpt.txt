DEREGISTER AIG AS A SLHC OTHER REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AS DESCRIBED BELOW AIG HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS A GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT INSURER G SII IN ADDITION TO THE ADOPTION OF DODD FRANK IN THE UNITED STATES REGULATORS AND LAWMAKERS AROUND THE WORLD ARE ACTIVELY REVIEWING THE CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND TAKING STEPS TO AVOID SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD FSB CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF NATIONAL FINANCIAL AUTHORITIES OF THE G20 NATIONS HAS ISSUED A SERIES OF FRAMEWORKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS INTENDED TO PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HOW FINANCIAL COMPANIES PARTICULARLY GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE REGULATED THESE FRAMEWORKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES AS FINANCIAL GROUP SUPERVISION CAPITAL AND SOLVENCY STANDARDS SYSTEMIC ECONOMIC RISK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INCLUDING COMPENSATION AND A NUMBER OF RELATED ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONSES TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THE FSB HAS DIRECTED THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE SUPERVISORS THE IAIS HEADQUARTERED IN BASEL SWITZERLAND TO CREATE STANDARDS RELATIVE TO THESE AREAS AND INCORPORATE THEM WITHIN THAT BODY S INSURANCE CORE PRINCIPLES ICPS IAIS S ICPS FORM THE BASELINE THRESHOLD AGAINST WHICH COUNTRIES FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATORY EFFORTS IN THE INSURANCE SECTOR ARE MEASURED THAT MEASUREMENT IS MADE BY PERIODIC FINANCIAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT PROGRAM FSAP REVIEWS CONDUCTED BY THE WORLD BANK AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE REPORTS THEREON SPUR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTRY SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL OR AMENDED REGULATORY CHANGES LAWMAKERS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR SUBSIDIARIES CONDUCT BUSINESS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES CONSISTENT WITH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING PROPOSALS GOVERNING CONSOLIDATED REGULATION OF INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY IN JAPAN FINANCIAL AND BANKING REGULATION ADOPTED IN FRANCE AND COMPENSATION REGULATIONS PROPOSED OR ADOPTED BY THE FINANCIAL REGULATORS IN GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY THE FSB HAS ALSO CHARGED THE IAIS WITH DEVELOPING A TEMPLATE FOR MEASURING SYSTEMIC RISKS POSED BY INSURER GROUPS THE IAIS HAS REQUESTED DATA FROM SELECTED INSURERS AROUND THE WORLD TO DETERMINE WHICH ELEMENTS OF THE INSURANCE SECTOR IF ANY COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACT OTHER PARTS OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR E G COMMERCIAL AND INVESTMENT BANKING SECURITIES TRADING ETC THE IAIS HAS PROVIDED ITS ASSESSMENT TEMPLATE TO THE 184 ITEM 2 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FSB BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT TEMPLATE ON JULY 18 2013 THE FSB IN CONSULTATION WITH THE IAIS AND NATIONAL AUTHORITIES IDENTIFIED AN INITIAL LIST OF G SIIS WHICH INCLUDES AIG AS A G SII AIG WILL BE SUBJECT TO A POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION PLANNING REQUIREMENTS ENHANCED GROUP WIDE SUPERVISION AND HIGHER LOSS ABSORBENCY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE G SII POLICY FRAMEWORK WILL BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY 2019 THE IAIS IS ALSO DEVELOPING A COMFRAME A COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR THE SUPERVISION OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS IAIGS WHICH INCLUDES ADDITIONAL SUPERVISORY OVERSIGHT BASED ON ITS ICPS BUT ALSO ADDS REQUIREMENTS AND SUPERVISORY PROCESSES PERTAINING TO THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OF IAIGS AS CURRENTLY DELINEATED UNDER THE COMFRAME AIG MEETS THE PARAMETERS SET FORTH TO DEFINE AN IAIG WHILE WE CURRENTLY DO NOT KNOW WHEN ANY COMFRAME DIRECTIVES WILL BE FINALIZED AND BECOME EFFECTIVE THE IAIS WILL UNDERTAKE A FIELD TESTING OF THE COMFRAME INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR IAIGS WHICH IS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE IN THE BEGINNING OF 2014 IT IS EXPECTED THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMFRAME WOULD BEGIN IN 2019 LEGISLATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS THE SOLVENCY II DIRECTIVE 2009 138 EEC SOLVENCY II WHICH WAS ADOPTED ON NOVEMBER 25 2009 AND IS EXPECTED TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IN 2016 REFORMS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY S SOLVENCY FRAMEWORK INCLUDING MINIMUM CAPITAL AND SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS RISK MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC REPORTING STANDARDS THE IMPACT ON US WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER THE U S INSURANCE REGULATORY REGIME IS DEEMED EQUIVALENT TO SOLVENCY II IF THE U S INSURANCE REGULATORY REGIME IS NOT EQUIVALENT THEN WE ALONG WITH OTHER INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD BE REQUIRED TO BE SUPERVISED UNDER SOLVENCY II STANDARDS WHETHER THE U S INSURANCE REGULATORY REGIME WILL BE DEEMED EQUIVALENT IS STILL UNDER CONSIDERATION BY EUROPEAN AUTHORITIES AND REMAINS UNCERTAIN SO WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF SOLVENCY II WE EXPECT THAT THE REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO US AND OUR REGULATED ENTITIES WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS NAIC MODEL REGULATION VALUATION OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES
