CONTINUING TO REVIEW THE CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND TAKING STEPS TO AVOID SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR SUBSIDIARIES CONDUCT BUSINESS HAVE IMPLEMENTED LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES CONSISTENT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE WORLD BANK WHICH CONDUCT PERIODIC FINANCIAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT PROGRAM FSAP REVIEWS TO MEASURE LOCAL REGULATORY REGIMES AGAINST THE STANDARDS SET BY THE IAIS EXAMPLES INCLUDE UPDATED INSURANCE COMPANY ORDINANCES IN HONG KONG AND CONSOLIDATED REGULATION OF INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANIES BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY IN JAPAN THE FSB CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF NATIONAL FINANCIAL AUTHORITIES OF THE G20 COUNTRIES HAS ISSUED A SERIES OF FRAMEWORKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS INTENDED TO PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HOW FINANCIAL COMPANIES PARTICULARLY GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE REGULATED THESE FRAMEWORKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES AS SYSTEMIC FINANCIAL RISK FINANCIAL GROUP SUPERVISION CAPITAL AND SOLVENCY STANDARDS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INCLUDING COMPENSATION AND A NUMBER OF RELATED ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONSES TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS THE FSB HAS DIRECTED THE IAIS TO CREATE STANDARDS RELATIVE TO MANY OF THESE AREAS WHICH GO BEYOND THE IAIS BASIC INSURANCE CORE PRINCIPLES ICPS THE IAIS IS DEVELOPING COMFRAME A COMMON FRAMEWORK FOR THE SUPERVISION OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUPS IAIGS COMFRAME SETS OUT QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE STANDARDS IN ORDER TO ASSIST SUPERVISORS IN COLLECTIVELY ADDRESSING AN IAIGS ACTIVITIES AND RISKS IDENTIFYING AND AVOIDING REGULATORY GAPS AND COORDINATING SUPERVISORY ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH COMFRAME THE IAIS IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A RISK BASED GLOBAL INSURANCE CAPITAL STANDARD ICS APPLICABLE TO IAIGS WE CURRENTLY MEET THE PARAMETERS SET FORTH TO DEFINE AN IAIG COMFRAME STANDARDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED IN 2019 AND THE IAIS IS CONDUCTING FIELD TESTING OF COMFRAME INCLUDING THE ICS AHEAD OF THAT DEADLINE IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE COMFRAME AND ICS STANDARDS FINALLY ADOPTED BY THE IAIS WOULD BE READY FOR ADOPTION BY IMPLEMENTING MEMBER JURISDICTIONS BEGINNING IN 2020 THE IAIS INTENDS G SIIS TO BE SUBJECT TO A POLICY FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES RECOVERY AND RESOLUTION PLANNING ENHANCED GROUP WIDE SUPERVISION ENHANCED LIQUIDITY AND SYSTEMIC RISK MANAGEMENT PLANNING AND GROUP WIDE CAPITAL STANDARDS INCLUDING HLA CAPITAL THE IAIS BASIC CAPITAL REQUIREMENT BCR WAS ENDORSED BY THE FSB IN OCTOBER 2014 AND BY THE G20 COUNTRIES IN NOVEMBER 2014 THE BCR COVERS ALL GROUP ACTIVITIES AND WE REPORTED OUR BCR RATIOS TO NATIONAL AUTHORITIES ON A CONFIDENTIAL BASIS IN 2015 AND 2016 THE BCR SERVES AS THE INITIAL FOUNDATION FOR THE APPLICATION OF HLA REQUIREMENTS IN OCTOBER 2015 THE IAIS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD CONCLUDED INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE HLA REQUIREMENTS ACCORDING TO WHICH WE REPORTED ON A CONFIDENTIAL BASIS TO SUPERVISORS IN 2016 HLA REQUIREMENTS WERE ENDORSED BY THE FSB IN SEPTEMBER 2015 AND BY THE G20 COUNTRIES IN NOVEMBER 2015 BOTH THE BCR AND HLA REQUIREMENTS ARE CALCULATED FOR INSURANCE AND NON INSURANCE ACTIVITIES ULTIMATELY THE G SII POLICY FRAMEWORK IS EXPECTED TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE IAIS BY 2019 THE STANDARDS DISCUSSED ABOVE ISSUED BY THE FSB AND OR THE IAIS ARE NOT BINDING ON THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD UNLESS AND UNTIL THE APPROPRIATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL BODIES OR REGULATORS ADOPT APPROPRIATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AT THIS TIME IT
