3 BILLION IN CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND 5 5 BILLION IN FOREIGN TAX CREDITS TAX LOSSES AND CREDITS CARRYFORWARDS OUR ABILITY TO USE SUCH TAX ATTRIBUTES TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED IF WE EXPERIENCE AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE AS DEFINED IN SECTION 382 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 AS AMENDED THE CODE IN GENERAL AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE WILL OCCUR WHEN THE PERCENTAGE OF AIG PARENT S OWNERSHIP BY VALUE OF ONE OR MORE 5 PERCENT SHAREHOLDERS AS DEFINED IN THE CODE HAS INCREASED BY MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OVER THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE OWNED BY SUCH SHAREHOLDERS

THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TAX LOSSES AND CREDITS CARRYFORWARDS COULD EXPIRE BEFORE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THEM TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME ON MARCH 9 2011 OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED A TAX ASSET PROTECTION PLAN THE PLAN TO HELP PROTECT THESE TAX LOSSES AND CREDITS CARRYFORWARDS AT OUR 2011 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS SHAREHOLDERS RATIFIED THE PLAN AT THE SAME TIME SHAREHOLDERS ADOPTED A PROTECTIVE AMENDMENT TO OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT CERTAIN TRANSFERS OF AIG COMMON STOCK THAT COULD RESULT IN AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE THE PLAN IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE BY I DISCOURAGING ANY PERSON OR GROUP FROM BECOMING A 4 99 PERCENT SHAREHOLDER AND II DISCOURAGING ANY EXISTING 4 99 PERCENT SHAREHOLDER FROM ACQUIRING ADDITIONAL SHARES OF AIG COMMON STOCK THE PROTECTIVE AMENDMENT GENERALLY RESTRICTS ANY TRANSFER OF AIG COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD I INCREASE THE OWNERSHIP BY ANY PERSON TO 4 99 PERCENT OR MORE OF AIG STOCK THEN OUTSTANDING OR II INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF AIG STOCK OWNED BY A FIVE PERCENT STOCKHOLDER AS DEFINED IN THE PLAN DESPITE THE INTENTIONS OF THE PLAN AND THE PROTECTIVE AMENDMENT TO DETER AND PREVENT AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE SUCH AN EVENT MAY STILL OCCUR IN ADDITION THE PLAN AND THE PROTECTIVE AMENDMENT MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO ACQUIRE US AND MAY DISCOURAGE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OF AIG COMMON STOCK OR A NON NEGOTIATED TENDER OR EXCHANGE OFFER FOR AIG COMMON STOCK ACCORDINGLY THE PLAN AND THE PROTECTIVE AMENDMENT MAY LIMIT A SHAREHOLDER S ABILITY TO REALIZE A PREMIUM OVER THE MARKET PRICE OF AIG COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH ANY STOCK TRANSACTION CHANGES IN TAX LAWS COULD INCREASE OUR CORPORATE TAXES REDUCE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR MAKE SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS LESS ATTRACTIVE TO CONSUMERS CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS SOME PROPOSED CHANGES COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY REDUCING DEDUCTIONS OR INCREASING INCOME INCLUSIONS SUCH AS BY LIMITING RULES THAT ALLOW FOR DEFERRAL OF TAX ON CERTAIN FOREIGN INSURANCE INCOME CONVERSELY OTHER CHANGES SUCH AS LOWERING THE U S FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE DISCUSSED RECENTLY IN THE CONTEXT OF TAX REFORM COULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN ADDITION CHANGES IN THE WAY FOREIGN TAXES CAN BE CREDITED AGAINST U S TAXES METHODS FOR ALLOCATING INTEREST EXPENSE THE WAYS INSURANCE COMPANIES CALCULATE AND DEDUCT RESERVES FOR TAX PURPOSES AND IMPOSITIONS OF NEW OR CHANGED PREMIUM VALUE ADDED AND OTHER INDIRECT TAXES COULD INCREASE OUR TAX EXPENSE THEREBY REDUCING EARNINGS IN ADDITION TO PROPOSING TO CHANGE THE TAXATION OF CORPORATIONS IN GENERAL AND INSURANCE COMPANIES IN PARTICULAR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CONGRESS HAVE RECENTLY CONSIDERED PROPOSALS THAT COULD INCREASE TAXES ON OWNERS OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE PROPOSALS THAT WOULD LIMIT THE DEFERRAL OF TAX ON INCOME FROM LIFE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS RELATIVE TO OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCTS THESE CHANGES COULD REDUCE DEMAND IN THE U S FOR LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS OR CAUSE CONSUMERS TO SHIFT FROM THESE CONTRACTS TO OTHER INVESTMENTS WHICH WOULD REDUCE OUR INCOME DUE TO LOWER SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS OR POTENTIAL INCREASED SURRENDERS OF IN FORCE BUSINESS GOVERNMENTS NEED FOR ADDITIONAL REVENUE MAKES IT LIKELY THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUED PROPOSALS TO CHANGE TAX RULES IN WAYS THAT WOULD REDUCE OUR EARNINGS HOWEVER IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER OR WHEN THERE
