ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS INVESTING IN AIG INVOLVES RISK IN DECIDING WHETHER TO INVEST IN AIG YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS ANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OR MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY THEY COULD ALSO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS AND VOLATILITY IN THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES READERS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE FACTORS TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS THAT COULD AFFECT AIG THESE FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND THE OTHER REPORTS AND MATERIALS FILED BY US WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION SEC FURTHER MANY OF THESE RISKS ARE INTERRELATED AND COULD OCCUR UNDER SIMILAR BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN OF THEM MAY IN TURN CAUSE THE EMERGENCE OR EXACERBATE THE EFFECT OF OTHERS SUCH A COMBINATION COULD MATERIALLY INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF THE IMPACT OF THESE RISKS ON OUR BUSINESSES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY MARKET CONDITIONS DETERIORATION OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS OR WEAKENING IN GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY OUR BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS WEAKNESSES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND MARKET VOLATILITY HAVE IN THE PAST LED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE LEAD TO A POOR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT EROSION OF CONSUMER AND INVESTOR CONFIDENCE REDUCED BUSINESS VOLUMES DETERIORATING LIQUIDITY AND DECLINES IN ASSET VALUATIONS ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY RESULT FROM GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING PLATEAUING BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND INFLATIONARY PRESSURES IN DEVELOPED ECONOMIES UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING CHINAS ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MAINTAIN GROWTH THE EFFECTS OF BREXIT AS DEFINED BELOW ON BUSINESS INVESTMENT HIRING MIGRATION AND LABOR SUPPLY AND INTENSIFYING TRADE PROTECTIONISM THESE AND OTHER MARKET ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESSES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY IN MANY WAYS INCLUDING I LOWER LEVELS OF CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT COULD DECREASE REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY AND DECREASE VALUE IN GOODWILL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND OTHER LONG TERM ASSETS II INCREASES IN CREDIT SPREADS AND DEFAULTS THAT COULD REDUCE INVESTMENT ASSET VALUATIONS INCREASE CREDIT LOSSES ACROSS NUMEROUS ASSET CLASSES AND INCREASE STATUTORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND III INCREASED MARKET VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY THAT COULD DECREASE LIQUIDITY AND INCREASE BORROWING COSTS OTHER WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO INCREASES IN POLICY SURRENDERS AND CANCELLATIONS WRITE OFFS OF DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS INCREASES IN LIABILITY FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS DUE TO LOSS RECOGNITION ON CERTAIN LONG DURATION INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INCREASES IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THIRD PARTY REINSURANCE OR DECREASED ABILITY TO OBTAIN REINSURANCE AT ACCEPTABLE TERMS SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATES OR RAPIDLY INCREASING INTEREST RATES MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY ALTHOUGH INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN RISING RECENTLY PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES RATES REMAIN LOW RELATIVE TO HISTORICAL LEVELS SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATES CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND REDUCE THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT INCOME EARNED ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS IF A LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT PERSISTS WE MAY EXPERIENCE LOWER INVESTMENT INCOME DUE TO PRACTICAL AND CAPITAL MARKETS LIMITATIONS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY MITIGATE OUR INTEREST RATE RISK BY MATCHING EXPOSURE OF OUR ASSETS RELATIVE TO OUR LIABILITIES CONTINUED LOW INTEREST RATES COULD ALSO IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO EARN THE RETURNS ASSUMED IN THE PRICING AND THE RESERVING FOR OUR PRODUCTS AT THE TIME THEY WERE SOLD AND ISSUED CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY BE CORRELATED WITH INFLATION TRENDS WHICH WOULD IMPACT OUR LOSS TRENDS ON THE OTHER HAND IN PERIODS OF RAPIDLY INCREASING INTEREST RATES WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE IN A TIMELY MANNER THE INVESTMENTS IN OUR GENERAL ACCOUNT WITH HIGHER YIELDING INVESTMENTS NEEDED TO FUND THE HIGHER CREDITING RATES NECESSARY TO KEEP INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE PRODUCTS COMPETITIVE THEREFORE WE MAY HAVE TO ACCEPT A LOWER INVESTMENT SPREAD AND THUS LOWER PROFITABILITY OR FACE A DECLINE IN SALES AND GREATER LOSS OF EXISTING CONTRACTS AND RELATED ASSETS IN ADDITION POLICY LOANS SURRENDERS AND WITHDRAWALS TEND TO INCREASE AS POLICYHOLDERS SEEK INVESTMENTS WITH HIGHER PERCEIVED RETURNS AS INTEREST RATES RISE THIS PROCESS MAY RESULT IN CASH OUTFLOWS REQUIRING THAT WE SELL INVESTMENTS AT A TIME WHEN THE PRICES OF THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES THIS MAY RESULT IN REALIZED INVESTMENT LOSSES AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO FOR EXAMPLE BY DECREASING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES THAT COMPRISE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THIS IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RESERVES AND EXPOSURES INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE LIABILITIES ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MAY EXCEED THE RELATED RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES WE REGULARLY REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ESTABLISHED LOSS RESERVES AND CONDUCT EXTENSIVE ANALYSES OF OUR RESERVES DURING THE YEAR OUR LOSS RESERVES HOWEVER MAY DEVELOP ADVERSELY AND MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY AIG 2018 FORM 10 K 17 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS FOR GENERAL INSURANCE ESTIMATION OF ULTIMATE NET LOSSES LOSS

ENVIRONMENTAL WORKERS COMPENSATION EXCESS CASUALTY AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT COVERAGES INSURANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR LARGE CORPORATE CUSTOMERS AND OTHER CUSTOMIZED STRUCTURED INSURANCE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS EXCESS AND UMBRELLA LIABILITY ERRORS AND OMISSIONS PRODUCTS LIABILITY PROGRAMS AND SPECIALTY THERE IS ALSO GREATER UNCERTAINTY IN ESTABLISHING RESERVES WITH RESPECT TO NEW BUSINESS PARTICULARLY NEW BUSINESS THAT IS GENERATED WITH RESPECT TO MORE RECENTLY INTRODUCED PRODUCT LINES IN THESE CASES THERE IS LESS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE AND LESS DATA UPON WHICH THE ACTUARIES CAN RELY ESTIMATING RESERVES IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY UNEXPECTED CLAIMS OR UNINTENDED COVERAGES THAT EMERGE DUE TO CHANGING CONDITIONS THESE EMERGING ISSUES MAY INCREASE THE SIZE OR NUMBER OF CLAIMS BEYOND OUR UNDERWRITING INTENT AND MAY NOT BECOME APPARENT FOR MANY YEARS AFTER A POLICY IS ISSUED WHILE WE USE A NUMBER OF ANALYTICAL RESERVE DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES TO PROJECT FUTURE LOSS DEVELOPMENT RESERVES HAVE BEEN AND MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS OR LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTORS THAT WERE RELIED UPON IN SETTING THE RESERVES FOR EXAMPLE IN 2018 2017 AND 2016 WE RECORDED PRE TAX NET CHARGES OF 1 4 BILLION 1 6 BILLION AND 5 8 BILLION RESPECTIVELY TO STRENGTHEN OUR GENERAL INSURANCE LOSS RESERVES REFLECTING ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT IN CLASSES OF BUSINESS WITH LONG REPORTING TAILS PRIMARILY IN CASUALTY AND FINANCIAL LINES THESE CHANGES IN LOSS COST TRENDS OR LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTORS COULD BE DUE TO CHANGES IN ACTUAL VERSUS EXPECTED CLAIMS AND LOSSES DIFFICULTIES IN PREDICTING CHANGES SUCH AS CHANGES IN INFLATION UNEMPLOYMENT DURATION OR OTHER SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING CLAIMS INCLUDING JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE APPROACHES ANY DEVIATION IN LOSS COST TRENDS OR IN LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTORS MIGHT NOT BE IDENTIFIED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AFTER WE RECORD THE INITIAL LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES FOR ANY ACCIDENT YEAR OR NUMBER OF YEARS FOR LIFE AND RETIREMENT EXPERIENCE MAY DEVELOP ADVERSELY SUCH THAT ADDITIONAL RESERVES MUST BE ESTABLISHED ADVERSE EXPERIENCE COULD ARISE OUT OF A SEVERE SHORT TERM EVENT SUCH AS A PANDEMIC OR DUE TO MISESTIMATION OF LONG TERM ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT AND INTEREST RATE ASSUMPTIONS WHILE MORTALITY EXPERIENCE IS RELATIVELY STABLE DUE TO THE LARGE AMOUNT OF HISTORICAL DATA AVAILABLE ASSUMPTIONS IN RESPECT OF OTHER VARIABLES SUCH AS POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR CAN BE MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE AND MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RESERVES LIFE AND RETIREMENT RESERVES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

IN THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS TO OUR PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONS NATURAL AND MAN MADE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS ARE GENERALLY UNPREDICTABLE OUR EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHIC RELATED LOSS DEPENDS ON VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF THE CATASTROPHES THE RATE OF INFLATION AND THE VALUE AND GEOGRAPHIC OR OTHER CONCENTRATIONS OF INSURED

PROTECT US AGAINST LOSSES OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE MAJOR PURCHASERS OF THIRD PARTY REINSURANCE AND WE USE REINSURANCE AS PART OF OUR OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY OUR REINSURANCE BUSINESS ALSO PURCHASES RETROCESSIONAL REINSURANCE WHICH ALLOWS A REINSURER TO CEDE TO ANOTHER COMPANY ALL OR PART OF THE REINSURANCE OBLIGATIONS ORIGINALLY ASSUMED BY THE REINSURER WHILE REINSURANCE DOES NOT DISCHARGE OUR SUBSIDIARIES FROM THEIR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS FOR LOSSES INSURED OR REINSURED UNDER OUR POLICIES IT DOES MAKE THE REINSURER LIABLE TO THE SUBSIDIARIES FOR THE REINSURED PORTION OF THE
