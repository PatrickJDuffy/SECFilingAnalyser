effective as of january 1 2011 chartis ceded the bulk of its net asbestos liabilities to nico under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of 3 5 billion chartis paid nico approximately 1 67 billion as consideration for this cession and nico assumed approximately 1 82 billion of net asbestos liabilities as a result of this transaction chartis recorded a deferred gain of

from time to time and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes see capital resources and liquidity herein and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions 103 table of contents american international group inc outlook priorities for 2011 and beyond aig is focused on the following priorities for the remainder of 2011 and beyond continuing to strengthen and grow aig businesses developing and implementing plans to maximize the value of resources available for repayment of the aia spv preferred interests held by the department of the treasury implementing a strategic alternative for ilfc through an initial public offering or sale continuing to build strengthen and streamline the financial and operating systems infrastructure throughout the organization particularly in financial reporting financial operations and human resources restructuring aig operations consistent with its smaller size and plans to increase its competitiveness managing its capital more efficiently investing its available cash in order to increase its net investment income and continuing to work towards achieving the long term aspirational goals with respect to return on equity and earnings per share as discussed in aig 2011 first quarter form 10 q chartis given the recent global economic environment and current property and casualty market conditions the remainder of 2011 and the first part of 2012 are expected to remain challenging but improving trends in certain key indicators may offset some of the challenges the weakness of ratable exposures i e asset values payrolls and sales experienced in 2009 and 2010 and its negative impact on the overall market premium base as well as continued weakness in commercial insurance rates were initially expected to continue through 2011 however in the first nine months of 2011 chartis has observed that the extent of ratable exposure weakness in the united states is beginning to abate in addition beginning in the second quarter of 2011 and continuing through the third quarter of 2011 chartis has observed continuing positive pricing trends particularly in its u s commercial business for the first time since 2009 in certain growth economies such as brazil turkey india and asia pacific countries chartis continues to expect improved growth strategy chartis continues to execute its strategy to grow its higher margin and less capital intensive lines of business and to implement corrective actions on underperforming businesses management continues to review its underlying businesses to ensure that they meet overall performance measures while seeking to reduce overall volatility in 2011 chartis determined that it would no longer write excess workers compensation business as an unsupported stand alone product however given its commitments to certain insureds to allow them to move their business to other insurance providers in an orderly manner chartis will continue to report modest net premium written activity over the next 12 months excess workers compensation is also subject to premium audits upon the expiration of underlying policies and as a result premium audit activity is expected to continue through subsequent years additionally during the third quarter of 2011 chartis began to restructure renewals of certain commercial casualty loss sensitive programs from a retrospectively rated premium structure to a loss reimbursement deductible structure the deductible structure reduces net premiums written and limits the variability around individual insured premium and claim adjustments when compared to retrospectively rated programs this overall reduction in the premium and claims adjustment variability creates a corresponding reduction in the required capital needed to support this business management expects similar levels of declining net premium written trends in this class of business to continue through the second quarter of 2012 104 table of contents american international group inc the effect of these initiatives decreased net written premiums in the third quarter of 2011 by approximately 323 million however given the capital intensive nature of these classes of business chartis expects that over time these actions will improve its overall return on equity and cost of capital efficiency metrics as discussed above in 2011 commercial insurance has continued to experience a decrease in its net premiums written as it executes strategies to restructure certain loss sensitive programs to meet its profitability objectives commercial insurance is focused on growing higher margin classes of business including financial lines and specialty coverages such as aerospace and it is growing its business in regions of opportunity commercial insurance is leveraging its significant geographic footprint and multinational capabilities to serve large and mid sized businesses with cross border operations chartis is also expanding its presence in the growth economies region which primarily includes asia pacific the middle east and latin america to increase financial casualty and specialty lines of business and given its new global organizational design more effectively leverage underwriting and product best practices to enhance customer and channel management in the u s canada and europe regions commercial insurance expects to improve the quality of its portfolio in the far east region management expects to leverage the additional distribution and customer base acquired in connection with the purchase of fuji consumer insurance expects continued growth in net premiums written in 2011 and 2012 as a result of its well established franchises and operations existing growth strategies in multiple distribution channels and its focus on countries in the growth economies region by implementing selective pricing underwriting and distribution strategies net premiums written are expected to grow without increasing chartis overall catastrophe exposure in the u s and canada region management has focused on expanding the personal lines business such as coverages for the private client group which target high net worth and affluent customers in the far east region management will continue to integrate fuji operationally and benefit from the full year effect of rate increases in the europe region management has focused on maintaining pricing discipline and has observed modest growth consumer insurance continues to grow steadily in the growth economies region across all lines of business as a result of growth in the gross domestic product of countries within this region and management focused execution consumer insurance generally carries higher acquisition costs than commercial insurance and as a result chartis expects an overall increase in its expense ratio in 2011 and 2012 due to the change in the mix of business between commercial insurance and consumer insurance further investment in the growth economies region is also expected to increase expenses in 2012 however increases in these expenses are expected to generate business with favorable combined ratios and return on equity measures catastrophes thailand has suffered catastrophic flooding at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011 for which chartis expects claims to be reported in the coming quarter chartis is currently analyzing its exposures and as of october 31 2011 cannot yet quantify liabilities that may result from these events asbestos liabilities as part of chartis ongoing strategy to reduce its overall loss reserve development risk on june 17 2011 but with retroactive effect to january 1 2011 chartis completed a transaction with nico a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc under which the bulk of chartis domestic asbestos liabilities were transferred to nico the transaction with nico covers potentially volatile u s related asbestos exposures the transaction does not cover asbestos accounts that chartis believes have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by chartis subsidiaries the transfer was effected under a reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of 3 5 billion chartis paid nico approximately 1 67 billion as consideration for this cession and nico assumed approximately 1 82 billion of net asbestos liabilities in connection with this transaction chartis recorded a deferred gain of 150 million in the second quarter of 2011 which is being amortized into the chartis results of operations over the settlement period of the underlying claims 105 table of contents american international group inc under gaap any future loss development on this retroactive reinsurance agreement will be reported in the period recognized through the results of operations the corresponding recovery from nico will be deferred and consistent with the original deferred gain amortized into the results of operations over the settlement period of the underlying claims investments consistent with aig worldwide insurance investment policy chartis places primary emphasis on investments in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies and to a lesser extent common stocks real estate hedge funds and other alternative investments domestically fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in chartis historically have consisted primarily of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in order to better optimize its overall investment portfolio including risk return and tax objectives of chartis the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives chartis makes determinations of other than temporary impairments based on the fundamental credit analyses of individual securities for the chartis other invested asset classes more specifically life settlements contracts impairments are evaluated on a contract by contract basis during the second quarter of 2011 chartis implemented an enhanced process in which updated medical information on individual insured lives is requested on a routine basis in cases where updated information indicates that an individual health has improved an impairment loss may arise as a result of revised estimates of net cash flows from the related contract chartis also revised its valuation table which it is using in estimating future net cash flows this had the general effect of decreasing the projected net cash flows on a number of contracts these changes resulted in an increase in the number of life settlement contracts identified as potentially impaired compared to previous analyses as the overall book of business continues to mature and new medical information continues to become available regarding insureds updated life expectancy assumptions may result in an increase in impairments relating to these assets at september 30 2011 chartis held 5 998 life settlement contracts included in other invested assets with a carrying value of 4 1 billion and a face value of 19 1 billion recently a number of courts have addressed various life settlement related issues in their decisions chartis does not expect that the rulings in those cases will have a significant effect on its investment in life settlement contracts in october 2010 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts the accounting standard update will result in a decrease in the amount of capitalized costs in connection with the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts because aig will only defer costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal business aig is currently assessing the effect of adoption of this new standard on its consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows see note 2 to the consolidated

repositioning its excess cash and liquidity maintaining a strong statutory surplus pro actively managing expenses and subject to regulatory approval increasing dividends paid to aig parent sunamerica

financial crisis variable annuity distribution partner resumed distribution of sunamerica products in mid 2011 as a result of broader distribution opportunities sunamerica expects variable annuity sales to continue to improve over 2010 levels after a period of historic lows interest rates generally increased at the longer part of the yield curve during the latter part of 2010 and through the first three months of 2011 before declining significantly in the third quarter of 2011 changes in the interest rate environment affect the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products as a result sunamerica fixed annuity sales declined sequentially from the second quarter of 2011 if the low interest rate environment continues sunamerica expects fixed annuities sales to decline from the levels experienced in the first six months of 2011 life insurance sunamerica life insurance business continues to deepen its relationships with its retail independent distributors and expects new life insurance sales to continue to grow at or above industry averages additionally the direct to consumer channel has proven to be a highly effective method for consumers

distribution is focused on agent retention and improving productivity investments sunamerica built up a large cash and short term investment position in the first quarter of 2011 with the intention of purchasing all the assets in the ml ii portfolio with the frbny decision in early 2011 to sell the mlii assets through a competitive sales process sunamerica began acquiring other fixed maturity investments including certain securities from ml ii beginning late in the first quarter of 2011 sunamerica started investing its excess cash and liquid assets in longer term higher yielding securities to improve spreads while actively managing credit and liquidity risks sunamerica made substantial progress commencing in the latter part of the first quarter of 2011 in reducing its cash and short term investment position from 19 4 billion at december 31 2010 to 3 8 billion at september 30 2011 during 2011 sunamerica sold approximately 9 6 billion of investments in order to support statutory capital and to generate capital gains to partially preserve the recoverability of the deferred tax assets relating to capital losses and reinvested the proceeds at generally lower rates additionally during prolonged periods of low or declining interest rates sunamerica has to re invest interest and principal payments from its investment portfolios in lower yielding securities sunamerica annuity and universal life products have minimum guaranteed interest rates and other contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals as a result continuation of the current low interest rate environment will put pressure on sunamerica interest spreads which may reduce future profitability sunamerica mitigates this risk through its asset liability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies as indicated in the table below approximately 41 percent of sunamerica annuity and universal life account values are currently at their minimum crediting rates as of september 30 2011 currently these products have minimum guaranteed interest rates ranging from 1 0 percent to 5 5 percent with the higher rates representing older product

negative returns in the third quarter of 2011 due to this lag in reporting actual partnership results from the third quarter of 2011 for certain partnerships will be reported in aig fourth quarter

rate to be applied to year to date income from the third quarter of 2008 through december 31 2010 the discrete period method was used to compute the interim tax provisions due to the significant variations in the customary relationship between income tax expense and pre tax accounting income the estimated annual effective tax rates for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2011 exclude the tax effects of current year losses of the u s consolidated income tax group and in japan fuji the related tax benefit with respect to these jurisdictions is currently projected to be offset by an increase in the valuation allowance prior to intraperiod tax allocation certain items including losses in jurisdictions where no corresponding tax benefit is available and those deemed to be unusual infrequent or that cannot be reliably estimated are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate in these cases the actual tax expense or benefit applicable to that item is treated

expenses incurred and underwriting expenses net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies for short duration contracts the unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally recognized in earnings ratably over the policy period net premiums written for long duration contracts are recognized when due from the policyholder net premiums written reflect the premiums retained after purchasing reinsurance protection chartis along with most property and casualty insurance companies uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance the loss ratio is the sum of claims and claims adjustment expenses divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is underwriting expenses which consist of acquisition costs plus other insurance expenses divided by net premiums earned the combined ratio is a sum of the loss ratio and expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of claims claims adjustment expenses and other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit and over 100 indicates an underwriting loss the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affects such ratios regulation product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and the combined ratio going forward chartis will continue to assess the performance of its operating segments based in part on underwriting income however chartis is implementing a risk adjusted profitability model which will serve as its primary business performance measure when it is fully deployed along with underwriting results this model incorporates elements of capital allocations costs of capital and components of net investment income when the model is fully deployed components of net investment income will be included in each of the chartis operating segments as noted above net investment income is included only

management initiatives within commercial insurance designed to provide for a more effective use of capital including restructuring the renewals of certain commercial casualty loss sensitive programs from a retrospectively rated premium structure to a loss reimbursement deductible structure and management decision to cease writing excess workers compensation business as a stand alone product the effect of these actions decreased premiums in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2011 by approximately 323 million and 422 million respectively however given the capital intensive nature of these classes of casualty business chartis expects that over time these actions will improve its overall return on equity and cost of capital efficiency metrics partially offsetting these

substantially all of fuji business is part of consumer insurance chartis recorded amortization of deferred acquisition costs of 112 million for the three month period ended september 30 2011 compared

three quarters of fuji operations while the corresponding 2010 period reflects fuji operations for one quarter fuji has a lower average expense ratio than the rest of the consumer insurance business which resulted in the overall decrease in the expense ratio in addition the expense ratio decreased due to the benefit associated from the amortization of net intangible liabilities from the fuji

accounting and claims system implementations solvency ii and certain other legal entity restructuring initiatives investing results for the three months ended september 30 2011 the increase in net investment income is due to increases in interest relating to fixed maturity securities due to the continued shift in investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments within the u s which meet overall liquidity duration and quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives in addition the increase relates to redeployment of cash and short term instruments into to longer term higher yield securities this increase is partially offset by reduced gains on matured life settlement contracts the increase in net investment income for the nine months ended september 30 2011 was due in part to fuji investment income which has been consolidated in the chartis results since july 1 2010 for the three and nine months ended september 30 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 increases in net realized capital gains and losses are due to gains on the sales of fixed maturity securities primarily municipal bonds in connection with the aforementioned strategy to better align chartis investment allocations with current overall performance and tax objectives in addition the increase is due to foreign exchange transaction gains on derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting which were primarily the result of the strengthening of the japanese yen against the u s dollar these gains were partially offset by other

survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at september 30 2011 and 2010 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments in addition aig survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007 these settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at september 30 2010 by approximately 0 2 years and 0 6 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aig determination of its reserves are not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these

for mid generation aircraft the higher production rates sustained by manufacturers for more fuel efficient newer generation aircraft during the recent economic downturn the unfavorable impact of low rates of inflation on aircraft values current market conditions and future industry outlook for future marketing of older mid generation and out of production aircraft and decreasing number of lessees

its impact on ilfc strategy while ilfc overall business model has not changed its expectation of how it may manage out of production aircraft or aircraft that have been affected by new technology developments changed due to the aeroturbine acquisition the acquisition of aeroturbine provides ilfc with increased choices in managing the end of life of aircraft in its fleet and makes the part out of an aircraft a more economically and commercially viable option by bringing the requisite capabilities in house and eliminating the payment of commissions to third parties parting out aircraft will also enable ilfc to retain more cash flows from an aircraft during the last cycle of its life by allowing ilfc to eliminate certain maintenance costs and realize higher net overhaul revenues as part of the assessment performed during the three months ended september 30 2011 management performed a review of aircraft in its fleet that are currently out of production or have been affected by new

aeroturbine acquisition most of the aircraft reviewed were in the second half of their estimated 25 year useful life the current economic environment for these aircraft has been challenging and the outlook is expected to become more challenging due to the trends noted above all of these factors contributed to management conclusion that many of these aircraft would be disposed of prior to the end of their previously estimated useful life the result of the assessment based on ilfc updated assumptions and management change in its end of life strategy for older generation aircraft indicated that the book value of 95 aircraft were not fully recoverable and these aircraft were deemed impaired as of september 30 2011 the aircraft impaired were primarily out of production aircraft or aircraft

address loan documentation issues the higher claims and claims adjustment expenses were partially offset by lower levels of newly reported delinquencies in the first lien second lien and international products and higher denials and rescissions primarily on first lien claims and a reduction in reserves due to an agreement to resolve certain delinquencies with a major european lender that resulted in a 43 million benefit and the accrual in response to the court judgment in 2011 discussed above partially offsetting these declines was a reduction in underwriting expenses reflecting a 94 million

the direct investment book reported pre tax income in the three month period ended september 30 2011 compared to a pre tax loss in the same period in 2010 primarily due to gains on the credit valuation adjustment on the non derivative liabilities accounted for under the fair value option which more than offset negative credit valuation adjustments on the non derivative asset portfolio this

september 30 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the dib pre tax income decreased slightly due to lower net gains on credit valuation adjustments on non derivative assets and liabilities

quarters and reduced interest rates in the third quarter corporate and other corporate and other reported a decline in pre tax losses in the three month period ended september 30 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the frbny credit facility and net realized capital gains in 2011 compared to net realized capital losses in 2010 primarily due to the realized gains on euro and british pound denominated debt as a result of strengthening of the u s dollar against the euro and british pound in 2011 compared to u s

mostly offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of 3 3 billion in connection with the recapitalization primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset

which include the payment of maturing debt of aig and its subsidiaries liquidity adequacy management in 2010 aig implemented a stress testing and liquidity framework to systematically assess aig aggregate exposure to its most significant risks this framework is built on aig existing enterprise risk management erm stress testing methodology for both insurance and non insurance operations the scenarios are performed with a two year time horizon and capital adequacy requirements consider both financial and insurance risks aig insurance operations must comply with numerous constraints on their minimum capital positions these constraints are guiding requirements for capital adequacy for individual businesses based on capital assessments under rating agency regulatory and business requirements using erm stress testing methodology the capital impact of potential stresses is evaluated relative to the binding capital constraint of each business operation in order to determine aig

companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits but the ability of chartis to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies policy retention rates and operating expenses excluding the impact of the nico cession and catastrophes cash provided by aig reportable segments for the first nine months of 2011 is consistent with the same period of 2010 as increases in claims paid were offset by increases in premiums collected at the insurance organizations the significant increase in cash provided by investing activities in the first nine months of 2011 was primarily attributable to the utilization of 26 4 billion of restricted cash generated from the aia ipo and alico sale in

business needs of each operating unit the investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses general insurance life insurance retirement services and the direct investment book the primary objectives are generation of investment income preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products at the local operating unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at aig consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities in the case of life insurance and retirement services companies as well as in the direct investment book the fundamental investment strategy is as nearly as is practicable to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration domestically fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in chartis historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in order to meet the current risk return and tax objectives of chartis the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by chartis companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities the market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components including interest rate environment credit spread embedded optionality such as call features liquidity structural complexity foreign exchange risk and other credit and non credit factors however in most circumstances pricing is most sensitive to interest rates such that the market price declines as interest rates rise and increases as interest rates fall this effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities aig accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value however with limited exceptions primarily with respect to separate account products on aig consolidated balance sheet aig does not modify the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities and falling interest rates have the opposite effect this results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains losses on securities in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative inverse changes in gains losses on aig liabilities because aig asset duration in certain low yield currencies particularly japan is shorter than its liability duration aig views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous

for those securities for most security types supported by real estate related assets current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities this is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors in addition for floating

by estimating the fair value of each of aig reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units including allocated goodwill the estimate of a reporting unit fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market based earning multiples of the unit peer companies discounted expected future cash flows external appraisals or in the case of reporting units being considered for sale third party indications of fair value if available management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired the amount of impairment if any is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill

aigfp estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 0 99 years aigfp has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations of super senior regulatory capital cdss initiated by counterparties however during the second quarter of 2011 aigfp terminated mezzanine tranches related to certain terminated super senior regulatory capital trades and made payments which approximated their fair values at the time of termination the regulatory benefit of these transactions for aigfp financial institution counterparties was generally derived from basel i in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision finalized basel iii which when fully implemented may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions in prior years it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from basel i to an intermediate standard known as basel ii which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions at the end of 2009 basel iii has now superseded basel ii but the details of its implementation by the various european central banking districts have not been finalized should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame the weighted average expected maturity of the regulatory capital portfolio decreased as of september 30 2011 by approximately 2 2 years from december 31 2010 due to the termination of two transactions that had a longer than average weighted average maturity because the remaining counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early aigfp has extended the expected maturity dates by one year which is based on how long aigfp believes the relevant rules under basel i will remain effective these counterparties in the corporate loan and prime residential mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits under basel i rules and thus aig continues to categorize them as regulatory capital transactions during the second quarter of 2011 aigfp terminated two super senior prime

were terminated at values that approximated their collective fair value at the time of termination during the third quarter of 2011 hedge transactions with a net notional amount of 427 million were terminated at values that approximated their fair value at the time of termination the terminations had a positive net cash flow effect on aig due to the return of previously posted collateral in light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data to the extent deemed relevant and available aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2011 other than for transactions where aigfp believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above although aigfp believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties the counterparties early termination rights and aigfp expectation that such rights will be exercised preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these

and 23 9 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions in general each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand alone master agreement or similar agreement under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction the underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty and there is no standard formula the varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties the following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio reference to market indices under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index such as either itraxx or cdx this mechanism is used for cds transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages while the market index is not a direct proxy it has the advantage of being readily obtainable expected loss models under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses generally determined using a rating agency model 197 table of contents american international group inc negotiated amount under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between aigfp and the counterparty which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of

sector cdos in the cds transactions with physical settlement provisions in respect of multi sector cdos the standard csa provisions for the calculation of exposure have been modified with the exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying cdo security rather than the replacement value of the transaction as of any date the market value of the relevant cdo security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such cdo security in a market transaction on such date while the replacement value of the transaction is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation e g the cdo security in cases where a formula is utilized a transaction specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of exposure which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted these thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of aig and or the reference obligations with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings for the large majority of counterparties to these transactions the master agreement and csa cover non cds transactions e g interest rate and cross currency swap transactions

collateral arrangements due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements aigfp regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences valuation

swap portfolio the following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions as of the periods ended data table removed the amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of aig credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor while a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined aigfp estimates the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with its super senior credit default swaps using various methodologies the contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into aig liquidity planning assumptions valuation sensitivity arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aig calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average prices for cdos decreased during 2011 further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the total 5 7 billion net notional amount of cds written on multi sector cdos outstanding at september 30 2011 a bet value is available for 3 6 billion net notional amount no bet value is determined for 2 1 billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 3 6 billion the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities while the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a cdo the changes are subject to actual market 199 table of contents american international group inc conditions which have proved to be
