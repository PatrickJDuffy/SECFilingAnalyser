throughout this md and a we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful representative and most transparent some of the measurements we use are non gaap financial measures under sec rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the non gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis we believe book value per common share excluding aoci is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of non cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale portfolio and foreign currency translation adjustments book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented below in the executive overview section of this md and a we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of aig and our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided in the results of operations section of this md and a aig after tax operating income loss attributable to aig is derived by excluding the following items from net income loss attributable to aig income loss from discontinued operations net loss gain on sale of divested businesses income from divested businesses legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax adjustments legal reserves settlements related to legacy crisis matters deferred income tax valuation allowance releases charges changes in fair value of aig life and

sia related to net realized capital gains losses gain loss on extinguishment of debt net realized capital gains losses non qualifying derivative hedging activities excluding net realized capital gains losses and bargain purchase gain legacy crisis matters include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our september 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred by aig as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters aig property casualty operating income loss includes both underwriting income loss and net investment income but excludes net realized capital gains losses other income expense legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above and bargain purchase gain underwriting income loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expense acquisition expense and general operating expense ratios aig property casualty along with most property and casualty insurance companies uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of claims and claims adjustment expense and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss ratio as adjusted the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on aig property casualty in excess of 10 million each 79 item 2 use of non gaap measures accident year combined ratio as adjusted the combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting aig life and retirement operating income loss is derived by excluding the following items from net income loss legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities net of interest expense net realized capital gains losses and changes in benefit reserves and dac voba and sia related to net realized capital gains losses we believe that operating income loss is useful because excluding these volatile items permits investors to better assess the operating performance of the underlying business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations premiums and deposits includes life insurance premiums and deposits on annuity contracts guaranteed investment contracts gics and mutual funds other operations operating income loss income loss excluding certain legal reserves settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above gain loss on extinguishment of debt net realized

by the accident year combined ratio as adjusted which declined to 96 5 and 97 0 respectively compared to 98 3 and 99 3 in the same periods in the prior year net investment income in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2013 also benefited from the strong performance of alternative investments and gains on fair value option securities aig life and retirement reported growth in assets under

previous investments in maiden lane ii llc ml ii maiden lane iii llc ml iii and aia group limited aia improved in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 through yield enhancement initiatives including the reduction of our concentration in lower yielding tax exempt municipal securities and the purchase of higher yielding securities the investment portfolio performance also improved due to an increase in alternative investment income primarily as a result of favorable equity market performance in the six months ended june 30 2013 realized capital gains improved in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 because certain assets in unrealized gain positions were sold as part of a program to utilize capital loss carryforwards we reduced our debt in the first half of 2013 as a result of maturities repayments and purchases of 5 6 billion of debt including the redemption of 1 1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7 70 percent series a 5 junior subordinated debentures and the redemption of 750 million aggregate principal amount of our 6 45 percent series a 4 junior subordinated

debentures capital securities issued by three statutory trusts controlled by aig life holdings inc aiglh and senior debentures we had assumed that were originally issued by sunamerica inc we also made other repayments of approximately 2 7 billion as a result of the redemptions and cash tender offers we expect annual interest expense to decrease by approximately 213 million we maintained financial

revenues and expenses were conformed to the current period presentation these changes did not affect income from continuing operations before income tax expense or net income attributable to aig also the presentation of the operating segments within the aig life and retirement segment was revised in the first quarter of 2013 to reflect two new operating segments retail and institutional for further discussion see notes 1 and 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements investment highlights net investment income decreased 31 percent to 8 0 billion in the six months ended june 30 2013 compared to the same period of 2012 primarily due to fair value gains in 2012 on our investments in ml ii ml iii and aia which were liquidated during 2012 the overall credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was largely unchanged our insurance operations achieved a 407 million increase in net investment income due to higher alternative investment income for the six months ended june 30 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 net investment income improved due to higher alternative investment income driven primarily by equity market gains which was partially offset by the absence of ml ii gains in the first half of 2013 compared to 2012 while corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations we continued to make investments in structured securities and fixed income securities with attractive and appropriate risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income 84 item 2 executive overview net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio declined to approximately 14 billion as of june 30 2013 from approximately 25 billion as of december 31 2012 due to increases in interest rates and the realization of over 1 5 billion in gains other than temporary impairments were significantly lower during the first six months of 2013 than the prior year in part driven by favorable developments in the housing sector that led to strong performance in our structured products portfolios strategic outlook industry trends our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates credit and equity market conditions catastrophic claims events regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continue to operate under difficult market conditions in 2013 characterized by factors such as low interest rates instability in the global markets due to the european debt crisis and slow growth in the u s economy low interest rates in the u s fixed income market relative to historic levels have significantly affected our industry by reducing investment returns in addition current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines aig priorities for 2013 aig remains focused on the following priorities for 2013 strengthen and improve the operating performance of our core businesses consummate the sale of up to 90 percent of our interest in ilfc enhance the yield on our investments while maintaining focus on credit quality manage our capital and interest expense more efficiently by improving our capital structure and redeploying excess capital in areas that promote profitable growth work with the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb in its capacity as our principal regulator and reduce operating expenses by leveraging our scale and driving increased standardization through investments in infrastructure outlook for our operating businesses the outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2013 and over the longer term is summarized below see our 2012 annual report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses aig property casualty outlook we expect that the current low interest rate environment and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets through at least the end of 2013 due to these conditions coupled with overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry we have sought to tighten terms and conditions shed unprofitable business and develop advanced data analytics to improve profitability 85 item 2 executive overview we have observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges commencing in the second quarter of 2011 and continuing since we have benefitted from favorable pricing trends particularly in our u s commercial business the property casualty insurance industry is experiencing modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in some markets we expect that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions as part of our strategy to expand our consumer operations in emerging markets on may 29 2013 we entered into a joint venture agreement with picc life insurance company limited picc life a subsidiary of the people insurance company group of china limited picc group to form an agency distribution company in china products under consideration to be distributed by the joint venture company include jointly developed life and retirement insurance products existing picc life products picc property and casualty company limited picc p and c insurance products aig property casualty products as well as other products aimed at meeting the needs of this developing market we will own 24 9 percent of the joint venture company with picc life holding the remaining 75 1 percent our participation in the joint venture will be managed by aig property casualty the joint venture is planned to commence operations by the first quarter of 2014 subject to regulatory approval on june 6 2013 we also exercised rights to purchase shares in connection with the rights offering of picc p and c a subsidiary of the picc group for a purchase price of approximately 93 million immediately prior to and after the rights offering we owned 9 9 percent of the outstanding shares in picc p and c aig property casualty strategic initiatives and opportunities business mix shift continue shifting toward higher value business to increase profitability expand in attractive growth economies specifically in asia pacific central europe the middle east africa and latin america underwriting excellence enhance risk selection and pricing to earn returns commensurate to the risk assumed claims best practices implement improved claims practices and advanced technology to lower the loss ratio operating expense discipline apply operating expense discipline and increase efficiencies by taking full advantage of our global footprint capital efficiency

includes increased asset diversification and yield enhancement opportunities that meet our liquidity risk and return objectives capital efficiency we continue to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad based risk tolerance guidelines for our operating units implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends in addition we remain focused on enhancing our global reinsurance strategy to improve capital efficiency we continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency in the six months ended june 30 2013 we completed 19 legal entity and branch restructuring transactions we continue to implement restructuring plans in various jurisdictions our overall legal entity restructuring is expected to be mostly completed by the end of 2014 subject to regulatory approvals in those jurisdictions 86 item 2 executive overview on july 16 2013 we announced the planned merger of aiu insurance company ltd aiu and fuji fire and marine insurance company ltd ffm scheduled to take place in the second half of 2015 or later subject to regulatory approvals the merger is consistent with our growth strategy for the japan market and is intended to combine the expertise and experience of these companies to meet our customers and partners needs and provide products and services which will target higher levels of customer satisfaction in a cost effective manner we continued the strategy adopted in 2010 to improve the allocation of our reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets on july 9 2013 we entered into a five year catastrophe bond transaction which will provide 125 million of indemnity protection against u s caribbean and gulf of mexico named storms and u s and canadian earthquakes the transaction provides us with fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on a per occurrence basis through june 2018 in addition effective may 31 2013 we modified certain reinsurance arrangements from our japan entities to simplify operations and facilitate efficient capital allocation aig life and retirement outlook aig life and retirement businesses and the life and annuity industry continue to be affected by the current economic environment of low interest rates and volatile equity markets continued low interest rates put pressure on long term investment returns negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing products products such as payout annuities and traditional life insurance that are not rate adjustable may require increases in reserves if future investment yields fall to a level that results in expected future losses also low interest rates can affect the recoverability and accelerate the amortization of dac assets held with respect to our variable annuity fixed annuity and universal life businesses equity market volatility may result in higher reserves for variable annuity guarantee features and can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of dac assets aig life and retirement has implemented a number of actions to address the impact of low interest rates these actions include a disciplined approach to pricing new business related to interest sensitive products e g fixed annuities and active management of renewal crediting rates we have filed new life insurance and annuity products with reduced minimum rate guarantees although the low interest rate environment still persists the recent increase in interest rates has improved our outlook for our interest rate sensitive businesses an increase in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of our investment portfolio but rising interest rates will increase the rate earned on new investment purchases and over time should positively affect overall yields steadily increasing interest rates accompanied by a steepening in the yield curve are also favorable for fixed annuity sales as fixed annuities become more competitive in the marketplace compared to alternatives such as bank deposits in addition increases in interest rates will positively affect our retirement income solutions business results as increases in interest rates generally reduce the value of embedded derivative liabilities contained in guaranteed benefit features of variable annuities rapid and significant increases from current levels of interest rates however could result in elevated surrender activity in our interest rate sensitive products primarily fixed annuities with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates the extent of the increase in surrender activity if any will depend on the relationship of minimum guarantees embedded in certain in force contracts relative to the pace and extent of interest rate increases approximately 22 5 billion or 24 percent of our fixed annuity account values have minimum rate guarantees greater than 3 percent 87 item 2 executive overview aig life and retirement strategic initiatives and opportunities assets under management fully leverage a unified distribution organization to increase sales of profitable products across all channels capitalize on the growing demand for income solutions and on aig life and retirement capital base risk controls innovative product designs expanded distribution initiatives and financial discipline to grow the variable annuity business pursue selected institutional market opportunities where aig life and retirement scale and capital base provide a competitive advantage product innovation develop innovative life offerings through consumer focused research that delivers superior differentiated product solutions operational efficiencies consolidate life insurance and annuity platforms operations and administrative systems to create a more efficient cost competitive and agile operating model return on equity we completed the merger of six life insurance operating legal entities into american general life insurance company effective december 31 2012 we are leveraging our streamlined legal entity structure to enhance financial strength and durability more efficiently allocate capital and enhance the ease of doing business with us we have also made organizational changes to achieve greater operational leverage across our businesses investment strategy consistent with aig worldwide insurance investment policy aig life and retirement places primary emphasis on investments in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among others residential and commercial real estate commercial mortgage loans and to a lesser extent private equity hedge funds other alternative investments and common and preferred stocks our fundamental investment strategy is to maintain primarily a diversified high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities with the intent to match established duration targets based on the characteristics of our liabilities in addition we enhance our returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds hedge funds and affordable housing partnerships although these investments are subject to periodic volatility they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed income portfolio yields our expectation is that these alternative investments will continue to outperform the fixed income portfolio yields over the long term while providing important diversification to our investment portfolio we continue to make investments in structured securities and fixed income securities with attractive risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income overall our yields have been declining since the latter half of 2012 as investment purchases have been made at yields lower than the weighted average yield of the existing portfolio we would expect this trend to continue as long as reinvestment rates are below the weighted average yield of the investment portfolio although interest rates continue to be low relative to historic levels the recent increase in interest rates has improved our reinvestment outlook other operations outlook mortgage guaranty mortgage guaranty strategic initiatives and opportunities the improving u s mortgage market has resulted in increasing levels of mortgage originations house value appreciation and tight mortgage underwriting standards which combined with improving u s macroeconomic conditions have had a favorable impact on our operating results most notably on the volume and quality of new business written ugc is a leading provider of mortgage insurance and has differentiated itself from competitors through its risk based pricing strategy initiated in 2009 this pricing strategy provides ugc customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with underwriting risk which we believe has resulted in an appropriately priced high quality book of business ugc plans to continue to execute this strategy during the remainder of 2013 the new business generated since 2009 accounts for approximately 50 percent of net premiums earned for the six months ended june 30 2013 88 item 2 executive overview during the first half of 2013 low interest rates on mortgages resulted in increased refinancing activity these low rates along with housing price appreciation and an improvement in the overall economy have also resulted in increased home purchase activity if interest rates were to continue to rise in the future we would expect refinancing activities to decline however a decline could be offset by any increases in mortgage activity related to an increase in home sales additionally in a rising interest rate environment mortgage insurance is likely to see higher persistency generating revenue over longer periods in the future global capital markets aig markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between aig and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for aig entities the derivative portfolio of aig markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives the remaining derivatives portfolio of aig financial products corp and aig trading group inc and their respective subsidiaries collectively aigfp consists primarily of hedges of the assets and liabilities of the dib and a portion of the legacy hedges for aig and its subsidiaries aigfp derivatives portfolio consists primarily of interest rate currency credit commodity and equity derivatives additionally aigfp has a credit default swap portfolio being managed for economic benefit and with limited risk the aigfp portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with our risk management objectives although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility it consists predominantly of transactions that we believe are of low complexity low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis direct investment book the dib portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all its liabilities as they come due even under stress scenarios and to maximize return consistent with our risk management objectives we are focused on meeting the dib liquidity needs including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the dib without relying on resources beyond the dib as part of this program management we may from time to time access the capital markets including issuing and repurchasing debt and selling assets on an opportunistic basis in each case subject to market conditions from time to time we may utilize cash allocated to the dib that is not required to meet the risk target for general corporate purposes unrelated to the dib certain non derivative assets and liabilities of the dib are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility the overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the dib is executed by gcm the value of hedges related to the non derivative assets and liabilities of aigfp in the dib is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of gcm and is not included within the dib operating results assets or liabilities 89 table of contents item 2 results of operations results of operations the following section provides a comparative discussion of our results of operations

pre tax income from continuing operations was 13 4 percent and 18 7 percent respectively the effective tax rate for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2013 attributable to continuing

year loss ratio as adjusted improved due to the continued shift to higher value business enhanced risk selection and improved pricing aig life and retirement pre tax income increased in the three and

growth in our variable annuity account value continued active spread management related to our interest rate sensitive businesses and income from legal settlements this increase was partially offset by the absence in 2013 of the fair value gains on ml ii that were recognized in the prior year period net realized capital gains increased due to gains from sales activity in connection with utilizing

30 2013 respectively compared to the same periods in 2012 primarily due to the strong performance in alternative investments corporate debt securities continues to be our largest asset category we continued to reduce our concentration in lower yielding tax exempt municipal bond holdings and focus on risk weighted opportunistic investments in higher yielding assets such as structured securities this asset diversification has achieved an increase in average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity investments were largely unchanged we expect to continue to execute our investment strategy in 2013 to meet our liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives net investment income from investment categories other than debt securities increased by 180 million and 343 million in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2013 respectively compared to the same periods in 2012 in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2013 approximately 129 million and 256 million respectively were attributed to the strong performance of alternative investments following an approximate 2 percent and 18 percent

gains losses net realized capital gains in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2013 were driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities of 88 million and 159

six month periods ended june 30 2013 respectively net realized capital gains for the three month period ended june 30 2012 were primarily driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities in the amount of 165 million this was partially offset by other than temporary impairments of 96 million primarily attributable to publicly traded and privately held equity securities in the japan portfolios and a decrease in recoverable values for structured securities in addition impairment charges of 56 million related to life settlement contracts were recorded during the period 112 table of contents item 2 results of operations liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense net realized capital losses for the six month period ended june 30 2012 were primarily driven by other than temporary impairments of 299 million primarily attributable to a decrease in recoverable values for structured securities and partnership investments and equity securities in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months in addition impairment charges of 114 million related to life settlement contracts were recorded during the period these items were partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity securities of 329 million liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense the following discussion of the consolidated

unit which is reported in other operations the following table presents the components of aig gross loss reserves by major lines of business on a u s statutory basis data table removed presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners aig gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including estimates for ibnr and loss expenses less applicable discount for future investment income we regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in operating income because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase prior years estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease prior years estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance less applicable discount for future investment

discount benefit charge data table removed quarterly reserving conclusion aig net loss reserves represent our best estimate of our liability for net losses and loss expenses as of june 30 2013 while we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed our loss reserves as of june 30 2013 in our opinion such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves data table removed see tables

available to aig these reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the table above data table removed 115 table of contents item 2 results of operations liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense quarterly and year to date net loss development in determining the loss development from prior accident years we analyze and evaluate the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable as appropriate we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence as part of our reserving process we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues such as those related to the u s mortgage and housing market for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2013 the net adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in the commercial insurance operating segment and other that was partially offset by net favorable development in the consumer insurance operating segment the net adverse development in commercial insurance was primarily attributable to domestic property exposures mostly due to the increase in reserves for storm sandy and by adverse development in the primary casualty lines primarily from loss sensitive business that was entirely offset by additional premiums and higher than expected legal costs on claims for construction defects policies covering artisan contractors from accident years 2004 and prior the adverse development on those classes was partially offset by case reductions on some large claims and favorable development on other short lived classes the adverse development in other for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2013 included adverse development on legacy asbestos and environmental exposures 1986 and prior in addition the six month period ended june 30 2013 included adverse development on run off environmental exposures 1987 2003 the favorable development in consumer insurance was due to lower than expected losses in personal lines including decreases in reserves for storm sandy and non catastrophe losses for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2012 the net adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in commercial insurance and other which was partially offset by net favorable development in reserves in consumer insurance the net adverse development in commercial insurance was primarily attributable to the increase in reserves on large excess casualty cases primarily casualty and environmental business policies written after 1987 partially offset by favorable development in domestic property exposures and catastrophe losses the favorable development in consumer insurance was due to lower than expected losses on natural catastrophe losses in personal lines the adverse development in other included adverse development on run off environmental exposures 1987 2003 aig property casualty recognized additional premiums on loss sensitive business of 70 million and 80 million for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2013 respectively compared to returned premiums of 20 million and 14 million in the same periods in the prior

prior years catastrophes see aig property casualty results herein and other operations other operations results mortgage guaranty for further discussion of net loss development asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies

annuities and other products and lower net investment spreads as portfolio cash flows are reinvested at lower rates spread compression we have taken a number of actions to mitigate these impacts as discussed below aig life and retirement has addressed the impact of sustained low interest rates with a number of actions taken on both the asset and liability sides of our balance sheet opportunistic investment in structured securities to increase yields continued disciplined approach to new business pricing active management of renewal crediting rates re priced certain life insurance and annuity products to reflect current low rate environment re filed certain products to continue lowering minimum rate guarantees included product limits where appropriate to minimize exposure to low interest rates as a result of these actions we estimate that the effect of interest rates remaining at or near current levels through the end of 2013 on pre tax operating income would not be material and would be modestly more significant with respect to 2014 results in addition the recent increase in interest rates has improved our outlook for our interest rate sensitive businesses as a rising interest rate environment will increase the rate earned on new investment purchases and over time will positively affect overall yields steadily increasing interest rates accompanied by a steepening in the yield curve are also favorable for fixed annuity sales as fixed annuities become more competitive in the marketplace compared to alternatives such as bank deposits opportunistic investments the majority of assets backing insurance and annuity liabilities consist of intermediate and long term fixed maturity securities we generally purchase assets with the intent of matching expected maturities of the insurance liabilities an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability maturities from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses opportunistic investments in structured securities private placement corporate debt securities and commercial mortgage loans continue to be made to improve yields increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment disciplined new business pricing new fixed annuity sales have declined in the first six months of 2013 relative to the same period in 2012 due to the relatively low crediting rates offered as a result of our disciplined approach to new business however even in the current interest rate environment we continue to pursue new sales of life and annuity products at targeted net investment spreads new sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum 129 item 2 results of operations aig life and retirement interest rate guarantees of 1 percent universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non indexed products and 1 percent on new indexed products and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted net investment spreads active management of renewal crediting rates the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in our products may have the effect in a continued low interest rate environment of reducing our spreads and thus reducing future profitability although we partially mitigate this interest rate risk through our asset liability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability our annuity and universal life products were designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees we have adjusted and will continue to adjust crediting rates to maintain targeted net investment spreads on both new business and in force business where crediting rates are above minimum guarantees in addition to annuity and universal life products certain traditional long duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates such as payout annuities are exposed to reduced earnings and potential reserve increases in a prolonged low interest rate environment as indicated in the table below approximately 74 percent of our annuity and universal life account values are at their minimum crediting rates as of june 30 2013 an increase from 61 percent at december 31 2012 these products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of june 30 2013 ranging from 1 percent to 5 5 percent with the higher rates representing guarantees on older products data table removed effective product management aig life and retirement has a dynamic product management process designed to ensure that new business product offerings appropriately reflect the current low interest rate environment to the extent that we cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business products are re priced or no longer sold

entered into a new 625 million ascot corporate name limited acnl letter of credit facility which replaced the prior 725 million acnl letter of credit facility under the new facility aig parent replaced aig property casualty inc as a direct obligor acnl as a member of the lloyd of london insurance syndicate lloyd is required to hold capital at lloyd known as funds at lloyds fal under the new facility which supports the 2013 2014 and 2015 years of account the entire fal requirement of 564 million as of april 29 2013 was satisfied with a letter of credit issued under the facility aig life and retirement we expect that aig life and retirement subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events through cash from operations and to the extent necessary monetization of invested assets aig life and retirement subsidiaries liquidity resources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade fixed maturity securities these securities are eligible to be pledged to a fhlb in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations in the first six months of 2013 aig life and retirement provided 1 9 billion of liquidity to aig parent which was funded by the payment of dividends from aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries the need to fund product surrenders withdrawals and maturities creates a significant potential liquidity requirement for aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries we believe that because of the size and liquidity of our investment portfolios aig life and retirement does not face a significant liquidity risk due to normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience furthermore aig life and retirement products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk including surrender charges as part of its risk management framework aig life and retirement continues to evaluate and where appropriate pursue strategies and programs to improve its liquidity 145 item 2 liquidity and capital resources position and facilitate aig life and retirement ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio aig life and retirement also has developed a robust contingent liquidity plan to address any unforeseen liquidity needs aig life and retirement executes programs which began in 2012 that lend securities from its investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management under these programs aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries lend securities to financial institutions and receive collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities reinvestment of cash collateral received is restricted to liquid investments additionally the aggregate amount of securities that an aig life and retirement insurance company may lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account admitted assets aig life and retirement liability to the borrower for collateral received was 4 4 billion as of june 30 2013 in addition certain aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries are members of the fhlbs in their respective districts as of june 30 2013 aig life and retirement had outstanding borrowings of 50 million from the fhlbs borrowings from the fhlbs are used to supplement liquidity or for other general corporate purposes aig parent is party to cmas with certain aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries among other things the cmas provide that aig parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of each of these aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries at or above a specified minimum percentage of the subsidiary projected company action level rbc in addition the cmas provide that if the total adjusted capital of these aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries is in excess of that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level rbc subject to approval by their respective boards and compliance with applicable insurance laws the subsidiaries would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage as of june 30 2013 the specified minimum percentage was 385 percent except for the cma with agc life insurance company where the specified minimum percentage is 250 percent in the first six months of 2013 approximately 1 9 billion was distributed under the cmas and aig parent was not required to make any capital contributions under the cmas other operations mortgage guaranty we expect that mortgage guaranty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events through cash from operations and to the extent necessary monetization of invested assets mortgage guaranty liquidity resources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade fixed maturity securities these securities could be monetized in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations on july 1 2013 aig parent entered into a cma with a mortgage guaranty insurance subsidiary among other things the cma provides that aig parent will maintain capital and surplus of this mortgage guaranty insurance subsidiary at or above a specified minimum required capital based on a specified risk to capital ratio in addition the cma provides that if capital and surplus of this mortgage guaranty insurance subsidiary is in excess of that same specified minimum required capital subject to board approval and compliance with applicable insurance laws this mortgage guaranty insurance subsidiary would declare and pay ordinary dividends to its equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual capital and surplus to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum required capital as structured the cma contemplates that the specified minimum required capital would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually the initial specified minimum required capital is based on a risk to capital ratio of 21 to 1 global capital markets gcm acts as the derivatives intermediary between aig and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for aig entities commencing june 10 2013 gcm is required to clear certain derivatives transactions through central regulated clearing organizations pursuant to dodd frank to the extent a derivatives transaction is subject to a clearing obligation gcm is required to post collateral in amounts determined by the relevant clearing 146 item 2 liquidity and capital resources organization and gcm clearing agreements with its futures commission merchants to the extent a derivatives transaction is not subject to a clearing obligation these derivative trades are governed by bilateral master agreements the form of which is published by the international swaps and derivatives association inc isda these agreements primarily between gcm and third party financial institutions require collateral postings many of gcm transactions with aig and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements the purpose of which are to provide collateral to gcm which in turn is used to satisfy posting requirements with third parties including the margin requirements of clearing organizations and futures commission merchants most of gcm cds are subject to collateral posting provisions the collateral posting provisions contained in the isda agreements and related transaction documents with respect to cdss differ among counterparties and asset classes the amount of future collateral posting requirements for super senior cdss is a function of our credit ratings the rating of the relevant reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor we estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior cds using various methodologies the contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions as of june 30 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively gcm had total assets of 8 6 billion and 8 0 billion and total liabilities of 3 8 billion and 4 9 billion gcm assets consist primarily of cash short term investments other receivables net of allowance and unrealized gains on swaps options and forwards gcm liabilities consist primarily of trade payables and unrealized losses on swaps options and forwards collateral posted by gcm to third parties was 3 3 billion and 4 2 billion at june 30 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively gcm obtained collateral from third parties totaling 543 million and 846 million at june 30 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively the collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under master netting agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date direct investment book the dib is managed so that it maintains the liquidity that we believe is necessary to meet all of the dib liabilities as they come due even under stress scenarios without having to liquidate dib assets or rely on additional liquidity from aig parent if the dib risk target is breached we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the dib liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then prevailing market conditions any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by aig parent the dib assets consist primarily of cash short term investments fixed maturity securities issued by u s government and government sponsored entities mortgage and asset backed securities and to a lesser extent bank loans and mortgage loans the dib liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short term financing obligations as of june 30 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively the dib had total assets of 25 7 billion and 28 5 billion and total liabilities of 21 8 billion and 23 8 billion the overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the dib is executed by gcm the value of hedges related to the non derivative assets and liabilities of aigfp in the dib is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of gcm and are not included within the dib operating results assets or liabilities collateral posted by operations included in the dib to third parties was 4 3 billion at both june 30 2013 and december 31 2012 this collateral primarily consists of securities of the u s government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties credit facilities we maintain a committed revolving four year syndicated credit facility the four year facility as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes the four year facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit we currently expect to replace or extend the four year facility on or prior to its expiration in october 2016 although no assurance can be given that the four year facility will be replaced on favorable terms or at all the four year facility provides for 4 0 billion of unsecured revolving loans which includes a 2 0 billion letter of credit sublimit as of june 30 2013 a total of approximately 3 1 billion remains available under the four year facility of which approximately 1 1 billion remains available for letters of credit our ability to borrow under the four year facility is not contingent on our credit ratings however our ability to borrow under the four year facility 147 item 2 liquidity and capital resources is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal operating administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the four year facility these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the four year facility would restrict our access to the four year facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity we expect to borrow under the four year facility from time to time and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes contingent liquidity facilities aig parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to 500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes under this facility we have the unconditional right prior to december 15 2015 to issue up to 500 million in senior debt to the counterparty based on a put option agreement between aig parent and the counterparty our ability to borrow under this facility is not contingent on our credit ratings contractual obligations the

relate to aig life and retirement businesses these liabilities include various investment type products with contractually scheduled maturities including periodic payments of a term certain nature these liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations for these policies and contracts i we are currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event such as death or disability ii payments are conditional on survivorship or iii payment may occur due to a surrender or other non scheduled event out of our control we have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits these assumptions include mortality morbidity future lapse rates expenses investment returns and interest crediting rates offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in force policies due to the significance of the assumptions the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments the amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets we believe that aig life and retirement subsidiaries have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations these subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments in addition aig life and retirement businesses maintain significant levels of investment grade fixed maturity securities including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient we expect liquidity needs related to gic liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets loss reserves relate to the aig property casualty and the mortgage guaranty businesses and represent future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns due to the significance of the assumptions used the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments we believe that aig property casualty and mortgage guaranty subsidiaries maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations borrowings our borrowings

overview our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit the investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for aig property casualty aig life and retirement and aig parent including the dib the primary objectives are generation of investment income preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities market conditions our investments and investment strategies were affected by the following conditions in the second quarter of 2013 the federal reserve potential tapering of its quantitative easing bond purchase program led to a selloff in the bond market in june slowing growth in china and continued challenges in europe added to the uncertainty in the bond market although june ended seven months of positive performance in the domestic equity markets the second quarter performance was muted at approximately 2 percent u s equity markets reached record high levels during the quarter before retreating in the last half of june bond yields increased sharply during the second quarter of 2013 with the ten year u s treasury rates increasing 64 basis points to end the quarter at 2 49 percent in addition spreads on investment grade and high yield securities widened during the quarter the performance of the u s dollar relative to other currencies was mixed during the quarter as it strengthened 5 percent against the yen weakened 1 percent against the euro and was flat against the british pound investment strategies at the local operating unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market general market conditions liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification in the case of aig life and retirement as well as in the dib our fundamental investment strategy is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration to the extent practicable fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in aig property casualty historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk to meet the current risk return and tax objectives of aig property casualty cash flows from the investment portfolio and insurance operations are generally being reinvested by the domestic property and casualty companies in taxable instruments which meet the companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by aig property casualty companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate aig parent liquidity resources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade fixed maturity securities aig parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and tenor during the first half of 2013 upon an assessment of its immediate and longer term funding needs aig parent purchased publicly traded intermediate term investment grade fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity 155 item 2 investments investment highlights the following is an overview of investment activities during the second quarter of 2013 an increase in rates and widening of investment grade and high yields spreads resulted in net unrealized losses in the investment portfolio net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio declined to approximately 14 billion as of june 30 2013 from approximately 25 billion as of december 31 2012 due to increases in interest rates and the realization of over 1 5 billion in gains we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities with attractive and appropriate risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income net investment income benefited from higher returns on alternative investments primarily due to the performance of equity markets blended investment yields on new aig life and retirement and aig property casualty investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called other than temporary impairments remained at low levels with a small portion attributable to structured securities credit ratings at june 30 2013 approximately 89 percent of fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities approximately 17 percent of such securities were rated aaa by one or more of the principal rating agencies and approximately 15 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings third party rating services ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis a significant portion of our foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by moody s and p or similar foreign rating services rating services are not available for some foreign issued securities our credit risk management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio non rated fixed maturity securities at june 30 2013 approximately 16 percent of such investments were either rated aaa or on the basis of our internal analysis were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated aaa and approximately 3 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated approximately 49 percent of the foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity

by reportable segment data table removed at june 30 2013 approximately 89 percent and 11 percent of investments were held by domestic and foreign entities respectively compared to approximately 88 percent and 12 percent respectively at december 31 2012 aig property casualty in our property casualty business the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than that for other lines as differentiated from the life insurance and retirement services companies the focus is not on asset liability matching but on preservation of capital and growth of surplus fixed maturity securities of aig property casualty domestic operations with an average duration of 4 1 years are currently comprised primarily of tax exempt securities which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds government and agency bonds and corporate bonds the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings 158 table of contents item 2 investments fixed maturity securities held in aig property casualty foreign operations are of high quality and short to intermediate duration averaging 4 2 years while invested assets backing reserves are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities in aig property casualty domestic operations a modest portion of surplus is allocated to alternative investments including private equity and hedge funds these investments have provided a combination of added diversification and attractive long term returns over time aig life and retirement with respect to aig life and retirement we use asset liability management as a tool to determine the composition of the invested assets our objective is to maintain a matched asset liability structure although we may occasionally determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position to the extent that we have maintained a matched asset liability structure the economic effect of interest rate fluctuations is partially mitigated our investment strategy for aig life and retirement is to produce cash flows greater than maturing insurance liabilities there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities aig life and retirement frequently reviews its interest rate assumptions and actively manages the crediting rates used for its new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a low interest rate environment the investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity a number of guaranteed benefits such as living benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits are offered on certain variable and indexed annuity products the fair value of these benefits is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts we manage our exposure resulting from these long term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments we actively review underlying assumptions of policyholder behavior and persistency related to these guarantees we have taken positions in certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the impact of changes in equity markets and interest rates on these benefit guarantees we execute listed futures and options contracts on equity indexes to hedge certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuity products we also enter into various types of futures and options contracts primarily to hedge changes in value of certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuities due to fluctuations in interest rates we use several instruments to hedge interest rate exposure including listed futures on government securities listed options on government securities and the purchase of government securities with respect to over the counter derivatives we deal with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts we have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically we generally use isda master agreements and credit support annexes csas with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures fixed maturity securities of aig life and retirement with an average duration of 6 2 years are comprised of taxable corporate bonds as well as municipal and government bonds commercial mortgage loans and agency and non agency structured securities the majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on our composite ratings naic designations the svo

recoverables collateral extended to counterparties mostly pursuant to derivative transactions derivatives and captive fronting risk management programs for these financial institutions european concentrations we actively monitor our european credit exposures especially those exposures to issuers in the euro zone periphery we use various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine the need for mitigating actions as a mitigating action we typically decide not to renew maturing exposures or when the opportunity presents itself to sell or to tender securities to date we have not actively used credit default protection we periodically evaluate the financial condition of issuers and adjust internal risk ratings as warranted the result of these continuing reviews has led us to believe that our combined credit risk exposures in the euro zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers 173 item 2 enterprise risk management the following table presents our aggregate united kingdom and european credit exposures excluding ilfc by major sector data table

exposures were to the united kingdom and bermuda we regularly review concentration reports in the categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings and credit spreads we periodically adjust limits and review exposures for risk mitigation to provide reasonable assurance that we do not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that our credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units market risk management market risk is defined as the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies equity and commodity prices and their levels of volatility market risk includes credit spread risk the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in credit spreads of securities or counterparties we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance businesses and gcm in our insurance operations market risk results primarily from potential mismatches in our asset liability exposures rather than speculative positioning specifically our life insurance and retirement businesses collect premiums or deposits from policyholders and invest the proceeds in predominantly long term fixed maturity securities we earn a spread between the asset yield and the cost payable to policyholders we manage the business so that the cash flows from invested assets are sufficient to meet policyholder obligations when they become due without the need to sell assets prematurely into a potentially distressed market in periods of severe market volatility depressed and illiquid fair values on otherwise performing investments diminish shareholders equity even without actual credit event related losses 176 item 2 enterprise risk management our market exposures can be categorized as follows benchmark interest rates benchmark interest rates are also known as risk free interest rates and are associated with either the government treasury yield curve or the swap curve the fair value of our significant fixed maturity securities portfolio changes as benchmark interest rates change credit spread or risk premium credit spread risk is the potential for loss due to a change in an instrument risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration default free instrument equity and alternative investment prices we are exposed to equity and alternative investment prices affecting a variety of instruments these include direct investments in common stock and mutual funds minimum benefit guarantees embedded in the structure of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance products and other equity like investments such as hedge funds and private equity funds private equity investments commercial real estate and real estate funds foreign currency exchange rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income assets and liabilities denominated in and significant capital deployed in a variety of currencies we use a number of measures and approaches to measure and quantify our market risk exposure including duration key rate duration duration is the measure of the sensitivities of a fixed income instrument to the changes in the benchmark yield curve key rate duration measures sensitivities to the movement at a given term point on the yield curve scenario analysis scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forward looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 10 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world wide equity markets stress testing stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of rmbs or cmbs during 2008 var value at risk var is a summary statistical measure that uses the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors and a management determined level of confidence to estimate how frequently a portfolio of risk exposures could be expected to lose at least a specified amount as an example federal reserve market risk measure specifies a var based approach to calculate market risk equivalent assets for capital ratio calculations insurance operations portfolio sensitivities the following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed exposures to yield curve movements include fixed maturity securities loans finance receivables and short term investments but exclude consolidated separate account assets total yield sensitive assets decreased 4 9 percent or 177 item 2 enterprise risk management approximately 15 1 billion compared to december 31 2012 primarily due to a net decrease in fixed income securities and other fixed assets of 12 3 billion and a decrease in cash equivalents of 2 8 billion exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stock preferred stocks mutual funds hedge funds private equity funds commercial real estate and real estate funds but exclude consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds total exposure in these areas increased 0 5 percent or approximately 123 million compared to december 31 2012 primarily due to an increase of 239 million related to alternative investments and an increase in common equity securities of 37 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other equity investments of 59 million a decrease in real estate investments of 57 million and decrease in mutual fund value of 37 million exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect our consolidated non u s dollar net capital investments on a gaap basis foreign currency exchange rates net exposure increased 6 2 percent or 563 million compared to december 31 2012 this was primarily due to an increase in hong kong dollar exposure of 592 million resulting from aig life and retirement investment in picc group an increase in euro exposure of 101 million resulting from a reduction in euro denominated debt outstanding and a net increase across other currencies of 259 million the increase was partially offset by a decrease in euro exposure of 202 million at aig europe limited a decrease in british pound exposure of 108 million resulting from british pound exchange rate decreasing and a decrease in canadian dollar exposure of 108 million resulting from a dividend payment from chartis insurance company of canada for illustrative purposes we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u s dollar this should not be taken as a prediction but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short term cash collateral or other financial obligations the failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in reduced operating flexibility increased costs and reputational harm because liquidity is critically important our liquidity governance includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address both aig specific broader industry and market related liquidity events sources of liquidity risk can include but are not limited to financial market movements significant changes in interest rates can provide incentives for policyholders to surrender their policies changes in markets can impact collateral posting requirements or limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs due to unfavorable market conditions inadequate market depth or other investors seeking to sell the same or similar assets potential reputational events or credit downgrade changes can have an impact on policyholder cancellations and withdrawals or impact collateral posting requirements and catastrophic events including natural and man made disasters that can increase policyholder claims the principal objective of erm liquidity risk framework is to protect aig liquidity position and identify a diversity of funding sources available to meet actual and contingent liabilities during both normal and stress periods we defined our risk appetite to include a liquidity target aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a two year time horizon designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions if we project that we will breach the tolerance we will assess and determine the appropriate liquidity management actions however the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements additionally each business unit is responsible for managing liquidity within a framework designed for the measurement and monitoring of liquidity risks inherent in that business current cash and liquidity positions are reviewed for changes and against minimum liquidity levels future cash inflows and outflows are tracked through cash flow forecasting if the business unit projects a breach of the minimum liquidity levels the amount of required liquidity resources will be identified and we will determine any actions to be taken business unit level key indicators are assessed to provide advance warning of potential liquidity risks 178 table of contents item 2 critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment the accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions which are critical accounting estimates are related to the determination of classification of ilfc as held for sale insurance liabilities including property casualty and mortgage guaranty unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts income tax assets and liabilities including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset recoverability of assets including reinsurance assets estimated gross profits for investment oriented products other than temporary impairments of financial instruments liabilities for legal contingencies and fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities see note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters that may be highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected the following discussion updates critical accounting estimates included in the 2012 annual report for a complete discussion of aig critical accounting estimates you should read this section in conjunction with part ii item 7 md and a critical accounting estimates in the 2012 annual report classification of ilfc as held for sale we report a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan the business is available for immediate sale the business is being actively marketed the sale is anticipated to occur during the next 12 months which may require significant judgment and certain other specified criteria are met a business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell if the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value a loss is recognized on december 9 2012 american international group inc aig parent aig capital corporation seller a wholly

closing of the ilfc transaction has not occurred aig continues to consider ilfc as a non core business and is continuing to pursue other options including a sale or initial public offering we determined ilfc met the criteria for held for sale and discontinued operations accounting at june 30 2013 and december 31 2012 recoverability of net deferred tax asset the evaluation of the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed we consider a number of factors in order to reliably estimate future taxable income so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses nols foreign tax credits ftcs and nonlife capital loss carryforwards these factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and aig specific conditions and events we also subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization we also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies our income forecasts coupled with our tax planning strategies and stress scenarios all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the tax attributes other than life insurance business capital loss carryforwards prior to their expiration our ability to utilize capital loss carryforwards in aig life and retirement depends in part on our ability to sell fixed maturity securities in a gain position changes in market conditions including interest rates rising in excess of our projections may result in a reduction in projected taxable gains and reestablishment of a valuation allowance see note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of aig framework for assessing the

inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment we classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation including contractual terms prices and rates yield curves credit curves measures of volatility prepayment

changes in how financial companies particularly sifis should be regulated these frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision capital and solvency standards systemic economic risk corporate governance including compensation and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis the fsb has directed the international association of insurance supervisors the iais headquartered in basel switzerland to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body insurance core principles icps iais icps form the baseline threshold against which countries financial services regulatory efforts in the insurance sector are measured that measurement is made by periodic financial sector assessment program fsap reviews conducted by the world bank and the international monetary fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country specific additional or amended regulatory changes lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the financial services agency in japan financial and banking regulation adopted in france and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in germany and the united kingdom prudential regulation authority the fsb has also charged the iais with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups the iais has requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine which elements of the insurance sector if any could materially and adversely impact other parts of the global financial services sector e g commercial and investment banking securities trading etc the iais has provided its assessment template to the fsb based on this assessment template on july 18 2013 the fsb in consultation with the iais and national 183 item 2 regulatory environment authorities identified an initial list of global systemically important

internationally active insurance groups iaigs which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its icps but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of iaigs as currently delineated under the comframe aig meets the parameters set forth to define an iaig while we currently do not know when any comframe directives will be finalized and become effective the iais will undertake a field testing of the comframe including the possibility of additional capital requirements for iaigs which is expected to commence in the latter part of 2013 it is expected that the comframe would be fully implemented by 2018 legislation in the european union could also affect our international insurance operations the solvency ii directive 2009 138 eec solvency ii which was adopted on november 25 2009 and is expected to become effective in 2016 reforms the insurance industry solvency framework including minimum capital and solvency requirements governance requirements risk management and public reporting standards the impact on us will depend on whether the u s insurance regulatory regime is deemed equivalent to solvency ii if the u s insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent then we along with other insurance companies could be required to be supervised under solvency ii standards whether the u s insurance regulatory regime will be deemed equivalent is still under consideration by european authorities and remains uncertain so we are not currently able to predict the impact of solvency ii we expect that the regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future 184 table of contents item 2 glossary glossary accident year the annual
