table removed 72 aig third quarter 2019 form 10 q item 2 use of non gaap measures use of non gaap measures throughout this md and a we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results some of the measurements we use are non gaap financial measures under securities and exchange commission rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the non gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and book value per common share excluding aoci and deferred tax assets dta adjusted book value per common share are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per common share basis we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig common shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig common shareholders equity excluding aoci and dta adjusted common shareholders equity by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a return on common equity adjusted after tax income excluding aoci and dta adjusted return on common equity is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders equity we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on common equity adjusted return on common equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after tax income attributable to aig common shareholders by average adjusted common shareholders equity the reconciliation to return on common equity the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a adjusted after tax income attributable to aig common shareholders is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre tax income apti adjustments described below dividends on preferred stock and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance and net tax charge related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act and by excluding the net realized capital gains losses from noncontrolling interests we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the consolidated results of operations section of this md and a adjusted revenues exclude net realized capital gains losses income from non operating litigation settlements included in other income for gaap purposes and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits included in net investment income for gaap purposes adjusted revenues is a gaap measure for our operating segments aig third quarter 2019 form 10 q 73 item 2 use of non gaap measures adjusted pre tax income is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax this definition is consistent across our segments these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions and measures that we believe to be common to the industry apti is a gaap measure for our segments excluded items include the following data table removed general insurance ratios we along with most property and casualty insurance companies use the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses which for general insurance excludes net loss reserve discount and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting natural and man made catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on aig in excess of 10 million each and also include certain man made events such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the 10 million threshold we believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of managements control we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results life and retirement premiums and deposits includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies group benefit policies and life contingent payout annuities as well as deposits received on universal life investment type annuity

business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates currency exchange rates credit and equity market conditions catastrophic claims events regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continued to operate under difficult market conditions in the first nine months of 2019 characterized by factors such as the impact of historically low interest rates uncertainties in the annuity marketplace resulting from legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at re evaluating the standard of care for sales of investment products and services slowing global economic growth global trade tensions and the uks pending withdrawal from its membership in the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has also affected the u s dollar british pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro british pound and the japanese yen the major currencies which may continue for some time impact of changes in the interest rate environment while many benchmark u s interest rates had risen to recent period highs in 2018 more recent concerns about weakness in u s economic expansion have led to declining interest rates over the first nine months of 2019 with key benchmark rates in the u s and in many developed markets close to historic lows and in some international jurisdictions negative the low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios on the other hand if rates rise some of these impacts may abate while there may be different impacts some of which are highlighted below we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset liability management including spread management strategies for our investment oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities additionally sustained low interest rates may result in higher pension expense due to the impact on discounting of projected benefit cash flows annuity sales and surrenders the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on investment returns which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products however our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales but may also drive higher surrenders customers are however currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment in addition older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio we will closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for annuities with guaranteed income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets including the level of interest rates credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment a low interest rate environment puts margin pressure on pricing of new business and on existing products due to the challenge of investing new money or recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low interest rate environment in addition there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in force business specifically the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset liability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability for additional information on our investment and asset liability management strategies see investments 82 aig third quarter 2019 form 10 q item 2 executive summary for investment oriented products in our individual retirement group retirement life insurance and institutional markets businesses our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads using asset liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees we will continue to adjust crediting rates on in force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment contractual minimum crediting rates and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre established intervals as interest rates rise we may need to raise crediting rates on in force business for competitive and other reasons potentially reducing the impact of investing in a higher interest rate environment of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products 64 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at september 30 2019 the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 62 percent and 66 percent at september 30 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively these businesses continue to focus on

summary general insurance the impact of low interest rates on our general insurance segment is primarily on our long tail casualty line of business we expect limited impacts on our existing long tail casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities sustained low interest rates would potentially impact new and renewal business for the long tail casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates however we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection in addition for our general insurance segment and general insurance run off lines reported within the legacy portfolio sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers compensation and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves standard of care developments the sec federal and state lawmakers and state insurance regulators continue their efforts at evaluating what is an appropriate regulatory framework around a standard of care for the sale of investment products and services with the sec having recently adopted in june 2019 a set of final rules and interpretations on this topic that include regulation best interest on july 17 2018 the new york state department of financial services adopted a best interest standard of care regulation applicable to annuity and life transactions through issuance of the first amendment to insurance regulation 187 suitability and best interests in life insurance and annuity transactions regulation 187 the compliance date for regulation 187 was august 1 2019 for annuity products and will be february 1 2020 for life products as amended regulation 187 requires producers to act in their clients best interest when making point of sale and in force recommendations and provide in writing the basis for the recommendation as well as the facts and analysis to support the recommendation the amended regulation also imposes additional duties on life insurance companies in relation to these transactions such as requiring insurers to establish and maintain procedures designed to prevent financial exploitation and abuse we will implement and enhance processes and procedures where needed to comply with this regulation additionally on june 5 2019 the sec adopted a package of final rulemakings and interpretations which include regulation best interest regulation bi and the creation of a new disclosure tool called form crs relationship summary form crs regulation bi establishes new rules regarding the standard of care a broker must meet when making a recommendation to a retail customer in connection with the sale of a security or other covered recommendation form crs requires enhanced disclosure by broker dealers and investment advisors regarding client relationships and certain conflicts of interest issues the compliance date for regulation bi and form crs is june 30 2020 at the same time the sec issued two interpretations under the investment advisers act of 1940 the first addressed the standard of conduct applicable to sec registered investment advisors including details regarding the fiduciary duty owed to clients required disclosures and the advisors continuous monitoring obligations the second interpretation clarified when investment advice would be considered solely incidental to brokerage activity for purposes of the broker dealer exclusion from sec investment advisor registration these two sec interpretations became final upon publication we expect that the sec will continue to release guidance regarding these final rules and will further clarify its interpretations through the issuance of faqs and other publications we are evaluating the scope and full impact of this package of final rulemakings and interpretations on us and our customers distribution partners and financial advisors while preparing for compliance with them we will implement and enhance processes and procedures where needed to comply with the final rules and interpretations other states such as nevada new jersey and massachusetts have also proposed similar standard of care regulations applicable to insurance producers and or insurance companies additionally the naic is expected to complete its revisions to the naic suitability in annuity transactions model regulation later this year in regards to the standard of care that would be applicable in a sale or recommendation of an annuity we continue to closely follow these efforts and other relevant federal and state level regulatory and legislative developments in this area while we cannot predict the long term impact of these developments on our life and retirement businesses we believe our diverse product

investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk compared to return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income we experienced higher investment returns in our alternative investments portfolio due to robust equity market returns in the nine month period ended september 30 2019 income from an initial public offering of a holding in the private equity portfolio and an increase in income from fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option was elected this compares

level and involve considerations that include local and general market conditions duration and cash flow management risk appetite and volatility constraints rating agency and regulatory capital considerations tax and legal investment limitations some of our key investment strategies are as follows our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments that have similar characteristics with respect to the insurance liabilities they are associated with to the extent practicable this includes considerations for cash flow variability as a function of changes in various factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity markets and inflation we seek to originate investments that offer enhanced yield through liquidity premiums such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans which also add portfolio diversification these assets typically afford credit protections through covenants ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs and deeper due diligence given information access given our global presence we have access to assets that provide diversification from local markets to the extent we purchase these investments we generally hedge the currency risk using derivatives which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk adjusted returns compared to risk assets in the functional currency aig parent included in other operations actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and duration aig parents liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer term funding needs aig parent purchases publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity aig third quarter 2019 form 10 q 127 item 2 investments within the us the life and retirement and general insurance investments are generally split between reserve backing and surplus portfolios insurance reserves are backed by mainly investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our current risk return tax liquidity credit quality and diversification objectives we assess fixed maturity asset classes based on their fundamental risk including credit public and private commercial mortgages and residential mortgages regardless of whether such investments are bonds loans or structured products surplus accounts seek to enhance portfolio returns through a mix of fixed maturity investment grade and high yield and various alternative asset classes including private equity real estate equity and hedge funds over the past few years hedge fund investments have been reduced with more emphasis given to private equity real estate and leveraged capital for example we are currently focused on purchasing directly originated middle market loans with strong covenant packages outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by insurance companies consist primarily of high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate asset liability management the investment strategy within the general insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus maintenance of sufficient liquidity for unanticipated insurance claims and preservation of capital assets with varying degrees of liquidity and volatility are allocated based on whether backing reserves required surplus or excess surplus subject to capital liquidity and regulatory constraints general insurance invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies domestic operations have an average duration of 3 5 years fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies foreign operations have an average duration of 3 6 years while invested assets backing reserves of the general insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional liquid fixed maturity securities we have continued to allocate to asset classes that offer higher yields through structural and liquidity premiums particularly in the domestic operations in addition we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset backed investments to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates and inflation we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes sectors and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks in addition a portion of the surplus of general insurance is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments which seek to balance liquidity volatility and growth there is a higher allocation to equity oriented investments in general insurance relative to other aig portfolios given the underlying inflation risks inherent in that business although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio the investment strategy of the life and retirement companies is to provide net investment income to back liabilities that result in stable distributable earnings and enhance portfolio value for surplus accounts subject to asset liability management capital and regulatory constraints the life and retirement companies use asset liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses the life and retirement companies maintain a diversified high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans that to the extent practicable match the duration characteristics of the liabilities the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities and as a result duration varies between distinct portfolios the interest rate environment has a direct impact on the asset liability management profile of the businesses and an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio a further lengthening of the portfolio will be assessed in the context of available market opportunities as longer duration markets may not provide similar diversification benefits as shorter markets fixed maturity securities of the life and retirement companies domestic operations have an average duration of 7 9 years we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset class sectors and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks in addition the life and retirement companies seek to enhance surplus portfolio returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields 128 aig third quarter 2019 form 10 q item 2 investments naic designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office svo of the national association of insurance

annually estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment related returns and spreads product related fees and expenses mortality gains and losses policyholder behavior and other factors in estimating future gross profits lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on dac amortization if the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly dac and related reserves are recalculated using the new projections and any resulting adjustment is included in income updating such projections may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products the life insurance companies also review assumptions related to their respective gmwb living benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value the fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions including policyholder behavior as well as capital market assumptions various assumptions were updated including the following effective september 30 2019 we increased our reversion to the mean rates of return gross of fees to 3 62 percent from 2 92 percent for the variable annuity product line in individual retirement and to 3 29 percent from 1 90 percent for the variable annuity product line in group retirement primarily due to the recent rise in equity market growth our separate account long term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance remained unchanged at 7 0 percent and our ultimate projected yields on invested assets changed on most annuity deposits with some increasing by up to 9 basis points and others decreasing by up to 34 basis points and lowered by up to 40 basis points on some life insurance deposits projected yields are graded from a weighted average net gaap book yield of existing assets supporting the business based on the value of the assets to a weighted average yield based on the duration of the assets excluding assets that mature during the grading period the grading period is three years for deferred annuity products and five years for life insurance products due to deferred annuities

are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates equity prices credit spreads market volatility policyholder behavior and other factors in addition to risk mitigating features in our variable annuity product design we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb including exposures to changes in interest rates equity prices credit spreads and volatility the hedging program utilizes derivative instruments including but not limited to equity options futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see enterprise risk management insurance risks life and retirement companies key risks variable annuity risk management and hedging programs in our 2018 annual report 146 aig third quarter 2019 form 10 q item 2 insurance reserves differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders the economic hedge target differs from the u s gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivatives primarily due to the following the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations the u s gaap valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for u s gaap valuation such as margins for policyholder behavior mortality and volatility and the economic hedge target excludes the non performance or own credit risk adjustment used in the u s gaap valuation which reflects a market participants view of our claims paying ability by incorporating an additional spread the npa spread to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows because the discount rate includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margins the u s gaap valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors and to changes from actuarial assumption updates than the economic hedge target for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program the life and retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns which may be either positive or negative realized volatility versus implied volatility actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging particularly policyholder behavior and risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge the following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the u s gaap embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target data table removed impact on pre tax income loss the impact on our pre tax income loss of the variable annuity guaranteed living

are excluded from adjusted pre tax income of individual retirement and group retirement the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target the u s gaap embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio as discussed above when corporate credit spreads widen the change in the npa spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a gain and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a loss in addition to changes driven by credit market related movements in the npa spread the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits aig third quarter 2019 form

hedging portfolio in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2018 in the nine month period ended september 30 2018 fair value gains on embedded derivatives excluding npa and actuarial assumption update was fully offset by fair value losses on the related hedging portfolio fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a u s gaap basis due to the npa and other risk margins used for u s gaap valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge
