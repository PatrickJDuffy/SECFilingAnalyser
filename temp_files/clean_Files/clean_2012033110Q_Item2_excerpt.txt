to make progress on all of these efforts in 2012 business environment low interest rates and equity market volatility sunamerica businesses and the life and annuity industry continue to be affected by the current economic environment of low interest rates and equity market volatility equity market volatility may result in higher reserves for variable annuity guarantee features and both equity market volatility and low interest rates can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of deferred acquisition costs continued low interest rates put pressure on long term investment returns negatively affect future sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits future investment returns products such as payout annuities and traditional life insurance that are not rate adjustable may require increases in reserves if changes in estimates of future investment returns result in projected future losses sunamerica would not expect in 2012 a dac unlocking or increase in reserves due to loss recognition solely as a result of the low interest rate environment however because of the long term nature of certain contracts for which reserving assumptions are established upon issuance of the contracts small changes in certain of the original assumptions particularly estimates of future invested asset returns may cause large changes in the amount of reserve adequacy the sale of securities in unrealized gain positions that support certain payout annuity products and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields triggered loss recognition of 87 million in the first quarter of 2012 additional sales of such securities are contemplated in 2012 which could result in additional loss recognition or reserve increases in future periods see results

various distribution partners including sunamerica largest pre financial crisis variable annuity distribution partner resumed sales of sunamerica products during 2011 as a result of broader distribution opportunities sunamerica expects variable annuity sales to remain strong in 2012 sunamerica has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities contained in certain variable annuity contracts caused by changes in the equity markets interest rates and market implied volatilities sunamerica substantially hedges its exposure to equity markets however due to regulatory capital considerations a significant portion of the interest rate exposure is unhedged in the first quarter of 2012 sunamerica began purchasing u s treasury notes as a capital efficient strategy to reduce this interest rate risk exposure over time in amortizing dac value of business acquired voba and sales inducement assets sia sunamerica uses a reversion to mean methodology to account for fluctuations in separate account returns for its variable annuity business favorable separate account returns could trigger a favorable unlocking where the reversion to mean assumption is reset if current favorable equity market returns continue in 2012 such an unlocking could occur later in 2012 such positive unlocking is not expected to be significant to sunamerica operating results but could result in higher amortization amounts in future periods fixed annuities changes in the interest rate environment affect the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products if the low interest rate environment continues sunamerica expects fixed annuities sales including deposits into fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets to continue to be below 2011 levels for the remainder of 2012 life insurance sunamerica strategic focus for mortality based products includes disciplined underwriting active expense management and product innovation sunamerica distribution strategy is to grow new sales by strengthening the core retail independent and career agent distributor channels expanding its market presence to additional channels and niche markets and making investments in enhanced service technology sunamerica retail life sales continued to show strong growth increasing 7 percent during the first three months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 term life sales have increased while the economic environment has put pressure on the sales of universal life products which typically have higher annual premiums than term products and also offer additional features the direct to consumer channel has proven effective for the distribution of term life policies and a and h products and provides opportunities to bring innovative product solutions to the market that take advantage of new underwriting technologies sales of sunamerica term life policies through its affiliated matrix direct channel in the first quarter of 2012 were up more than 50 percent compared to the same period in 2011 due in part to the shift toward

have the effect in a continued low interest rate environment of reducing sunamerica spreads and thus reducing future profitability sunamerica partially mitigates this interest rate risk through its asset liability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a prolonged low interest rate environment may nevertheless negatively affect spreads on interest sensitive business as of march 31 2012 the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities consisted of intermediate and long term fixed maturity securities sunamerica generally purchases assets with the intent of matching expected maturities of the insurance liabilities an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of maturities from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses opportunistic investments in structured securities continue to be made to improve yields increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment sunamerica annuity and universal life products were designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be re set at pre established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees therefore on new business currently written as well as on in force business above minimum guarantees sunamerica has adjusted and will continue to adjust crediting rates in order to maintain targeted interest rate spreads new fixed annuity sales have declined in the first quarter of 2012 relative to the same period in the prior year as consumers appeared reluctant to purchase such annuities at the relatively lower crediting rates offered however even in the current interest rate environment sunamerica continues to pursue new sales at targeted interest rate spreads these annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees at 1 percent universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non indexed products and 1 percent on new indexed products and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted interest spreads when considering the returns of invested proceeds as a result of these actions sunamerica estimates that if interest rates remain at or near current levels through the end of 2013 full year 2012 and 2013 pre tax operating income will not be materially impacted as indicated in the table below approximately 51 percent of sunamerica annuity and universal life account values are at their minimum crediting rates as of march 31 2012 these products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of march 31 2012

of ugc request coverage will be cancelled foreclosure moratoriums the state attorneys general investigations into lenders foreclosure practices and new financial regulations initiated in 2010 have

average payments many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aig determination of its reserves is not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis

operating income in 2012 compared to 2011 reflecting higher net investment income lower dac amortization and lower policyholder benefit expense in sunamerica variable annuity business due to stronger equity market conditions and 43 million of additional dac amortization in 2011 as a result of an unlocking these increases were partially offset by less favorable mortality experience in 2012 the increase in net investment income reflected an increase in base yields of 46 basis points due to the reinvestment of significant amounts of cash and short term investments during 2011 together with continued active crediting rate management this resulted in higher base spreads across all of sunamerica spread based annuity businesses in addition to the increase from reinvestment net investment income compared to the same quarter of 2011 reflected the following items 131 million decrease in income from private equity funds and hedge funds due to lower returns 22 million decrease in call and tender income and income from fair value gain on ml ii of 246 million in the first quarter of 2012 was comparable to 251 million in the first quarter of 2011 in march 2012 sunamerica received a distribution of 1 6 billion from the sale by the frbny of the securities held by ml ii which resulted in the full liquidation by the frbny of this investment in a weak equity market sunamerica increases policyholder benefit reserves to recognize the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected account balance for certain guaranteed benefits features of variable annuities dac related to these products may also be adjusted through amortization expense to reflect updates of future estimated gross profits due to changes in equity market assumptions the effect of short term fluctuations in the equity markets on the estimated gross profits of variable products is mitigated in part through the use of a reversion to mean methodology for estimating future gross profits under this methodology sunamerica assumes a long term growth rate for the assets backing these liabilities which factors in potential short term fluctuations in the financial markets and if the long term growth rate assumption is deemed to be unreasonable in light of the current market conditions the long term growth rate assumption is revised upward or downward to reflect the revised estimate sunamerica did not make any changes to its long term growth rate assumptions in 2011 or 2012 the effect of positive equity market performance resulted in 52 million lower dac amortization and policyholder benefit expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 pre tax income for sunamerica included a 246 million increase in net realized capital losses due to higher other than temporary impairments and higher fair value losses on variable annuity embedded derivatives due to declining credit spreads partially offset by higher gains from the sale of investments the sale of securities in unrealized gain positions that support certain payout annuity products and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields triggered loss recognition of 87 million in the first quarter of 2012 which was reported as a component of benefit of dac voba sia and adjustments to reserves related to net realized capital losses these sales effectively shifted some future investment margins to

has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of embedded policy derivative liabilities contained in certain variable annuity contracts caused by changes in the equity markets interest rates and market implied volatilities sunamerica substantially hedges its exposure to equity markets however due to regulatory capital considerations a significant portion of the interest rate exposure is unhedged in the first quarter of 2012 sunamerica began purchasing u s treasury notes as a capital efficient strategy to reduce

rates currently offered group retirement deposits which include deposits into fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets increased primarily due to higher levels of individual rollover deposits in 2012 sunamerica expects that the low interest rate environment will begin to impact group retirement deposits resulting in lower levels of deposits into fixed options over the course of 2012 individual variable annuity deposits increased due to competitive product enhancements and reinstatements during the last year at a number of key broker dealers deposits from life insurance products increased in 2012 but were more than offset by declines in deferred annuities sold through life insurance distribution channels retail mutual fund annual sales growth was

part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities aig considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities for most security types supported by real estate related assets current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities this is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors in addition for floating rate securities persistently low libor levels continue to make these securities less attractive aig believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral based securities low contractual coupons and

materially higher than illustrated the sensitivity factors are the same as those used in the 2011 annual report on form 10 k critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment aig considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of estimates with respect to income taxes including recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax planning strategies and operating profitability of the character necessary for their realization recoverability of assets including deferred policy acquisition costs dac flight equipment and reinsurance insurance liabilities including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts estimated gross profits for investment oriented products impairment charges including other than temporary impairments on financial instruments and goodwill impairments liabilities for legal contingencies and fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities including cds and aig equity interest in ml iii these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used aig financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected the following is a discussion of updates to critical accounting estimates during 2012 for a complete discussion of aig critical accounting estimates see the 2011 annual report on form 10 k recoverability of deferred tax asset aig considers the recoverability of its deferred tax asset to be a critical accounting estimate the evaluation of the recoverability of aig deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires aig to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion about aig framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets aig 2012 form 10 q 161 table of contents american international group inc recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs short duration chartis recoverability of dac is based on the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned generally 12 months for short duration insurance contracts dac is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts for short duration insurance contracts starting on january 1 2012 aig has elected to include anticipated investment income in its determination of whether the deferred policy acquisition costs are recoverable aig believes the inclusion of anticipated investment income in the recoverability analysis is a preferable accounting policy as it includes in the recoverability analysis the fact that there is a timing difference between when the premiums are collected and in turn invested and when the losses and related expenses are paid this is considered a change in accounting principle that requires retrospective application to all periods presented because aig historically has not recorded any premium deficiency on its short duration insurance contracts even without the inclusion of anticipated investment income there were no changes to the historical financial statements for the change in accounting principle aig assesses the recoverability of its dac on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred this assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income on inforce business to the sum of expected claims claims adjustment expenses anticipated maintenance costs and unamortized dac if the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for dac this offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge management tested the recoverability of dac and determined that recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income of its chartis domestic commercial and consumer and international commercial and consumer operations exceeded the sum of these costs at march 31 2012 on

benefit of these transactions for financial institution counterparties was generally derived from basel i in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision finalized basel iii which when

multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aig calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average prices for cdos increased during the first quarter of 2012 further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the binomial expansion technique bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the

billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 3 0 billion the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities while the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a cdo the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile especially given current market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo
