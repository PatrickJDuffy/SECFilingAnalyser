gaap measures throughout this md and a we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results some of the measurements we use are nongaap financial measures under securities and exchange commission rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the nongaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarlynamed measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and book value per common share excluding aoci and deferred tax assets dta adjusted book value per common share are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci and dta adjusted shareholders equity by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a return on equity after tax operating income excluding aoci and dta adjusted return on equity is used to show the rate of return on shareholders equity we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on equity adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized after tax operating income attributable to aig by average adjusted shareholders equity the reconciliation to return on equity the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a after tax operating income attributable to aig is derived by excluding the tax effected pre tax operating income ptoi adjustments described below and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges and uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance general operating expenses operating basis is derived by making the following adjustments to general operating and other expenses include i certain loss adjustment expenses reported as policyholder benefits and losses incurred and ii certain investment and other expenses reported as net investment income and exclude i advisory fee expenses ii non deferrable insurance commissions iii direct marketing and acquisition expenses net of deferrals iv non operating litigation reserves and v other expense related to an asbestos retroactive reinsurance agreement we use general operating expenses operating basis because we believe it provides a more meaningful indication of our ordinary course of business operating costs regardless of within which financial statement line item these expenses are reported externally within our segment results the majority of these expenses are employee related costs for example other acquisition expenses and losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily represent employee related costs in the underwriting and claims functions respectively excluded from this measure are non operating expenses such as restructuring costs and litigation reserves direct marketing expenses insurance company assessments and non deferrable commissions we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the results of operations section of this md and a aig second quarter 2017 form 10 q 73 table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures operating revenues exclude net realized capital gains losses income from non operating litigation settlements included in other income for gaap purposes and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits included in net investment income for gaap purposes operating revenues is a gaap measure for our operating segments pre tax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from income from continuing operations before income tax this definition is consistent across our modules including geography these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions and measures that we believe to be common to the industry ptoi is a gaap measure for our operating segments data table removed commercial insurance liability and financial lines property and special risks consumer insurance personal insurance ratios we along with most property and casualty insurance companies use the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses which for commercial insurance excludes net loss reserve discount and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on aig in excess of 10 million each catastrophes also include certain man made events such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the 10 million threshold we believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of managements control we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results consumer insurance individual retirement group retirement and life insurance other operations institutional markets premiums and deposits includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies group benefit policies and lifecontingent payout annuities as well as deposits received on universal life investmenttype annuity contracts and mutual funds results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures aig second quarter 2017 form 10 q 74 table of

factors such as interest rates currency exchange rates credit and equity market conditions catastrophic claims events regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continued to operate under difficult market conditions in the first six months of 2017 characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates the department of labors the dol final fiduciary duty rule the dol fiduciary rule volatile energy markets slowing growth in china and euro zone economies and the formal commencement of the united kingdoms the uk withdrawal from its membership in the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has also affected the u s dollar british pound exchange rate increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro british pound and the japanese yen the major currencies which may continue for some time impact of changes in the interest rate environment interest rates decreased marginally in the first six months of 2017 and have remained at historically low levels certain markets in which we operate have experienced negative interest rates a sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset liability management including spread management strategies for our investment oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities annuity sales and surrenders the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on investment returns which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products however our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads as long as the low interest rate environment continues conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales but may also drive higher surrenders customers are however currently buying fixed annuities with surrender periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment in addition older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio we will closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for guaranteed products with income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio aig second quarter 2017 form 10 q 82 table of contents item 2 executive summary reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets including the level of interest rates credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment the low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity in addition there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain inforce business specifically the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the assetliability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability the following table presents fixed annuities and group retirement base net investment spread data table removed fixed annuities base net investment spread increased in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2017 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily as a result of lower interest crediting rates due to disciplined pricing and active crediting rate management group retirements base net investment spread decreased in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2017 compared to the same periods in the prior year as a result of lower reinvestment yields in both the three and six month periods ended june 30 2017 and lower prepayment income received on commercial mortgage loans in the six month period ended june 30 2017 which more than offset the decrease in crediting rates for additional information on our investment and asset liability management strategies see investments for investment oriented products in our individual retirement group retirement life insurance and institutional markets businesses our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads using asset liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees we will continue to adjust crediting rates on in force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment contractual minimum crediting rates and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre established intervals for example competitors including private equity held annuity writers are currently offering higher crediting rates as a result the timing and extent of crediting rate decreases may differ from the corresponding declines in investment yields which could reduce our spreads and future profitability of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products 73 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at june 30 2017 the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 70 percent at both june 30 2017 and december 31 2016 these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the core universal life business in our life insurance business 72 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at june 30 2017 aig second quarter 2017 form 10 q 83 table of contents item 2 executive summary the following table presents fixed annuity and universal life account values of our core individual retirement group retirement and life insurance businesses by contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate and current crediting rates data table removed individual retirement and group retirement amounts shown include fixed options within variable annuity products commercial insurance the impact of low interest rates on our commercial insurance segment is primarily on our long tail casualty line of business we expect limited impacts on our existing long tail casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities we do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long tail casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates however we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection in addition for our commercial insurance segment and run off insurance lines reported within the legacy portfolio sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers compensation and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves additionally sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense aig second quarter 2017 form 10 q 84 table of contents item 2 executive summary department of labor fiduciary rule our individual retirement and group retirement operating segments provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to restrictions imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa and the internal revenue code including the requirements of the dol fiduciary rule related exemption amendments and subsequent interpretative guidance overall the dol fiduciary rule as currently promulgated would result in increased compliance costs and may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances including class actions on april 4 2017 the dol announced a 60 day extension of the applicability dates of the dol fiduciary rule and related exemptions this announcement followed a february 3 2017 presidential memorandum that directed the dol to review the dol fiduciary rule and determine whether the dol fiduciary rule will adversely impact the ability of retirement savers to access retirement information and financial advice under the terms of the dols extension the new definition of fiduciary and the impartial conduct standards under the dol fiduciary rule became applicable on june 9 2017 the dol also requested comments on the issues raised by the presidential memorandum and noted its intent to complete its review and decide whether to make or propose further changes to the dol fiduciary rule or associated exemptions in the interim continued uncertainties in the annuity market around the impact and implementation of this rule including potential delays and possible modifications have continued to significantly affect distributors negatively impacting industry sales of annuity products including those offered by individual retirement in the absence of further action by the dol full compliance with the dol fiduciary rule will be required by january 1 2018 we believe based on our understanding of the dol fiduciary rule that we implemented the adjustments necessary to achieve compliance with the applicable provisions of the rule and we are closely following the dols ongoing review and assessment of this rule impact of currency volatility currency volatility remains acute such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations in particular growth trends in net premiums written reported in u s dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies the net effect on underwriting results however is significantly mitigated as both revenues and expenses are

companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk return tax liquidity credit quality and diversification objectives outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by property casualty insurance companies consist primarily of high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate while more of a focus is placed on asset liability management in life insurance companies our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics to the extent practicable aig parent included in other operations actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and duration aig parents liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities based upon an assessment of its immediate

respectively net investment income for the three month period ended june 30 2017 was lower than the same period in the prior year due to lower invested assets and blended investment yields on new

the fair value option net investment income for the six month period ended june 30 2017 was higher than the same period in the prior year as higher income on our alternative investments primarily in our hedge fund portfolio and gains on assets for which we elected the fair value option more than offset lower invested assets and blended investment yields on new investments that were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called attribution of net investment income to operating modules net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses for commercial insurance liability and financial lines property and special risks and consumer insurance personal insurance and legacy property casualty insurance run off lines we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums the allocation of net investment income of the property casualty insurance companies to modules is calculated based on these estimated investable funds consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the required economic capital allocation for each module for consumer insurance individual retirement group retirement and life insurance other operations institutional markets and legacy life insurance run off lines net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our life insurance companies all invested assets of the life insurance companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital allocation for each module asset liability measurement for the property casualty insurance companies the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines as a result the investment strategy within the property casualty insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital subject to liability and other business considerations the property casualty insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans while invested assets backing reserves of the property casualty insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields particularly in the domestic operations in addition we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset backed investments for their risk return attributes as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates this asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged we expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the property casualty insurance companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current riskreturn and tax objectives in addition the property casualty insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio aig second quarter 2017 form 10 q 127 table of contents item 2 investments fixed maturity securities of the property casualty insurance companies domestic operations with an average duration

adjusted after tax returns the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings fixed maturity securities held in the property casualty insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings with an average duration of 3 5 years the investment strategy of the life insurance companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value subject to liquidity requirements capital constraints diversification requirements assetliability management and available investment opportunities the life insurance companies use assetliability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses the life insurance companies fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that to the extent practicable complements the characteristics of liabilities including duration which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities and as a result certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio the life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans in addition the life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields while a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the life

include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade while naic designations of 3 through 6 generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities including non agency rmbs and cmbs which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured

unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of 56 million and 66 million respectively this unfavorable development was primarily a result of the following higher than expected losses for u s other

the site wrap business along with other large individual claims with nearly all of the unfavorable development coming from accident years 2015 and prior and roughly one third from accident years 2006 and prior unfavorable development in u s excess casualty driven by continued unfavorable claim experience in the construction defects and wrap business primarily from accident years 2006 and prior and higher than expected losses in property and special risks driven by unexpected development on several large international claims including aviation marine and trade credit primarily from accident year 2016 in addition in the first quarter of 2017 we increased our loss reserves by 102 million as a result of the decision made by the uk ministry of justice to reduce the discount rate applied to lump

this discount rate change primarily impacted the europe casualty and financial lines these prior year loss reserve increases were partially offset by the recognition of the amortization of the

item 2 insurance reserves life and annuity reserves and dac the following section provides discussion of life and annuity reserves and dac variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results our individual retirement and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with gmwb riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features the liabilities for gmwb are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates equity prices credit spreads market volatility and policyholder behavior in addition to risk mitigating features in our variable annuity product design we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb including exposures to changes in interest rates equity prices credit spreads and volatilities the hedging program utilizes derivative instruments including but not limited to equity options futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see part ii item 7 md and a enterprise risk management insurance risks life insurance companies key insurance risks variable annuity risk management and hedging programs in our 2016 annual report differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders the economic hedge target differs from the u s gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivatives due to the following the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations the u s gaap valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for u s gaap valuation such as margins for policyholder behavior mortality and volatility and the economic hedge target excludes the non performance or own credit risk adjustment npa used in the u s gaap valuation which reflects a market participants view of our claims paying ability by incorporating an additional spread the npa spread to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements because the discount rate includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margins the u s gaap valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors and to changes from actuarial assumption updates than the economic hedge target the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program the life insurance companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns which may be either positive or negative realized volatility versus implied volatility actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging particularly policyholder behavior and risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge aig

our economic hedge target data table removed impact on pre tax income loss the impact on our pre tax income loss of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments both of which are recorded in other realized capital gains losses realized capital gains losses as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program are excluded from pre tax operating income of individual retirement and group retirement the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target the u s gaap embedded derivatives and changes in the fair value of the hedging portfolio as discussed above when corporate credit spreads widen the change in the npa spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a gain and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a loss in addition to changes driven by credit market related movements in the npa spread the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits the following table presents the net increase decrease to consolidated pre tax income loss from changes in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives and related hedges excluding related dac amortization data table removed the net impact on pre tax income from the gmwb and related hedges in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2017 excluding related dac amortization was primarily driven by losses on a u s gaap basis from the impact of tightening credit spreads on the npa spread in both periods and the impact on the npa volume of lower expected gmwb payments in the six month period ended june 30 2017 driven by higher equity markets in the three month period ended june 30 2016 npa adjustments had a net positive impact on pre tax income primarily due to higher expected gmwb payments partially offset by the impact of tightening credit spreads on the npa spread however in the six month period ended june 30 2016 both components of the npa adjustment had a positive impact on pre tax income the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives excluding npa in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2017 was substantially offset by the related hedging portfolio however in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 gains from the change in fair value of the hedging portfolio were more than offset by losses from the change in fair value of embedded derivatives excluding npa primarily due to a significant reduction in interest rates which impacted the embedded derivative liability excluding npa more than the related impact to the hedging portfolio fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically aig second quarter 2017 form 10 q 144 table of contents item 2 insurance reserves not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a u s gaap basis due to the npa and other risk margins used for u s gaap valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio on an economic basis the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the decrease in the economic hedge target as discussed below change in economic hedge target the decrease in the economic hedge target liability in the first half of 2017 was primarily due to positive equity markets and increases in market interest rates partially offset by tighter credit spreads and lower equity volatility change in fair value of the hedging portfolio the changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and to a lesser extent the embedded derivatives were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities primarily corporate bonds for which the fair value option has been elected are used as a capital efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread related risk the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2017 was a small gain due to tightening of credit spreads while the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 included more significant gains primarily due to decreases in market interest rates partially offset by the impact of widening credit spreads the change in the fair value of the hedging bonds which is excluded from the pre tax operating income of the individual retirement and group retirement segments is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of income loss changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts which included swaps swaptions and futures resulted in a smaller net gain in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2017 compared to significant gains from interest rate declines in the same periods in 2016 the change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts which included futures and options resulted in losses in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2017 and to a lesser extent in the three and six month
