consistent with its management structure aigs segments are general insurance life insurance and retirement services financial services and asset management aigs operations in 2007 and 2006 were conducted by its subsidiaries through these segments through these segments aig provides insurance financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions this geographic product and service diversification is one of aigs major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors aigs other category consists of items not allocated to aigs operating segments aigs subsidiaries serve commercial institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network in the united states aig companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and are among the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well aigs financial services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing capital markets operations and consumer finance both in the united states and abroad aig also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals as part of its spread based business activities aig issues various debt instruments in the public and private markets outlook the following paragraphs supplement and update the information and discussion included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k to reflect developments in or affecting aigs business during 2007 the commercial property and casualty insurance industry has historically experienced cycles of price erosion followed by rate strengthening as a result of catastrophes or other significant losses that affect the overall capacity of the industry to provide coverage despite industry price erosion in commercial lines aig expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new general insurance businesses as a result of aigs broad product line and extensive distribution networks in the u s and abroad workers compensation remains under considerable pricing pressure as statutory rates continue to decline rates for excess casualty d and o and certain other lines of insurance also continue to decline due to competitive pressures there can be no assurance that price erosion will not become more widespread or that aigs profitability will not deteriorate from current levels in major commercial lines however aig seeks to mitigate this risk by constantly seeking out profitable opportunities across its diverse product lines and distribution networks in aigs foreign retirement services business the continued weak yen has resulted in higher than normal surrenders and that trend if prolonged could further accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs dac similarly in the domestic retirement services business the flat yield curve and the age of the in force blocks of individual fixed annuities could result in an acceleration of surrender activity as early as 2008 in japan the national tax authority in cooperation with the life insurance association of japan is reviewing the tax treatment for increasing term life insurance which may affect the amount of premiums that qualify as tax deductions for business owners as a result of this review aigs life insurance companies in japan suspended the sale of increasing term life insurance from early april 2007 this action will have an adverse effect on life insurance sales in the second half of 2007 aig companies in japan have taken several measures aimed at increasing sales of other products in the japanese market in particular sales of u s dollar life insurance products in march 2007 the u s treasury department published proposed new regulations that if adopted in their current form would limit the ability of u s taxpayers to claim foreign tax credits in certain circumstances under the internal revenue code should the proposed regulations be adopted in their current form they would limit aigs ability to claim foreign tax credits in connection with certain structured transactions entered into by aig financial products corp and aig trading group inc and their respective subsidiaries collectively aigfp resulting in a material adverse effect on aigfps operating results the u s residential mortgage market is experiencing serious disruption due to deterioration in the credit quality of loans originated to non prime and subprime borrowers 29 american international group inc and subsidiaries evolving changes in the regulatory environment and a slower residential housing market aig participates in the u s residential mortgage market in several ways american general finance inc agf extends first and second lien mortgage loans to buyers and owners of residential housing united guaranty corporation ugc provides mortgage guaranty insurance for first and second lien residential mortgages aig insurance and financial services subsidiaries invest in mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations cdos in which the underlying collateral is composed in whole or in part of residential mortgage loans and aigfp provides credit protection through credit default swaps on certain senior tranches of such cdos the operating results of aigs consumer finance and mortgage guaranty operations in the united states have been and are likely to continue to be adversely affected by the factors referred to above the downward cycle in the u s housing market is not expected to improve until residential inventories return to a more normal level and the mortgage credit market stabilizes aig expects that this downward cycle will continue to adversely affect ugcs operating results for the foreseeable future although ugc is beginning to experience improved credit quality trends on new production the effect of the downward cycle in the u s housing market on aigs other operations investment portfolio and overall consolidated financial position is not expected to be material due to aigs disciplined underwriting and active risk management as well as the high credit ratings for assets collateralized by subprime and non prime mortgages and the structural protections against loss afforded aig by its senior position in the investments and exposures that it holds in recent quarters aigs returns from partnerships and other alternative investments have been particularly strong driven by favorable equity market performance and credit conditions these returns may vary significantly from period to period aig believes that the particularly strong performance in recent periods is not indicative of the returns to be expected from this asset class in future periods consolidated results the following table summarizes aigs consolidated revenues

management believes that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover general insurance net losses and loss expenses as of june 30 2007 while aig regularly reviews the adequacy of

liabilities 43 american international group inc and subsidiaries data table removed in determining the quarterly loss development from prior accident years aig conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each profit center for example if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center as appropriate in the second quarter of 2007 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the second quarter of 2007 as part of its quarterly reserving process aig also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues such as those related to stock option backdating also as part of the quarterly reserving process beginning with the second quarter of 2007

and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k aigs reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground up analysis in the first six months of 2007 one large

removed survival ratios asbestos and environmental the table below presents aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at june 30 2007 and 2006 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the june 30 2007 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at june 30 2006 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments in addition aigs survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by the favorable settlements described above which reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at june 30 2007 by approximately 1 7 years and 4 1 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined

percent of total policyholder benefit liabilities at june 30 2007 resulted from traditional business where the lock in principle applies in most foreign locations guarantees have been made to pay benefits to policyholders for many decades into the future as experience changes over time the best estimate assumptions are updated to reflect the observed changes because of the long term nature of many of aigs liabilities subject to the lock in principle small changes in certain of the assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy that exists in particular changes in estimates of future invested asset return assumptions have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy that exists taiwan beginning in calendar year 2000 the yield available on taiwanese 10 year

years and gradually increase to best estimate assumptions of a market consensus view of long term interest rate expectations foreign assets are assumed to comprise 35 percent of invested assets resulting in a composite long term investment assumption of approximately 4 7 percent and the currently permitted practice of offsetting positive mortality experience with negative interest margins thus eliminating the need for mortality dividends will continue future results of the reserve adequacy tests are uncertain given the long term nature of the business and the volatility inherent in actual investment yields the inability to achieve assumed investment returns could accelerate dac amortization and necessitate reserve strengthening 62 american international group inc and

on the consolidated statement of income asset management operating income increased in the three month period ended june 30 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 primarily due to higher investment

related to the spread based investment business increased in the three months ended june 30 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 due to an increase in partnership income associated with the domestic gic program and higher income from hedge funds and private equity partnerships partnership income is primarily derived from alternative investments and is affected by performance in the equity markets thus revenues operating income and cash flows attributable to gics will vary from reporting period to reporting period offsetting this growth in operating income was the continued runoff of gic balances a significant portion of the remaining gic portfolio consists of floating rate obligations aig has entered into hedges to manage against increases in short term interest rates aig believes these hedges are economically effective but they did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 income or loss from these hedges are classified as net realized capital gains

reported in the spread based investment business declined during the three months ended june 30 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 primarily due to foreign exchange losses on foreign denominated debt that while economically hedged did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 including a 36 million out of period loss recorded in the second quarter of 2007 during 2005 the mip replaced the gic program as aigs principal institutional spread based investment activity aig does not expect that income growth in the mip will offset the runoff in the gic portfolio for the foreseeable future because the asset mix under the mip does not include 69 american international group inc and subsidiaries the alternative investments utilized in the gic program commencing with

income related to the spread based investment business increased in the first six months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 due to a significant increase in partnership income associated with the domestic gic program and increased returns from hedge funds and private equity partnerships partnership income in the first six months of 2007 included a distribution from a single partnership of 164 million which became available after a five year restriction on capital withdrawals mip operating income grew in the first six months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 reflecting

foreign investment contracts which were historically reported as a component of the spread based investment business are now being reported in the life insurance and retirement services segment all prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation quarterly institutional asset management results operating income for institutional asset management increased in the three months ended june 30 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 reflecting the 398 million gain from the sale of a portion of aigs investment in blackstone group lp in connection with its initial public offering operating income for the three months ended june 30 2007 was negatively affected by a decline in net realized capital gains related to real estate investments as well as carried interest on private equity investments which were particularly strong during the same period of 2006 also negatively affecting operating income was a decrease in carried interest which was driven by lower valuations of portfolio investments and is generally associated with performance in the equity markets and lower gains on certain consolidated investments and partnerships these gains are offset in minority interest expense which is not a component of operating income on the consolidated statement of income year to date institutional asset management results operating income for institutional asset management increased in the first six months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 reflecting the 398 million gain from the sale of a portion of aigs investment in blackstone group lp in connection with its initial public offering and increased carried interest driven by higher valuations of portfolio investments which are generally associated with improved performance in the equity markets operating income also reflects higher gains on certain consolidated investments and partnerships however these gains are offset in minority interest expense partly offsetting these gains was a decrease in net realized capital gains related to real estate investments as well as increased expenses resulting from investment in sales and infrastructure enhancements aigs unaffiliated client assets under management including retail mutual funds and institutional accounts increased 15 percent to 86 5 billion from december 31 2006 to june 30 2007 contributing to growth in its base management fees additionally aig investments successfully launched several new private equity and real estate funds in the first half of 2007 which provide both a base management fee and the opportunity for future performance fees while unaffiliated client assets under management and the resulting management fees continue to increase the growth in operating income has trailed the growth in revenues due to higher fund related expenses as well as sales and infrastructure enhancements the fund related expenses are associated with investments acquired and held in anticipation of future fund launches it is anticipated that these expenses will be recovered from fund entities in future periods the sales and infrastructure enhancements are associated with aigs planned expansion of marketing and distribution capabilities combined with technology and operational infrastructure related improvements other operations the operating loss of aigs other category was as follows data table removed 70 american international group inc and subsidiaries the operating loss of aigs other category increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2007 compared to the comparable

less than 4 percent of the fixed income securities have issuer credit ratings which are below investment grade aig did not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at june 30 2007 as management has the intent and ability to hold these investments until they fully recover in value at june 30 2007 unrealized losses for fixed maturity securities and equity securities did not reflect any significant industry concentrations the amortized cost of fixed maturity securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at june 30 2007 by contractual maturity is shown below data table removed for the six months ended june 30 2007 the pre tax realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were 598 million the aggregate fair value of securities sold was 22 2 billion which was approximately 97 percent of amortized cost the average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the six months ended june 30 2007 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately seven months risk management for a complete discussion of aigs risk management program see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k insurance asset management and non trading financial services var aig performs one comprehensive value at risk var analysis across all of its non trading businesses and a separate var analysis for its trading business at aigfp the comprehensive var is categorized by aig business segment general insurance life insurance and retirement services financial services and asset management and also by market risk factor interest rate currency and equity aig calculated the var with respect to net fair values as of june 30 2007 and december 31 2006 the var number represents the maximum potential loss as of those dates that could be incurred with a 95 percent confidence and a one month holding period 82 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents the period end average high and low vars on a diversified basis and of each component of market risk for aigs non trading businesses the diversified var is usually smaller than the sum of its components due to correlation effects data table removed increased equity investment allocation in the life insurance and retirement services and general insurance segments as well as growth in those businesses contributed to the modest growth in aigs total non trading var during the first six months of 2007 interest rate and equity volatilities continued to moderate in many markets capital markets trading var aigfps policy is to maintain a conservative market risk profile and minimize risks in interest rates equities commodities and foreign exchange in addition aigfps primary market exposures in option implied volatilities correlations and basis risks are closely managed aigfps minimal reliance on market risk driven revenue is reflected in its var because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale at market is substantially hedged segregation of the financial instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary aigfp reports its var using a 95 percent confidence interval and a one day holding period 83 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents the period end average high and low vars based on daily observations on a diversified basis and of each component of market risk for aigs capital markets operations the diversified var is usually smaller than the sum of its components due to correlation effects data table removed catastrophe exposures the nature of aigs business exposes it to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year in order to control this exposure aig uses a combination of techniques including setting aggregate limits in key business units monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect aigs operating results other risks such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease such as the avian influenza a virus h5n1 could adversely affect aigs business and operating results to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance programs aig evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of industry recognized models among other techniques aig supplements these models by periodically monitoring the exposure risks of aigs worldwide general insurance operations and adjusting such models accordingly following is an overview of modeled losses associated with the more significant natural perils which includes exposures for dbg personal lines foreign general other than ascot the hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company and 21st century transatlantic and ascot utilize a different model and their combined results are presented separately below significant life and a and h exposures have been added to these results as well the modeled results assume that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to aig in accordance with their terms it is important to recognize that there is no standard methodology to project the possible losses from total property and workers compensation exposures further there are no industry standard assumptions to be utilized in projecting these losses the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses therefore these modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not reflect aigs maximum exposures to these events it is highly likely that aigs losses will vary perhaps significantly from these estimates aig has revised the catastrophe exposure disclosures presented below from that presented in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k to include significant life and a and h exposures to natural perils as well as to update the domestic property exposures to reflect more recent data the modeled results provided in the table below were based on the aggregate exceedence probability aep losses which represent total property workers compensation life and accident and health losses that may occur in any single year from one or more natural events the life and a and h data include exposures for united states japan and taiwan earthquakes these represent the largest share of life and a and h exposures to earthquake a and h losses were modeled using december 2006 data and life losses were modeled using march 2006 data the updated property exposures were generally modeled with exposure data as of year end 2006 lexington commercial lines exposure which represents the largest share of the modeled losses was based on data as of april 2007 all reinsurance program structures including both domestic and international structures have also been updated the values provided were based on 100 year return period losses which have a one percent likelihood of being exceeded in any single year thus the model projects that there is a one percent probability that aig could incur in any year losses in excess of the modeled amounts for these perils 84 american international group inc and subsidiaries data table removed includes hurricanes typhoons and other wind related events the combined earthquake and tropical cyclone 100 year return period modeled losses for ascot and transatlantic together are estimated to be 1 1 billion on a gross basis 761 million net of reinsurance and 494 million net after income taxes or 0 5 percent of total shareholders equity at june 30 2007 in addition aig evaluates potential single event earthquake and hurricane losses that may be incurred the single events utilized are a subset of potential events identified and utilized by lloyds 1 and referred to as realistic disaster scenarios rdss the purpose of this analysis is to utilize these rdss to provide a reference frame and place into context the model results however it is important to note that the specific events used for this analysis do not necessarily represent the worst case loss that aig could incur from this type of an event in these regions the losses associated with the rdss are included in the table below single event modeled property and workers compensation losses to aigs worldwide portfolio of risk for key geographic areas are set forth below gross values represent aigs liability after the application of policy limits and deductibles and net values represent losses after reinsurance is applied data table removed 1 lloyds realistic disaster scenarios scenario specifications april 2006 the specific international rds events do not necessarily correspond to aigs international property exposures as a result aig runs its own simulations where property statistical return period losses associated with the written exposure specific to aig provide the basis for monitoring risk based on these simulations the 100 year return period loss for japanese earthquake is 296 million gross and 120 million net the 100 year return period loss for european windstorm is 269 million gross and 80 million net and the 100 year return period loss for japanese typhoon is 306 million gross and 252 million net recent market conditions in the u s property business have supported growth in this line of business consequently gross modeled catastrophe losses have increased associated net exposure has been carefully monitored and controlled through the strategic placement of reinsurance actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and the occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on aigs financial condition results of operations and liquidity 85 american international group inc and subsidiaries item 3
