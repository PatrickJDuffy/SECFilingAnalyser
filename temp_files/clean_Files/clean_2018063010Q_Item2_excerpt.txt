present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results some of the measurements we use are nongaap financial measures under securities and exchange commission rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the nongaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarlynamed measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and book value per common share excluding aoci and deferred tax assets dta adjusted book value per common share are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci and dta adjusted shareholders equity by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a return on equity adjusted after tax income excluding aoci and dta adjusted return on equity is used to show the rate of return on shareholders equity we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets

equity the reconciliation to return on equity the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a adjusted after tax income attributable to aig is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre tax income apti adjustments described below and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance and net tax charge related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act tax act we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the consolidated results of operations section of this md and a adjusted revenues exclude net realized capital gains losses income from non operating litigation settlements included in other income for gaap purposes and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits included in net investment income for

by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax this definition is consistent across our segments these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions and measures that we believe to be common to the industry apti is a gaap measure for our segments excluded items include the following data table removed general insurance ratios we along with most property and casualty insurance companies use the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses which for general insurance excludes net loss reserve discount and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting natural and man made catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on aig in excess of 10 million each and also include certain man made events such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the 10 million threshold we believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of managements control we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results life and retirement premiums and deposits includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies group benefit policies and lifecontingent payout annuities as well as deposits received on universal life investmenttype annuity

2018 form 10 q table of contents item 2 executive summary financial performance summary net income attributable to aig three months ended june 30 in millions quarterly 2018 and 2017 comparison decreased due to lower investment returns on alternative investments primarily driven by less robust private equity and hedge fund performance compared to the same period in 2017 and a decline in income from securities for which the fair value option was elected as a result of credit spread widening and rising interest rates lower premiums due to the sale of fuji life in the second quarter of 2017 and higher general and other operating expenses this decrease was partially offset by lower policyholder benefits and losses incurred driven by pre tax favorable prior year loss reserve

consolidated results of operations aigs outlook industry and economic factors our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates currency exchange rates credit and equity market conditions catastrophic claims events regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continued to operate under difficult market conditions in the first six months of 2018 characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates uncertainties in the annuity marketplace resulting from legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at re evaluating the standard of care for sales of investment products and services historically high levels of catastrophic events slowing growth in china and euro zone economies and the uks pending withdrawal from its membership in the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has also affected the u s dollar british pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro british pound and the japanese yen the major currencies which may continue for some time impact of changes in the interest rate environment interest rates continued to increase in the first six months of 2018 but remained low relative to historical levels a sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset liability management including spread management strategies for our investment oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities additionally sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense annuity sales and surrenders the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on investment returns which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products however our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads as long as the low interest rate environment continues conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales but may also drive higher surrenders customers are however currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment in addition older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio we will closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for annuities with guaranteed income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio aig second quarter 2018 form 10 q 83 table of contents item 2 executive summary reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets including the level of interest rates credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment the low interest rate environment puts margin pressure on pricing of new business and on existing products due to the challenge of investing new money or recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low interest rate environment in addition there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain inforce business specifically the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the assetliability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability for additional information on our investment and asset liability management strategies see investments for investment oriented products in our individual retirement group retirement life insurance and institutional markets businesses our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads using asset liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees we will continue to adjust crediting rates on in force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment contractual minimum crediting rates and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre established intervals of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products 70 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at june 30 2018 the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 70 percent and 69 percent at june 30 2018 and december 31 2017 respectively these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the core universal life business in our life insurance business 71 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at june 30 2018 84 aig second quarter 2018

operating segments by contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate and current crediting rates data table removed individual retirement and group retirement amounts shown include fixed options within variable annuity products general insurance the impact of low interest rates on our general insurance segment is primarily on our long tail casualty line of business we expect limited impacts on our existing long tail casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities sustained low interest rates would potentially impact new and renewal business for the long tail casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates however we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection in addition for our general insurance segment and general insurance run off lines reported within the legacy portfolio sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers compensation and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves aig second quarter 2018 form 10 q 85 table of contents item 2 executive summary standard of care developments our individual retirement and group retirement operating segments provide products and services that are subject to restrictions imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa and the internal revenue code including the requirements set forth in the final fiduciary duty rule issued by the department of labor the dol in april 2016 the dol fiduciary rule on march 15 2018 the u s court of appeals for the fifth circuit the fifth circuit ruled that the dol exceeded its authority in promulgating the dol fiduciary rule specifically in its broadening the scope of investment advice fiduciary and in the terms of the best interest contract exemption following the fifth circuits decision the dol announced on march 16 2018 that it was suspending enforcement of the dol fiduciary rule pending further review the fifth circuit subsequently denied on may 22 2018 a motion to reconsider the panels decision and a further motion for rehearing by the full fifth circuit if the fifth circuits final judgment is not further appealed the ruling has the effect of invalidating the dol fiduciary rule in its entirety in addition to recent developments surrounding the dol fiduciary rule the securities and exchange commission sec lawmakers and state insurance regulators are also engaged in re evaluating what is an appropriate regulatory framework around a standard of care for the sale of investment products and services on april 18 2018 the sec proposed a package of rulemakings and interpretations designed to address the standard of care issues and the transparency of retail investors relationships with investment advisors and broker dealers the comment period for these proposed rules expires on august 7 2018 we are evaluating the scope and potential impact of the secs proposals and are closely following other similar federal and state level regulatory developments while we cannot predict the long term impact of these developments on our retirement businesses we believe our diverse annuity product offerings position individual retirement and group retirement to compete effectively in this evolving marketplace impact of currency volatility currency volatility remains acute such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations in particular growth trends in net premiums written reported in u s dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies the net effect on underwriting results however is significantly mitigated as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected these currencies may continue to fluctuate in either direction especially as a result of the uks announced exit from the eu and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in u

second quarter 2018 form 10 q 91 table of contents item 2 consolidated results of operations u s tax reform overview on december 22 2017 the u s enacted public law 115 97 known informally as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act the tax act reduced the statutory rate of u s federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacted numerous other changes impacting aig and the insurance industry at december 31 2017 we originally recorded a provisional estimate of income tax effects of the tax act of 6 7 billion including a tax charge of 6 7 billion attributable to the reduction in the u s corporate income tax rate and tax benefit of 38 million related to the deemed repatriation tax during the six month period ended june 30 2018 we have not recorded any material adjustments to these provisional amounts we continue to refine our analysis and calculations which could impact the provisional estimates previously recorded accordingly as of june 30 2018 we have not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act changes specific to the insurance industry include the calculation of insurance tax reserves and related transition adjustments amortization of specified policy acquisition expenses treatment of separate account dividends received deductions and computation of pro ration adjustments provisions of the tax act with broader application include reductions or elimination of deductions for certain items e g reductions to corporate dividends received deductions disallowance of entertainment expenses and limitations on the deduction of certain executive compensation costs these provisions generally result in an increase in aigs taxable income the tax act includes provisions for global intangible low taxed income gilti under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and for base erosion and anti abuse tax beat under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to affiliated foreign companies there are substantial uncertainties in the interpretation of beat and gilti and formal guidance from the u s tax authority is still pending depending on the content of such guidance changes to the interpretations and assumptions made by us and or actions we may take it is possible that the impact from beat or gilti could change amounts recorded possibly materially consistent with accounting guidance we treat beat as a period tax charge in the period the tax is incurred and have made an accounting policy election to treat gilti taxes in a similar manner in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets we made certain assumptions related to the impact of the tax act on our future taxable income generally the tax act provisions result in an increase in our taxable income and thus accelerate utilization of our tax attribute deferred tax asset accordingly we do not currently anticipate that our reliance on provisional estimates would have a material impact on our determination of the realizability of our deferred tax assets repatriation assumptions as a result of the tax act the majority of accumulated foreign earnings that were previously untaxed are subject to a one time deemed repatriation tax going forward foreign earnings not taxed as part of the one time deemed repatriation or otherwise taxed currently under the gilti or subpart f regimes will generally be exempt from u s tax upon repatriation notwithstanding the changes u s tax on foreign exchange gain or loss and certain non u s withholding taxes will continue to be applicable upon future repatriations of foreign earnings for the six month period ended june 30 2018 we still consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in canada south africa the far east latin america bermuda as well as the european asia pacific and middle east regions to be indefinitely reinvested these earnings relate to ongoing

portfolio of fixed maturity securities that to the extent practicable complements the characteristics of liabilities including duration which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities and as a result certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer

derivatives measured at fair value the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates equity prices credit spreads market volatility policyholder behavior and other factors in addition to risk mitigating features in our variable annuity product design we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb including

interest rate swap and swaption contracts as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see enterprise risk management insurance risks life and retirement companies key risks variable annuity risk management and hedging programs in our 2017 annual report differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders the economic hedge target differs from the u s gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivatives primarily due to the following the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations the u s gaap valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for u s gaap valuation such as margins for policyholder behavior mortality and volatility and the economic hedge target excludes the non performance or own credit risk adjustment used in the u s gaap valuation which reflects a market participants view of our claims paying ability by incorporating an additional spread the npa spread to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows because the discount rate includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margins the u s gaap valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors and to changes from actuarial assumption updates than the economic hedge target for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program the life and retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns which may be either positive or negative realized volatility versus implied volatility actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging particularly policyholder behavior and risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully

corporate credit spreads widen the change in the npa spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a gain and when corporate credit spreads narrow or

by the related hedging portfolio fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a u s gaap basis due to the npa and

currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels at the market risk level the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis in addition we continue to use enhanced economic gaap accounting and statutory capitalbased risk measures at the market risk level businessunit level and firmwide levels this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures we use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure including examples include sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities and a one percent increase in prices of equity securities scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in worldwide equity markets scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses stress

evaluate our interest rate risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives this scenario does not measure changes in value resulting from non parallel shifts in the yield curve which could produce different results we evaluate our equity price risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives this scenario considers the direct impact of declines in equity prices and not changes in asset based fees changes in the estimated gross profits used for amortizing dac or changes in any other assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivatives related to the living benefit features within variable annuity products in addition this scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk such as projections about
