corporation agc was acquired and consolidated into aig charges in connection with this acquisition totaled 1 36 billion for that quarter during the second quarter of 2001 agc incurred 654 million in connection with the termination of its merger agreement with prudential plc thus for all of 2001 aig incurred 2 02 billion of charges in connection with the acquisition of agc with respect to the charges of 1 36 billion incurred in the third quarter of 2001 approximately 512 million was related to direct costs of the acquisition of the 512 million 85 million was attributable to investment banking legal and accounting fees the remaining direct costs of 427 million were related to employee severance and other termination benefits and other compensation costs related to change in control agreements with agc executives the costs were also based in part on a projected elimination of positions in accordance with aigs post business combination plans which were intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the combined operations of the total direct costs of 512 million 430 million have been paid as of june 30 2003 including approximately 14 million 111 million and 305 million paid during the first six months of 2003 and the 10 twelve months of 2002 and 2001 respectively in addition during 2002 32 million of liabilities were utilized to absorb other insignificant

as at june 30 2003 including 8 million 113 million and 669 million in the first six months of 2003 and the twelve months of 2002 and 2001 respectively the balance 61 million is reflected as a component of other liabilities as of june 30 2003 7 starr international company inc plan starr international company inc sico provides a deferred compensation profit participation plan sico plan to certain aig employees the sico plan came into being in 1975 when the voting shareholders and board of directors of sico a private holding company whose principal asset consists of aig common stock decided that a portion of the capital value of sico should be used to provide an incentive plan for the current and succeeding managements of all american international companies including aig participation in the sico plan by any person and the amount of such participation is at the sole discretion of sicos board of directors and none of the costs of the various benefits provided under such plan is paid by or charged to aig the sico plan provides that shares currently owned by sico may be set aside by sico for the benefit of the participant and distributed upon retirement the sico board of directors may permit an early pay out under certain circumstances prior to pay out the participant is not entitled to vote dispose of or receive dividends with respect to such shares and shares are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions including but not limited to the participants voluntary termination of employment with aig prior to normal retirement age in addition sicos board of directors may elect to pay a participant cash in lieu of shares of aig common stock if the expenses of the sico plan had been reflected by aig the pre tax amounts accrued would have been 64 2 million for the first six months of 2003 and 25 1 million for the same period of 2002 and 32 1 million and 12 5 million for the second quarter 2003 and 2002 respectively 8 commitments and contingent liabilities in the normal course of business various commitments and contingent liabilities are entered into by aig and certain of its subsidiaries in addition aig guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries a commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend subject to certain conditions these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and typically require payment of a fee these commitments have not deviated materially from december 31 2002 at which time they approximated 400 million aig uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments aig evaluates each counterpartys creditworthiness on a case by case basis the amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by aig upon extension of credit is based on managements credit evaluation of the counterparty b aig and certain of its subsidiaries become parties to financial instruments with market risk resulting from both dealer and end user activities and to reduce currency interest rate equity and commodity exposures to the extent those instruments are carried at their estimated fair value the elements of currency interest rate equity and commodity risks are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet collateral is required at the discretion of aig on certain transactions based on the creditworthiness of the counterparty c aigfp and aigtg each become parties to derivative financial instruments in the normal course of their business and to reduce currency interest rate commodity and equity exposures interest rate currency commodity and equity risks related to such instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 11 to the extent these instruments are carried at a market or a fair value whichever is appropriate the recorded estimated fair values of such instruments may be different than the values that might be realized if aigfp and aigtg were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aigfp and aigtg in the ordinary course of their operations and as principal structure derivative transactions to meet the needs of investors who may be seeking to hedge certain aspects of such investors operations aigfp and aigtg may also enter into derivative transactions for their own account such derivative transactions include interest rate currency commodity and equity swaps swaptions forward and option commitments interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts aigfp and aigtg typically become a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and therefore may be exposed to loss if counterparties default currency commodity and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps but involve the exchange of specific currencies or the cashflows based on the underlying commodity and equity securities or indices also they may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction at june 30 2003 the notional principal amount of the sum of the swap pays and receives approximated 1 076 8 billion primarily related to interest rate swaps of approximately 677 4 billion the following tables provide the contractual and notional amounts of derivatives transactions by maturity and type of aigfp and aigtg at june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the notional amounts used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of swaps business of aigfp and aigtg notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received except for certain contracts such as currency swaps the timing and the amount of cash flows relating to aigfps and aigtgs foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements the following table presents the contractual and notional amounts by maturity and type of derivative of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolio at june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 in millions data table removed notional amount is not representative of either market risk or credit risk futures and forward contracts are contracts for delivery of foreign currencies commodities or financial indices in which the seller purchaser agrees to make take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument at a specified price or yield options are contracts that allow the holder of the option to purchase or sell the underlying commodity currency or index at a specified price and within or at a specified period of time as a writer of options aigfp and aigtg generally receive an option premium and then manage the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the underlying commodity currency or index risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts at june 30 2003 the contractual amount of aigfps and aigtgs futures forward and option contracts approximated 295 5 billion 12 the following table presents aigfps and aigtgs futures forward and option contracts portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 in millions data table removed sold options obligate aigfp and aigtg to buy or sell the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise the amounts do not represent credit exposure aigfp enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary course of its business the overwhelming majority of aigfps credit derivatives require aigfp to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities aigfp provides such credit protection only on a second loss basis under which aigfps payment obligations arise only after credit losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold amount or level of first losses the threshold amount of credit losses that must be realized before aigfp has any payment obligation is negotiated by aigfp for each transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment obligation by aigfp under each transaction is remote even in severe recessionary market scenarios in many cases the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies typically there will be an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio and then successive layers that are rated generally a bbb rated layer an a rated layer an aa rated layer and an aaa rated layer in transactions that are rated the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior to the threshold level above which aigfps payment obligation would arise is rated aaa by the rating agencies for that reason the risk layer assumed by aigfp with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions is often called the super senior risk layer defined as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been rated aaa by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated equivalent thereto for example in a transaction with an equity layer covering credit losses from 0 to 2 percent of the total portfolio a bbb rated layer covering credit losses from 2 to 4 percent an a rated layer from 4 to 6 percent an aa rated layer from 6 to 8 percent and a aaa rated layer from 8 to 11 percent aigfp would cover credit losses arising in respect of the portfolio that exceeded an 11 percent first loss threshold amount and thereby bear risk that is senior to the 8 to 11 percent aaa rated risk layer aigfp continually monitors the underlying portfolios to determine whether the credit loss experience for any particular portfolio has caused the likelihood of aigfp having a payment obligation under the transaction to be greater than super senior risk aigfp maintains the ability opportunistically to hedge specific securities in a portfolio thereby further limiting its exposure to loss and has hedged outstanding transactions in this manner on occasion aigfp has never had a payment obligation under these credit derivatives transactions furthermore based on portfolio credit losses experienced to date under all outstanding transactions no transaction has experienced credit losses in an amount that has made the likelihood of aigfp having to make a payment in aigfps view to be greater than remote even in severe recessionary market scenarios at june 30 2003 the notional amount with respect to aigfps credit derivative portfolio was 160 36 billion aigfp and aigtg utilize various credit enhancements including letters of credit guarantees collateral credit triggers credit derivatives and margin agreements to reduce the credit exposure relating to these off balance sheet financial instruments aigfp and aigtg require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on among other things the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transactions size and maturity in addition aigfps and aigtgs derivative transactions are generally documented under isda master agreements management believes that such agreements provide for legally 13 enforceable set off and close out netting of exposures to specific counterparties under such agreements in connection with an early termination of a transaction aigfp and aigtg are permitted to set off their receivables from a counterparty against their payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions as a result the net replacement value represents the net sum of estimated positive fair values after the application of such strategies agreements and collateral held subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate currency commodity and equity swaps options swaptions forward commitments futures and forward contracts approximated 17 15 billion at june 30 2003 and 17 38 billion at december 31 2002 the net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to aigfp and aigtg or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss aigfp and aigtg independently evaluate the creditworthiness of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations in addition aigfps and aigtgs credit approval processes involve pre set counterparty country and industry credit exposure limits and for particularly credit intensive transactions obtaining approval from aigs credit risk committee the average credit rating of aigfps and aigtgs counterparties as a whole as measured by aigfp and aigtg is equivalent to aa the maximum potential loss will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions aigfp and aigtg determine counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or where such ratings are not available by internal analysis at june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the counterparty credit quality with respect to the net replacement value of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolios were as follows in millions data table removed a exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposures as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis b the net replacement values with respect to exchange traded futures and options forward contracts and purchased over the counter options are presented as a component of trading assets in the

forward transactions in the accompanying balance sheet 14 at june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolio was as follows in millions data table removed exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposures as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis securities sold but not yet purchased and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased represent obligations of aigfp and aigtg respectively to deliver specified securities and spot commodities at their contracted prices and thereby create a liability to repurchase the securities and spot commodities in the market at prevailing prices aigfp and aigtg monitor and control their risk exposure on a daily basis through financial credit legal reporting systems credit approvals and limits and accordingly believes that it has in place effective procedures for evaluating and limiting the credit and market risks to which it is subject management is not aware of any potentially significant counterparty defaults at june 30 2003 aigfp and aigtg did not have a significant concentration of credit risk from either an individual counterparty or group of counterparties aig has issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment when due of all present and future payment obligations and liabilities of aigfp and aigtg arising from transactions entered into by aigfp and aigtg revenues for the six months ended june 30 2003 and 2002 from aigfps operations were 676 million and 538 million respectively d at june 30 2003 ilfc had committed to purchase 459 aircraft deliverable from 2003 through 2010 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of 26 2 billion and had options to purchase 18 aircraft deliverable from 2003 through 2008 at an estimated aggregate purchase price of 1 3 billion ilfc will be required to find customers for any aircraft acquired and it must arrange financing for portions of the purchase price of such equipment e aig and its subsidiaries in common with the insurance industry in general are subject to litigation including claims for punitive damages in the normal course of their business aig does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition future operating results or liquidity however the recent trend of increasing jury awards and settlements makes it somewhat more difficult to assess the ultimate outcome of such litigation in late 2002 a shareholder derivative action was filed in delaware chancery court alleging breaches of fiduciary duty of loyalty and care against aigs directors aig management believes the allegations of the complaint are without merit aigs board of directors has appointed a special committee of independent directors to review the complaint and respond to the lawsuit aig continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste hazardous substances and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites hereinafter collectively referred to as environmental claims and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process as these claims which emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques asbestos and environmental claims development is affected by factors such as inconsistent court 15 resolutions the broadening of the intent of policies and scope of coverage and increasing number of new claims aig and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of policy coverage and the liability issues if the courts continue in the future to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage as they have in the past additional liabilities would emerge for amounts in excess of reserves held this emergence cannot now be reasonably estimated but could have a material impact on aigs future operating results the reserves carried for these claims as at june 30 2003 2 09 billion gross 676 million net are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on known facts and current law aigs general insurance companies have a special asbestos and environmental a and e claims unit actively managing a and e claims aigs experienced claims professionals evaluate case reserves for aig losses at the earliest possible time reserving to ultimate probable loss based upon known facts current law jurisdiction policy language and other factors aig routinely reviews the adequacy of a and e case reserves aig does not discount a and e reserves aig uses primarily two methods to test the a and e reserves one method the market share method produces indicated a and e reserve needs by applying the appropriate aig company market share to estimated potential industry ultimate loss loss expense based on the latest estimates from a m best and tillinghast a second method a frequency severity approach is also utilized this approach utilizes current information as the basis of an analysis that predicts for the next 10 years the number of future environmental claims expected and the average severity of each the trend in frequency created is based upon assumptions judged by aig to be the most reasonable the trend in severity starts with initial severities based on actual average current severity under the varying case adequacy assumptions and trending forward under assumptions deemed most reasonable by aig a similar report year claim projection analysis is also performed for asbestos this analysis predicts future asbestos losses for the next 20 years based on the actual claim activity a summary of reserve activity for the six months ended june 30 2003 and 2002 including estimates for applicable incurred but not reported losses and loss expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined is as follows data table removed all amounts pertain to policies underwritten

are issued primarily to facilitate financing for the construction of the underlying properties and range in duration of up to ten years since the inception of this investment program over ten years ago payments under these guarantees have been insignificant this is due to the fact that the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner and secondly are secured by the underlying properties the maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable security under these guarantees as of june 30 2003 is approximately 3 4 billion in addition aigs real estate investment operations will occasionally extend similar guarantees to real estate partnerships in which they are an investor the guarantees facilitate financing for the construction 19 and or purchase of land there have been no payments to date under these guarantees this is due to the fact that the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner and secondly are

consolidated in aigs consolidated financial statements an entity is subject to fin46 and is called a variable interest entity vie if it has i equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entitys operations or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary which is the party that has a majority of the expected losses or a majority of

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is designed to provide the reader a narrative with respect to aigs operations financial condition and liquidity and certain other significant matters index data table removed executive summary aigs operations are conducted principally through four business segments general insurance life insurance financial services and retirement savings and asset management within each of these business segments are various operating groups generally formed based upon products or services which may be offered in different geographic locations throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aig presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful as well as most transparent gross premiums written statutory underwriting profit loss and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with aigs insurance competitors consolidated results aigs revenues in the first six months of 2003 increased 18 4 percent to 38 8 billion when compared to 32 8 billion in the same period of 2002 growth in revenues was primarily attributable to the 26 growth in net premiums earned from the global insurance operations this growth was negatively impacted by realized capital losses incurred of 988 million in 2003 compared to 861 million in 2002 aigs income before income taxes and minority interest increased 11 0 percent in the first six months of 2003 when compared to the same period of 2002 general insurance operating income was the primary reason for this growth aigs effective income tax rates were 30 47 percent for net income and 33 41 percent for realized capital gains losses in 2003 compared to 30 80 percent and 34 98 percent respectively in 2002 aigs net income in the first six months of 2003 increased 11 9 percent to 4 23 billion when compared to 3 78 billion in the same period of 2002 the following table summarizes the operations of each principal segment for the first six months of 2003 and 2002 data table removed a represents the sum of net premiums earned net investment income and realized capital gains losses b represents the sum of gaap life premiums net investment income and realized capital gains losses c represents financial services commissions transactions and other fees d represents retirement savings and asset management commissions and other fees general insurance general insurance operating income increased 26 0 percent in the first six months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 this increase was primarily attributable to strong growth in operating income with respect to domestic brokerage groups and foreign generals operations realized capital losses with respect to general insurance operations amounted to 256 million and 282 million for the first six months of 2003 and 2002 respectively life insurance life insurance operating income increased 8 3 percent in the first six months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 this increase resulted from growth in each of aigs principal life insurance businesses partially offset by realized capital losses of 516 million and 339 million for the first six months of 2003 and 2002 respectively financial services financial services operating income increased 13 5 percent in the first six months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 reflecting profits derived from a diversified range of businesses and products retirement savings and asset management retirement savings and asset management operating income increased 0 8 percent in the first six months of 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002 equity markets have improved in recent months although they remain below june 30 2002 levels realized capital losses during the first six months of 2003 aigs realized capital losses aggregated 988 million these realized capital losses reflect continued weakness in the equity markets and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings upon the ultimate disposition of these holdings a portion of these losses may be recovered depending on future market conditions capital resources at june 30 2003 aig had total capital funds of 68 36 billion and total borrowings of 76 87 billion at that date 67 93 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by aig or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements gias or matched notes and bonds payable during the period from january 1 2003 through june 30 2003 aig repurchased in the open market 1 625 000 shares of its common stock liquidity at june 30 2003 consolidated invested assets were 479 8 billion including 14 03 billion in cash and short term investments consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in the first six months of 2003 amounted to 13 11 billion 27 outlook premium rates in the general insurance business are continuing to strengthen both domestically and in key international markets along with policy restrictions and exclusions aig expects that rate increases will continue through 2003 such increases will positively impact on cash flow available for investment thus general insurances net investment income is expected to rise in future quarters even in the current low interest rate environment in the life insurance segment aig expects continued growth overall focused in its major product lines such as life insurance personal accident pension and investment products and group life health aig continues to expand its operations in china becoming the first foreign insurance organization to have wholly owned life insurance operations in beijing suzhou dongguan and jiangmen as well as previously established operations in shanghai foshan guangzhou and shenzhen aig also expects india korea and vietnam to offer additional opportunities for growth asia the largest region of foreign life had good operating income and premium growth in the first six months of 2003 the outbreak of sars in asia which has since abated had a short term impact on first year life insurance policy sales earlier in 2003 the sars epidemic has however heightened the awareness of the importance of protection policies and aig has introduced a series of new products to serve this need aig expects that ilfc will continue its growth and operating profitability even as the airline industry remains under stress ilfc derives over 80 percent of its lease revenues from foreign carriers thus limiting its exposure to the domestic commercial aviation market which is more depressed than the rest of the industry aig is also optimistic about opportunities for growth in its consumer finance business both domestically and through continued expansion of overseas credit card operations and alternative distribution systems such as the use of the internet during 2003 aig also expects to expand its recently formed international retirement savings operations critical accounting estimates aig considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts deferred policy acquisition costs and fair value determinations with respect to certain assets and liabilities of certain of the subsidiaries of aigs financial services operations these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used aigs results of operations would be directly impacted throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aigs critical accounting estimates are discussed in significant detail the major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below

current market price data such as published exchange rates from external subscription services such as bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available aig uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the transactions operational

removed 29 data table removed general insurance results during the first six months of 2003 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 30 3 percent and 32 3 percent respectively from those of 2002 commencing in the latter part of 1999 and continuing through and into the current quarter the commercial property casualty market place has experienced rate increases virtually all areas of dbg have experienced rate increases as well as maintaining an excellent retention rate for desired renewal business the vast majority of the increase in the first six months of 2003 resulted from rate increases with respect to renewed business overall dbgs net premiums written increased 2 47 billion or 34 7 percent in the first six months of 2003 over 2002 adjusting this growth for cancelled or non renewed business such growth would have approximated 40 percent personal lines net premiums written increased 16 4 percent or 251 million in the first six months of 2003 from 2002 reflecting auto insurance rate increases in many states foreign general insurance net premiums written increased 27 5 percent and net premiums earned increased 35 2 percent in the first six months of 2003 when compared to the same period of 2002 net premiums written growth was most significant in continental europe and the united kingdom the product lines that had significant growth were excess casualty and financial lines in comparing the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of aigs foreign general operations during the first six months of 2003 to those average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate aigs foreign general results during the same period of 2002 the u s dollar weakened slightly in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly when foreign net premiums written were translated into u s dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 2 0 percentage points more than they would have been if translated utilizing those average foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during that same period of 2002 net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period aig along with most general insurance entities uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance the loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss the statutory general insurance ratios for the six months ending june 30 2003 and 2002 were as follows data table removed 30 data table removed the domestic and foreign combined ratios improved over last years primarily due to the growth in net premiums exceeding the growth in expenses as well as heightened expense control aig believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company underwriting profit is measured in two ways statutory underwriting profit and generally accepted accounting principles gaap underwriting profit statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting differs from gaap as statutory accounting in general requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes expenses are recognized immediately not over the same period that the revenues are earned a basic premise of gaap accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the principle of matching therefore to convert underwriting results to a gaap basis acquisition expenses are deferred deferred policy acquisition costs dac and amortized over the period the related premiums written are earned accordingly statutory underwriting profit is adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by gaap dac is reviewed for recoverability and such review requires management judgment a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit exclusive of investment income when underwriting is not profitable premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses therefore investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses if assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods an insurance company cannot survive for these reasons aig views its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations see also the discussion under liquidity herein the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity regulation product type and competition have a direct impact on pricing and consequently profitability as reflected by underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios the effects of catastrophes incurred in the first six months of 2003 and 2002 were insignificant with respect to catastrophe losses aig believes that it has taken appropriate steps to reduce the magnitude of possible future losses the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity such as a terrorist attack earthquake or hurricane that causes insured losses however could have a material adverse effect on aigs results of operations liquidity or financial condition current techniques and models may not accurately predict in the future the probability of catastrophic events and the extent of the resulting losses moreover one or more catastrophe losses could impact negatively aigs reinsurers and result in an inability of aig to collect reinsurance recoverables the impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from period to period making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult general insurance net investment income in the first six months of 2003 increased 6 3 percent when compared to the same period of 2002 the invested cash flow resulting from the growth in net premiums written in this and prior periods had a positive impact on net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein general insurance realized capital losses were 256 million and 282 million in the first six months of 2003 and 2002 respectively these realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and reflect continued weakness in the equity markets and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings see the discussion on valuation of invested assets herein general insurance operating income for the first six months of 2003 increased 26 0 percent to 31 2 36 billion the contribution of general insurance operating income to aigs consolidated income before income taxes and minority interest was 37 1 percent during the first six months of 2003 compared to 32 6 percent in the same period of 2002 reinsurance aig is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations aig is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs aig insures general risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide aig the level of reinsurance protection that aig desires these reinsurance arrangements do not relieve aig from its direct obligations to its insureds aigs general reinsurance assets amounted to 30 35 billion at june 30 2003 and resulted from aigs reinsurance arrangements thus a credit exposure existed at june 30 2003 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse aig under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements aig manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and when necessary aig holds substantial collateral in the form of funds securities and or irrevocable letters of credit this collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis at december 31 2002 approximately 40 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers in order to obtain statutory recognition the majority of these balances were collateralized the remaining 60 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 90 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated a excellent or better as rated by a m best through june 30 2003 these distribution percentages have not changed significantly this rating is a measure of financial strength the terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories not creditworthiness aigs allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance has not changed significantly from december 31 2002 when aig had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating 120 million at june 30 2003 aig had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled e g liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction aigs reinsurance security department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic such assessments include but are not limited to identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates this department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral in addition aigs credit risk committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer aig enters into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for its general and life operations aig enters these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among various legal entities these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation at june 30 2003 the general reinsurance assets of 30 35 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of 3 84 billion and 22 54 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses including ceded losses incurred but not reported ibnr ceded reserves the ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments thereto are reflected in income currently it is aigs belief that the ceded reserves at june 30 2003 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable in the future as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses the table below classifies as of june 30 2003 the components of the general insurance reserve for 32 losses and loss expenses loss reserves with respect to major lines of business on a statutory basis data table removed presented pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners these loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including ibnr and loss expenses certain of these loss reserves are discounted these discounted reserves relate primarily to certain workers compensation claims at june 30 2003 general insurance net loss reserves increased 2 74 billion from prior year end to 33 09 billion the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently it is managements belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at june 30 2003 there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of june 30 2003 in the future if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations in a very broad sense the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups one group being long tail casualty lines of business such lines include excess and umbrella liability directors and officers liability professional liability medical malpractice general liability products liability and related classes the other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses net losses for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors including the line and volume of the business involved in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses that is a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid a relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be ibnr aigs carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses carried for long tail casualty lines these methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next for the majority of long tail casualty lines net loss trend factors approximated six percent loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling exposure and policy forms current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted as appropriate to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience thus many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs recognized aig annually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves this review does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates as developing a range of loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful this is because aigs general insurance business is primarily in long tail casualty lines driven almost entirely by severity rather than frequency of claims rather an estimate is calculated which aigs actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve this amount is evaluated against actual carried reserves if there is a significant disparity an adjustment is made to the carried reserves a number of actuarial assumptions are made in the review of reserves for each individual segment for segments in longer tail lines of business actua 33 rial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following 1 loss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years 2 expected loss ratios for the latest accident year i e accident year 2002 for the year end 2002 loss reserve analysis and in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years adjusted for the loss trend see 1 above and the impact of rate changes and other quantifiable factors for low frequency high severity classes such as excess casualty and directors and officers liability expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years 3 loss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis to the extent the actual loss development factors loss trend factors or other factors used to establish expected loss ratios differ from those assumed in aigs loss reserve studies aigs loss reserve position would be directly impacted while it may be possible to assume loss reserve ranges for high frequency shorter tail classes of business it is aigs judgment that the concept of a meaningful loss reserve range does not apply to low frequency high severity long tail classes such as excess casualty and directors and officers liability d and o the past decade has shown that actual loss trends for these classes of business from year to year and the resulting adequacy of expected loss ratios and of the resulting carried loss reserves cannot reasonably be expected to fall within any particular range for example loss costs nearly doubled during just a three accident year period for aigs excess casualty and d and o segments while loss costs for these same two classes actually declined for several years in the early 1990s the causes of this increase in loss costs include irrational jury awards and liability inflation that could not have been anticipated in pricing tort system out of control an explosion in medical costs and related liabilities and the dot com bubble and corporate governance related issues that have affected d and o additionally it is important to note that most of aigs business falls into the category of longer tail lines of business due to the multitude of such classes and the volume of detail for each it would not be possible to provide complete claim frequency settlement closure and other data for all such segments nor does aig believe that such disclosure by class of business would be meaningful or useful to the reader it should be noted that none of the other segments or classes reflects the highly uncertain qualities that apply to the asbestos and environmental claims as more fully described below for example traditional actuarial methodologies can be applied to classes such as excess casualty directors and officers liability healthcare and the other long tail coverages that aig writes these methodologies cannot be applied to asbestos and environmental exposures other than asbestos and environmental exposures there is no area of significant exposure to aig for which traditional actuarial methodologies cannot be applied the concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines for example if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property the growth in the propertys exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased asbestos and environmental claims aig continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste hazardous substances and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years aig established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claim units which investigate and adjust all such asbestos 34 and environmental claims these units utilize a comprehensive ground up approach to claim adjusting by thoroughly evaluating each exposure on a claim by claim basis commencing in 1985 standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented however aig currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process these asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage the current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future additionally the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties in the interim aig and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues at the current time it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage as they have in the past as well as by the changes in superfund and waste dump site coverage issues although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims the reserves carried for these claims at june 30 2003 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law furthermore as aigs net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves in the future if the environmental claims develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations see the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein the majority of aigs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages not primary coverages thus the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves that is litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability aig incurs individual significant claim liabilities where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable are established on a case basis in asbestos for example aig has resolved all claims with respect to miners and product manufacturers tier i for which payments are completed or reserves are established to cover future payment obligations asbestos claims with respect to products containing asbestos tier 2 accounts are generally very mature losses and have been appropriately recognized and reserved by aigs asbestos claims operation aig believes that the vast majority of the incoming claims with respect to products containing small amounts of asbestos and companies in the distribution chain and parties with remote ill defined involvement with asbestos tier 3 and 4 should not impact its coverage this is due to a combination of factors including the increasingly peripheral companies being named in asbestos litigation smaller limits issued to peripheral defendants tenuous liability cases against peripheral defendants attachment points of the excess policies and the manner in which resolution of these weaker cases would be allocated among all insurers including non aig companies over a long period of time a summary of reserve activity for the six months ended june 30 2003 and 2002 including estimates for applicable ibnr relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined is as follows data table removed 35 data table removed all amounts pertain to policies underwritten

asbestos and environmental claims payments this is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years therefore the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments the higher the ratio the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments these ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments it should be noted however that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio the developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments court orders covered claims with no coverage defenses state mandated cleanup costs claims where aigs coverage defenses are minimal and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting also aig considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary aig believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio the special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages aigs asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites as a result aig reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies aigs survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at june 30 2003 and 2002 were as follows data table removed aigs operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states as a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws a solvent 36 insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state aig generally records these assessments upon notice additionally certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities therefore the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated the guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2002 were 76 million based upon current information aig does not anticipate that its net assessment will be significantly different in 2003 aig is also required to participate in various involuntary pools principally workers compensation business which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets this participation is also recorded upon notification as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated life insurance operations aigs life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products traditional products consist of individual and group life annuity endowment and accident and health policies financial and investment products consist of fixed and variable annuities guaranteed investment contracts and pensions aigs three principal overseas life operations are american life insurance company alico american international assurance company limited together with american international assurance company bermuda limited aia and nan shan life insurance company ltd nan shan alico is incorporated in delaware and all of its business is written outside of the united states alico has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in europe africa latin america the caribbean the middle east and the far east with japan being the largest territory in 2001 aig added significantly to its presence in japan with the acquisition of aig star life insurance co ltd aig star life as a result of the reorganization of chiyoda mutual life insurance company aia operates primarily in china including hong kong singapore malaysia and thailand nan shan operates in taiwan aigs principal domestic life insurance subsidiaries include aig american general life companies aig annuity insurance company and sunamerica life insurance company these companies utilize multiple distribution channels including brokerage and career and general agents to offer traditional life products as well as financial investment products see also note 2 of notes to financial statements life insurance operations presented on a major product basis for the six month periods ending june 30 2003 and 2002 were as follows in millions data table removed amounts presented were as at june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 37 life insurance results life insurance operating income increased 8 3 percent to 2 76 billion during the first six months of 2003 when compared to the same period last year the contribution of life insurance operating income to aigs consolidated income before income taxes and minority interest amounted to 43 4 percent during the first six months of 2003 compared to 44 4 percent in the same period of 2002 contributing to the groups performance were improved profit margins resulting from expense reductions redeployment of invested assets achieving increased yields monitoring of crediting rates to maintain margins and increased production of protection policies in asia aigs gaap life premiums during the first six months of 2003 increased by 1 2 billion representing a 12 0 percent increase from the same period in 2002 domestically the growth is predominantly attributable to the pension and investment products which include structured settlements life insurance and group life health with respect to the foreign life segment the majority of the growth was attributable to the life insurance and personal accident lines of business this growth was most significant in southeast asia where aig maintains significant market share established by its strong agency force and in japan where aig is benefiting from a flight to quality foreign life operations produced 77 1 percent and 77 3 percent of aigs consolidated gaap life premiums in 2003 and 2002 respectively the traditional life products particularly individual life products as well as personal accident were major contributors to the growth in foreign premiums these traditional life products coupled with the increased distribution of financial and investment products contributed to the growth in foreign investment income a mixture of traditional accident and health and financial products are being sold in japan through alico and aig star life since aig purchased aig star life a part of income earned by aig star life has resulted from surrender charges earned on policies that were either surrendered or lapsed this favorable impact on operating income was anticipated when aig took control as these surrenders diminish in subsequent periods operating income from that source will also be impacted the majority of aig star lifes future income is expected to be related to continuing premiums paid on renewal business and new business to be generated from a growing agency force as previously discussed the u s dollar weakened slightly in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly for the first six months of 2003 when foreign life premiums were translated into u s dollars for purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total life premiums were approximately 2 6 percentage points more than they would have been if translated utilizing average exchange rates prevailing in 2002 life insurance net investment income increased 12 5 percent during the first six months of 2003 the growth in net investment income was attributable to both foreign and domestic invested new cash flow for investment as well as returns on nontraditional investments this cash flow was generated from life insurance operations and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein life insurance realized capital losses for the first six months were 516 million in 2003 and 339 million in 2002 these realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing management of the life insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and reflect continued weakness in the equity markets and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings see the discussion on valuation of invested assets herein underwriting and investment risk the risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk the risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is primarily investment risk underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality morbidity termination and expenses aigs foreign life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately 1 5 million of coverage and aigs domestic life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to 2 5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance 38 the investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets primarily long term fixed rate investments being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments to minimize its exposure to investment risk aig tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit if a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur a demand could be placed upon liquidity see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs foreign operations as it has been throughout aigs history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities for example in japan and several southeast asia territories the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities additionally there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts while continuing to maintain satisfactory investment quality to the extent permitted under local regulation aig may invest in qualified longer term securities outside japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield aig is able to manage any asset liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs domestic operations as there is ample supply of qualified long term investments aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes for the alico operations in japan the variable life contract separate account fund performance has varied from the level assumed in the original pricing of the product thus a general account liability has been established for the potential shortfall of future contract revenues the ultimate liability is predominately dependent upon the fund performance in the future deferred policy acquisition costs dac for life insurance products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new or renewal business policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy policy acquisition costs which relate to universal life and investment type products non traditional life products are deferred and amortized with interest in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less interest required as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the impact on the amortization of dac the estimation of projected gross profits requires significant management judgment the elements with respect to the current and projected gross profits are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are appropriately adjusted dac for both traditional life and non traditional life products are subject to review for recoverability which involve estimating the future profitability of current business this review also involves significant management judgment 39 financial services operations aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft

operations for the six month periods ending june 30 2003 and 2002 were as follows in millions data table removed a revenues were primarily from aircraft lease rentals b revenues were primarily fees from proprietary positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions c revenues were primarily finance charges financial services results financial services operating income increased 13 5 percent in the first six months of 2003 over the same period of 2002 financial services operating income represented 18 2 percent of aigs consolidated income before income taxes and minority interest in the first six months of 2003 this compares to 17 7 percent in the same period of 2002 ilfc generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account for airlines and for financial institutions revenues in the first six months of 2003 increased 8 8 percent from the same period of 2002 the revenue growth resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment under operating lease and the increase in the relative cost of the leased fleet ilfc has historically derived over 80 percent of its lease revenues with respect to flight equipment from airlines based outside the united states and is not significantly exposed to current domestic airline difficulties passenger miles in asia a major market for ilfc have increased substantially as the risk of sars has abated ilfc typically contracts to re lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term for aircraft returned before the end of the lease term ilfc has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return while some of the lease rates for aircraft that have been redeployed are lower this is partially offset by low interest rates which reduce ilfcs financing costs as a lessor ilfc considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent ilfc had two aircraft off lease at june 30 2003 which had been off lease for less than three months as of july 23 2003 one of the two unleased aircraft was placed all new and used aircraft deliveries in 2003 have been placed and 78 percent of 2004 new aircraft deliveries have been leased ilfc management is very active in the airline industry management formally reviews regularly and no less frequently than quarterly issues affecting ilfcs fleet including events and circum 40 stances that may cause impairment of aircraft values management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary based on these events and circumstances in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 144 ilfc has not recognized any impairment related to its fleet as the existing service potential of the aircraft in ilfcs portfolio has not been diminished further ilfc has been able to re lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates to an extent that would require an impairment write down see also the discussions under liquidity herein during the first six months of 2003 ilfcs operating income decreased 6 0 percent from the same period of 2002 principally due to the impact of certain bankruptcy and other settlements received in 2002 ilfc finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments the composite borrowing rates at the end of the first six months of 2003 and 2002 were 4 50 percent and 5 03 percent respectively see also the discussions under capital resources and liquidity herein and note 2 of notes to financial statements ilfc is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through non performance of aircraft lessees through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease ilfc manages its lessee non performance exposure through credit reviews and security deposit requirements as a result of these measures and its own contingency planning ilfc did not suffer any material losses from airline shutdowns in the aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks but there can be no assurance that ilfc will successfully manage the risks relating to the impact of possible future deterioration in the airline industry approximately 88 percent of ilfcs fleet is leased to non u s carriers and this fleet the most efficient in the airline industry continues to be in high demand from carriers see also the discussions under capital resources and liquidity herein aigfp participates in the derivatives dealer market conducting primarily as principal an interest rate currency equity and credit derivative products business aigfp also enters into structured transactions including long dated forward foreign exchange contracts option transactions liquidity facilities and investment agreements and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities aigfp derives substantially all its revenues from proprietary positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions as a dealer aigfp marks its transactions daily to fair value thus a gain or loss on each transaction is recognized daily aigfp hedges the market risks arising from its transactions therefore revenues and operating income are not significantly exposed to or affected by market fluctuations and volatility revenues of aigfp and the percentage change in revenues for any given period are significantly affected by the number and size of transactions entered into by aigfp during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period operating income and the percentage change in operating income for any period are determined by the number size and profitability of the transactions attributable to that period relative to those attributable to the prior period the realization of operating income as measured by the receipt of funds over the course of time is not a significant reporting event as the profit or loss on each of aigfps transactions has already been reflected in operating income at fair value at the inception aigfps revenues in the first six months of 2003 increased 25 6 percent from the same period of 2002 during the first six months of 2003 operating income increased 26 3 percent from the same period of 2002 such revenues and operating income resulted from aigfps interest rate and credit segments as aigfp is a transaction oriented operation current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance the breakdown by percentage contribution of revenues and operating income for aigfp in the first six months of 2003 and 2002 is set forth below the percentages for operating income are the same as those for revenues because expenses are allocated across all products in proportion to the revenues generated by that product material changes in the distribution of revenues and operating income are not meaningful because of the transactional nature of aigfps business data table removed 41 financial market conditions in the first six months of 2003 compared with the comparable period in 2002 were characterized by lower interest rates across fixed income markets globally a worldwide slump in credit prices combined with a widening of credit spreads and lower equity valuations derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of aigfps business therefore income on interest rate equity and credit derivatives along with their related hedges are recorded on a mark to market value or at estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the income statement in the current year in the first six months of 2003 less than five percent of revenues resulted from transactions valued at estimated fair value the mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the captions unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions and unrealized loss on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions the unrealized gain represents the aggregate of each net receivable by counterparty and the unrealized loss represents the aggregate of each net payable by counterparty these amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates currency rates equity prices and other market variables as well as cash movements execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions spread income on investments and borrowings are recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the transaction investments are classified as available for sale securities and are marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the equity section the most significant component of aigfps operating expenses is compensation which approximated 31 percent and 34 percent of revenues in the first six months of 2003 and 2002 respectively this decrease in percentage resulted from a change in the mix of the transactions attributable to each period domestically aigs consumer finance operations derive a substantial portion of their revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding mortgages and finance receivables from the sub prime market while overseas operations are engaged in developing a multi product consumer finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets revenues increased 5 4 percent in the first six months of 2003 from the same period in 2002 operating income increased 18 7 percent compared to the 2002 period the increase in revenues was the result of growth in average finance receivables and credit quality continues to be strong further reductions of the cost to borrow led to an improvement in the operating income over the previous period consumer finance operations are exposed to loss when contractual payments are not

commodities sold but not yet purchased issuance of equity and cash provided from such operations aigs strong capital position is integral to managing this liquidity as it enables aig to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide see also the discussion under capital resources herein management believes that aigs liquid assets its net cash provided by operations and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements the liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad the combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources underwriting operations and investment operations in the aggregate aigs insurance operations generated approximately 20 5 billion in pre tax cash flow during the first six months of 2003 cash flow includes periodic premium collections including policyholders contract deposits cash flows from investment operations and paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums losses benefits and acquisition and operating expenses generally there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy the losses and benefits are paid aigs insurance investment operations generated approximately 8 2 billion in investment income cash flow during the first six months of 2003 investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses with respect to general insurance operations if paid losses accelerated beyond aigs ability to fund 48 such paid losses from current operating cash flows aig would need to liquidate a portion of its general insurance investment portfolio and or arrange for financing potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable decreased significantly in value see also the discussions under operational review general insurance operations herein with respect to life insurance operations if a substantial portion of the life insurance operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and or defaulted aig would need to liquidate other portions of its life insurance investment portfolio and or arrange financing potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which aig life insurance operations exist nationalization terrorist acts or other such economic or political upheaval see also the discussions under operational review life insurance operations herein in addition to the combined insurance pre tax operating cash flow aigs insurance operations held 12 70 billion in cash and short term investments at june 30 2003 operating cash flow and the cash and short term balances held provided aigs insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity this liquidity is available among other things to purchase predominantly high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate policy loans and collateral loans this cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately 66 billion from the maturities sales and redemptions of fixed income

general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer industry and or country concentrations with respect to general insurance aigs strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase with respect to life insurance aigs strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities see also the discussion under operational review life insurance operations herein the fair value of the fixed maturity available for sale portfolio is subject to decline as interest rates rise and is subject to increase as interest rates decline such changes in fair value are presented as a component of comprehensive income in unrealized appreciation of investments net of taxes credit quality at june 30 2003 approximately 69 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities approximately 32 percent of such domestic securities were rated aaa by one or more of the principal rating agencies approximately 10 percent were below investment grade or not rated a significant portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio is rated by moodys standard and poors s and p or similar foreign services similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations aig annually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated 50 fixed income investments including mortgages at june 30 2003 approximately 17 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated aaa or on the basis of aigs internal analysis were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated approximately 13 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date a large portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date equity investments aig invests in equities for various reasons including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk equity securities are subject to declines in fair value such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments net of taxes as a component of comprehensive income valuation of invested assets the valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market value for each security the source for the market value is generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of non traded securities another aspect of valuation is an assessment of impairment as a matter of policy the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of aigs management and a continual review of its investments in general a security is considered a candidate for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant discount to par amortized cost if lower or cost for an extended period of time the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation or ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or in the opinion of aigs management it is unlikely that aig will realize a full recovery on its investment irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events once a security has been identified as potentially impaired the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price however the market price following a significant credit event of any issuer may be volatile after such an event factors such as market liquidity hedge fund activity sensitivity to headline risk and the widening of bid ask spreads contribute to price volatility because of such volatility the market price may not be indicative of the fair value of such an investment and consequently not indicative of a reasonable estimate of realizable value aig has the ability to hold any security to its stated maturity therefore the decision to sell reflects the judgment of aigs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale as a result of these policies aig recorded in the first six months of 2003 impairment losses net of taxes of approximately 659 million no impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to aigs consolidated financial condition or results of operations and no individual impairment loss exceeded 0 9 percent of consolidated net income for the first six months of 2003 excluding the impairments noted above the changes in market value for aigs available for sale portfolio which constitutes the vast majority of aigs investments were recorded in equity as unrealized gains or losses at june 30 2003 the unrealized losses after taxes of the fixed maturity securities were approximately 1 4 billion at june 30 2003 the unreal 51 ized losses after taxes of the equity securities portfolio were approximately 197 million at june 30 2003 aggregate unrealized gains after taxes were 14 6 billion and aggregate unrealized losses after taxes were 1 6 billion no single issuer accounted for more than five percent of the unrealized losses at june 30 2003 the fair value of aigs fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated to 280 2 billion of this aggregate fair value 1 0 percent represented securities trading at or below 75 percent of amortized cost or cost the impact on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be further mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholders accounts or realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs at june 30 2003 the unrealized losses after taxes for fixed maturity securities and equity securities included the following industry concentrations data table removed the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at june 30 2003 by contractual maturity is shown below data table removed in the six months ended june 30 2003 the pre tax realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were 1 9 billion the aggregate fair value of securities sold was 11 7 billion which was approximately 86 percent of amortized cost the average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the six months ended june 30 2003 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately seven months 52 at june 30 2003 aggregate pre tax unrealized gains were 22 4 billion

losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts or realization will result in a current decrease in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs as stated previously the valuation for aigs investment portfolio comes from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of non traded securities aig considers non traded securities to mean certain fixed income investments certain structured securities direct private equities limited partnerships and hedge funds the aggregate carrying value of these securities at june 30 2003 was approximately 33 9 billion the methodology used to estimate fair value of non traded fixed income investments is by reference to traded securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology this technique takes into account such factors as the industry the securitys rating and tenor its coupon rate its position in the capital structure of the issuer and other relevant factors the change in fair value is recognized as a component of unrealized appreciation for certain structured securities the carrying value is based on an estimate of the securitys future cash flows pursuant to the requirements of emerging issues task force issue no 99 20 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets the change in carrying value is recognized in income direct private equities hedge funds and limited partnerships in which aig holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair value the change in fair value is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income with respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which aig holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest aigs carrying value is the net asset value the changes in such net asset values are recorded in income aig obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the sponsors of each of these 53 investments the accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis each of these investment categories is regularly tested to determine if impairment in value exists various valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in this determination mortgage investments mortgage loans on real estate policy and collateral loans comprised 5 4 percent of aigs insurance invested assets at june 30 2003 aigs insurance operations holdings of real estate mortgages amounted to 11 71 billion of which 88 0 percent was domestic at june 30 2003 only a nominal amount was in default it is aigs practice to maintain a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 percent at loan origination at june 30 2003 aigs insurance holdings of collateral loans amounted to 1 33 billion all of which were foreign it is aigs strategy to enter into mortgage and collateral loans as an adjunct primarily to life insurance fixed maturity investments aigs policy loans increased from 6 05 billion at december 31 2002 to 6 10 billion at june 30 2003 short term investments short term investments represent amounts invested in various internal and external money market funds time deposits and cash held real estate investments aigs real estate investment properties are primarily occupied by aigs various operations the current market value of these properties considerably exceeds their carrying value other investments other invested assets were primarily comprised of limited partnerships and hedge funds when permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets including invested assets from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aig and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users see also the discussion under derivatives herein in certain jurisdictions significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to aig parent these barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds managing market risk aigs insurance operations are exposed to market risk market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques one such technique is value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability aig believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management aig has performed a var analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of aigs insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment in this analysis financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses reserve for unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders funds due to the nature of each insurance segment aig manages the general and life insurance operations separately as a result aig manages separately the invested assets of each accordingly the var analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations 54 aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aigs insurance segments as of june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 aig uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period in this case the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios for each scenario each transaction was re priced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the final var number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence i e only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure a one month holding period was assumed in computing the var figure the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 var with respect to combined operations cannot be derived by aggregating the individual risk or segment amounts presented herein in millions data table removed the following table presents the average

the proceeds of ilfcs debt financings the primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt during the first six months of 2003 ilfc acquired flight equipment costing 3 48 billion see also the discussion under operational review financial services operations and capital resources herein ilfc is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates as of june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 aig statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a var model in this analysis the net fair value of ilfc was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt the estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of ilfc using the historical simulation methodology as previously described as of june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the average var with respect to the aforementioned net fair value of ilfc was approximately 14 million and 20 million respectively aigs consumer finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and overseas such products include real estate mortgages consumer loans and retail sales finance these products are funded through various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes aigs consumer finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties with respect to credit losses the allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio aigfps derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available aigfp reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps trading securities options forwards and futures the estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows these transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if aigfp were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that the impact of any such limited liquidity would not be significant to aigs financial condition or its overall liquidity see also the discussion under operational review financial services operations and derivatives herein 56 aigfp uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and gia borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities including securities available for sale at market and derivative transactions the funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell the proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing gias or other aigfp financings see also the discussion under capital resources herein securities available for sale is mainly a portfolio of debt securities where the individual securities have varying degrees of credit risk at june 30 2003 the average credit rating of this portfolio was aa or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review aigfp has also entered into credit derivative transactions to hedge its credit risk associated with 230 5 million of these securities securities deemed below investment grade at june 30 2003 amounted to approximately 100 million in fair value representing 0 6 of one percent of the total aigfp securities available for sale 30 million of this amount is hedged with a credit derivative there have been no significant downgrades through august 1 2003 securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized transactions aigfp takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell aigfp further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and when aigfp deems necessary it requires additional collateral to be deposited trading securities at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of aigfp aigfp is exposed to credit risk if its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform aigfp could have a liquidity strain aig guarantees aigfps debt and as a result is responsible for all of aigfps obligations aigtg conducts as principal market making and trading activities in foreign exchange and commodities primarily precious and base metals aigtg owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps forwards futures and option contracts aigtg uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices aigtg supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities unrealized losses on swaps short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased see also the discussions under capital resources and derivatives herein the gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of aigfp and aigtg included in the financial services assets and liabilities at june 30 2003 were as follows in millions data table removed a these amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts aigfps interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale at market are managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation at june 30 2003 the unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were 141 million and 169 million respectively trading securities at market value and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time these securities are held to 57 meet the short term risk management objectives of aigfp and aigtg the senior management of aig defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for aigfp and aigtg aigs senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market operational and credit issues of aigfp and aigtg the senior managements of aigfp and aigtg report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with aigs senior management aig actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities in doing so aig must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit market liquidity operational and legal risks managing market risk market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions aigs philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried credit risk exposure is separately managed see the discussion on the management of credit risk below aigs market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aigs market exposures particularly those market exposures of aigfp and aigtg this department determines whether aigs market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aigs senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary aigfp and aigtg are exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices aigfp and aigtg hedge their exposure to these risks primarily through swaps options forwards and futures to hedge interest rate risks aigfp and aigtg may also purchase us and foreign government obligations aigfp and aigtg do not seek to manage the market risk of each transaction through an individual offsetting transaction rather aigfp and aigtg take a portfolio approach to the management of their market risk exposures aigfp and aigtg value their entire portfolios of market sensitive transactions at market value or at estimated fair value when market values are not readily available unrealized gains and losses with respect to these portfolios are reflected in income currently these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of aigfps and aigtgs transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfp aigtg and aigs management estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models these models utilize among other things market liquidity and current interest foreign exchange equity commodity and volatility rates these valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio as described above in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio based upon this evaluation aigfp determines what if any offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio aigfp and aigtg manage market risk with a variety of transactions including swaps trading securities futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate the recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if aigfp were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations financial condition or liquidity such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity aigfp and aigtg attempt to secure reliable and independent current market prices such as published exchange prices external subscription services such as from bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available aigfp and aigtg use an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions historically actual results have not materially deviated from these models 58 aigfps and aigtgs systems can monitor each units respective market positions on an intraday basis aigfp and aigtg operate in major business centers overseas and are essentially open for business 24 hours a day thus the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored reviewed and coordinated around the clock aigfp and aigtg apply various testing techniques which reflect significant potential market movements in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity and equity prices volatility levels and the effect of time these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio the results from these analyses feed into regular senior management reviews of the derivatives portfolio and hedges as described above aigfp and aigtg are exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a var model across both units aigfps and aigtgs asset and liability portfolios for which the var analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments derivative instruments and commodities because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale at market is substantially hedged

among two or more parties the returns of the derivatives are linked to or derived from some underlying equity debt commodity or other asset liability or index derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities certain commodities or financial or commodity indices the more significant types of derivative arrangements in which aig transacts

addition to credit ratings this committee takes into account other factors including the industry and country of the counterparty transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the aig credit risk committee it is also aigs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary aigfp and aigtg determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations if it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement then one or more enhancement techniques will be used examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit guarantees collateral credit triggers credit derivatives and margin agreements a significant majority of aigfps transactions are contracted and documented under isda master agreements management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set off in the event of default also under such agreements in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity aigfp may be permitted to set off its receivables from that counterparty against aigfps payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions excluding regulated exchange transactions aigtg whenever possible enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above discussions with respect to aigfps and aigtgs counterpart credit quality fair value source and notional amounts follow counterparty credit quality the following tables provide the counterparty credit quality amounts of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives transactions at june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to aigfp and aigtg or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies netting under isda master agreements and excluding collateral held subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate currency commodity and equity swaps swaptions forward commitments futures and forward contracts approximated 17 15 billion at june 30 2003 including 2 7 billion of collateral held and 17 38 billion at december 31 2002 including 2 2 billion of collateral held the net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to aigfp and aigtg or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss and is used for financial reporting purposes aigfp and aigtg determine counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or where such ratings are not available by internal analysis at june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the concentration of credit exposure with respect to counterparties judged a or higher by aigfp and aigtg was 93 percent and 90 percent respectively 60 the counterparty credit quality determined by aigfp and aigtg with respect to the net replacement value of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolio was as follows in millions data table removed a exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis b the net replacement values with

replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps are presented as a component of unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions in the accompanying balance sheet at june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolio was as follows in millions data table removed exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis fair value source the fair value sources of the net replacement values of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolio were primarily based on valuation models although these models are proprietary the inputs were obtained from independently published exchange prices external subscription services prices such as bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in these models in the minimal instances when such prices are not available aigfp and aigtg uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions notional amounts the notional amounts used to express the extent of aigfps and aigtgs involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of aigfps and aigtgs swaps business notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received except for certain contracts such as currency swaps 61 the timing and the amount of cash flows relating to aigfps and aigtgs foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements the following table presents the contractual and notional amounts by maturity and type of derivative of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolio at june 30 2003 and december 31 2002 in millions data table removed a notional amount is not representative of either market risk or credit risk aigfp enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary course of its business the overwhelming majority of aigfps credit derivatives require aigfp to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities aigfp provides such credit protection only on a second loss basis under which aigfps payment obligations arise only after credit losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold amount or level of first losses the threshold amount of credit losses that must be realized before aigfp has any payment obligation is negotiated by aigfp for each transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment obligation by aigfp under each transaction is remote even in severe recessionary market scenarios in many cases the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies typically there will be an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio and then successive layers that are rated generally a bbb rated layer an a rated layer an aa rated layer and an aaa rated layer in transactions that are rated the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior to the threshold level above which aigfps payment obligation would arise is rated aaa by the rating agencies for that reason the risk layer assumed by aigfp with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions is often called the super senior risk layer defined as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been rated aaa by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated equivalent thereto for example in a transaction with an equity layer covering credit losses from 0 to 2 percent of the total portfolio a bbb rated layer covering credit losses from 2 to 4 percent an a rated layer from 4 to 6 percent an aa rated layer from 6 to 8 percent and an aaa rated layer from 8 to 11 percent aigfp would cover credit losses arising in respect of the portfolio that exceed an 11 percent first loss threshold amount and thereby bear risk that is senior to the 8 to 11 percent aaa rated risk layer aigfp continually monitors the underlying portfolios to determine whether the credit loss experience for any particular portfolio has caused the likelihood of aigfp having a payment obligation under the transaction to be greater than super senior risk aigfp maintains the ability opportunistically to hedge specific securities in a portfolio thereby further limiting its exposure to loss and has hedged outstanding transactions in this manner on occasion aigfp has never had a payment obligation under these credit derivatives transactions furthermore based on portfolio credit losses experienced to date under all outstanding transactions no transaction has experienced credit losses in an amount that has made the likelihood of aigfp having to make a 62 payment in aigfps view to be greater than remote even in severe recessionary market scenarios at june 30 2003 the notional amount with respect to aigfps credit derivative portfolio was 160 36 billion in addition to its role as derivatives dealer through aigfp and aigtg aig and its subsidiaries including its insurance subsidiaries use derivatives primarily to minimize aigs asset liability exposure and foreign currency and interest rate exposures these transactions are generally executed with aigfp and aigtg as counterparties who in turn hedge these transactions in the market place thus aigfp and aigtg assume the credit risk exposure aig also uses derivatives to help match assets and liabilities in several of its businesses including its insurance operations for example aig can use currency and interest rate swaps to convert foreign currency investment contract liabilities into u s dollar based exposures thus these liabilities are more properly matched with u s dollar assets in life insurance aig uses swaps to reduce the mismatch between long dated life insurance liabilities and shorter dated local currency assets swaps also enable aig to balance its asset and liability durations in consumer finance operations aigs derivatives review committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction the committee examines among other things the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction its potential credit exposure if any and the estimated benefits this committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by aigfp and aigtg for their own accounts generally aig conducts its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment thus exchange gains or losses occur when aigs foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the u s dollar from one reporting period to the next legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability through legal or judicial processes of the obligations of aigs clients and counterparties including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations see also the discussion on master netting agreements above accounting standards in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 142 as of january 1 2002 aig adopted fas 142 fas 142 requires aig to discontinue the amortization of goodwill in its consolidated income statement fas 142 requires goodwill to be subject to an assessment of impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred the assessment of impairment involves a two step process prescribed in fas 142 whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed followed by a measurement of the amount of impairment if any fas 142 also requires the completion of a transitional impairment test in the year of adoption with any identified impairments recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles during the second quarter aig completed its transitional impairment test for 2002 resulting in no impairment changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are primarily caused as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments in november 2002 fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin45 fin45 requires that for guarantees within its scope that are issued or amended after december 31 2002 a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee be established and recognized through earnings to date the impact on earnings for aig has not been and is not expected to be material aig guarantees the indebtedness of third parties principally in connection with aig sunamericas investments in affordable housing properties the guarantees are issued primarily to facilitate financing for the construction of the underlying properties and range in duration of up to ten years since the inception of this investment program over ten years ago payments under these guarantees have been insignificant this is due to the fact that the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner and secondly are secured by the underlying properties the maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable se 63 curity under these guarantees as of june 30 2003 is approximately 3 4 billion in addition aigs real estate investment operations will occasionally extend similar guarantees to real estate partnerships in which they are an investor the guarantees facilitate financing for the construction and or purchase of land there have been no payments to date under these guarantees this is due to the fact that the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner and secondly are secured by the underlying properties the maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable security under these guarantees as of june 30 2003 is approximately 183 million through its ilfc subsidiary aig has also provided other types of guarantees from time to time ilfc participates with airlines banks and other financial institutions to assist in financing aircraft by providing asset guarantees put options or loan guarantees historically losses arising from these guarantees have been immaterial as ilfc has recourse to the value of the underlying aircraft which offsets ilfcs exposure should ilfc be called upon to fulfill its obligations under these guarantees the maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable security of these guarantees as of june 30 2003 is approximately 1 0 billion in january 2003 fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities fin46 fin46 changes the method of determining whether certain entities should be consolidated in aigs consolidated financial statements an entity is subject to fin46 and is called a variable interest entity vie if it has i equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entitys operations or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary which is the party that has a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of the vie or both all other entities not considered vies are evaluated for consolidation under existing guidance the provisions of fin46 are to be applied immediately to vies created after january 31 2003 and to vies in which aig obtains an interest after that date for vies in which aig holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 fin46 applies to the fiscal quarter ended september 30 2003 for any vie that must be consolidated under fin46 that were created before february 1 2003 the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie would be initially measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change beginning july 1 2003 aig is required to consolidate approximately 2 9 billion of assets and liabilities and record a one time cumulative accounting charge upon adoption of fin 46 which will not have a material effect on aigs results of operations of the 2 9 billion 1 2 billion relates to third party debt most of which arises from sale leaseback transactions involving aigs ilfc subsidiary the remaining 1 7 billion relates to other liabilities arising from affordable housing transactions involving aig sunamerica subsidiaries in addition aig may be required to consolidate certain other vies based on future guidance from fasb see also the discussion under special purpose vehicles included herein effective january 1 2003 aig adopted the recognition provision of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stock based compensation fas 123 this statement establishes the financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans such as aigs stock purchase plan stock option plan and stock incentive plan under the recognition provisions of fas 123 costs with respect to stock compensation are measured using the fair value of the shares subscribed or granted as at the date of grant recognized ratably over the vesting period such fair value is derived through an option pricing model statement of financial accounting standards no 148 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to fasb statement no 123 fas 148 was issued in 2002 this statement amended fas 123 and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the recognition provisions of fas 123 also fas 148 amended certain of the disclosure requirements of fas 123 aig has elected the prospective method in the application of the recognition provisions as prescribed by fas 123 such method provides for the 64 recognition of the fair value with respect to stock based compensation for shares subscribed for or granted on or after january 1 2003 prior to adoption of the recognition provisions of fas 123 as amended aig recognized stock compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees with respect to net income for the six months and quarter ended june 30 2003 and 2002 the following table provides a pro forma reconciliation as if aig had adopted the recognition provisions of fas 123 at its inception in millions except per share amounts data table removed actual stock based compensation earnings per share impact is substantially less than one cent in may 2003 fasb issued financial accounting standard no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas 150 fas 150 requires certain financial instruments previously classified as either entirely equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the balance sheet be classified as liabilities fas 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities the following three types of freestanding financial instruments mandatory redeemable financial instruments obligations to repurchase the issuers equity shares by transferring assets and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares fas 150 is effective for the quarter ending september 30 2003 the impact of fas 150 on aigs results of operations and financial condition will be insignificant in july 2003 the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position 03 1 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop 03 1 fasb did not object to the issuance of sop 03 1 this statement is effective as of january 1 2004 and will require aig to recognize a liability for guaranteed minimum death benefits and other living benefits related to its variable annuity and variable life contracts and modify certain disclosures for these products aig is evaluating the provisions of sop 03 1 and does not currently have an estimate of the liability management believes with regard to its possible impact that the one time cumulative accounting charge upon adoption may have a material effect on aigs results of operations in the first quarter of 2004 but will not be material to aigs financial condition or liquidity recent developments on june 26 2003 aig announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire the ge edison life insurance company in japan and ges u s based auto and home insurance business for 2 15 billion the transaction which is subject to regulatory approvals in the u s and japan is expected to close in the third quarter of 2003 the board of directors of aig has increased the quarterly
