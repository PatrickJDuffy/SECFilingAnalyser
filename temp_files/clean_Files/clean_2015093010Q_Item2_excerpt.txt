underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product

month periods ended september 30 2015 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to lower net investment income in property casualty and institutional markets which was primarily due to lower alternative investment income performance consumer insurance pre tax operating income decreased in the three month period ended september 30 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting lower net investment income primarily due to alternative investment income performance and less favorable adjustments to reflect an update of actuarial assumptions compared to the same period in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by higher policy and advisory fees in the three month period ended september 30 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year driven by growth in separate account assets under management in retirement pre tax operating income decreased in the nine month period ended september 30 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the same factors as the three month period as well as lower base net investment income and less favorable mortality experience in life our investment portfolio performance declined in

executive overview market conditions and industry trends commercial insurance expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels currency volatility and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge growth of net investment income and limit growth and profitability in some markets due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry commercial insurance has continued to diversify its business focusing on growing profitable segments and geographies exiting unprofitable lines and developing advanced data and analytics to improve profitability property casualty property casualty has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges in the first half of 2015 the property casualty insurance industry experienced modest growth and an increase in overall exposures in certain markets although this growth may be leveling off property casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries but at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions as a result of its ongoing strategy to optimize its portfolio and maintain underwriting discipline property casualty expects that net premiums written for the u s casualty line will continue to decline through 2016 overall property casualty experienced a modest increase in rate pressure in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2015 property casualty expects that trend to continue in the near term particularly in certain lines including in the u s property excess and surplus market property casualty continues to differentiate its underwriting

the nine month period ended september 30 2015 the u s market experienced an increase in mortgage loan originations driven by a decrease in residential mortgage interest rates in the latter part of 2014 and increased purchase volume favorably impacted by a drop in unemployment improving housing prices and lower down payment requirements if the current economic environment persists mortgage guaranty expects to benefit through increased volume driven by purchase volume and for policies originated in the higher interest rate environment prior to 2012 refinancing activity mortgage guaranty also expects current interest rates to have a favorable impact on the persistency of business written during 2012 and the first half of 2013 since refinancing would be unattractive to homeowners who originated mortgages at the lower residential mortgage interest rates prevalent in that time period mortgage guaranty also expects that newly reported delinquencies will continue to decline during the remainder of 2015 and into 2016 mortgage guaranty believes the combination of the factors described above will result in favorable operating results for the remainder of 2015 and into 2016 on july 10 2014 the federal housing finance agency the conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac collectively the gses issued in draft form for public comment new eligibility requirements for private mortgage

30 2015 the new requirements which will be effective on december 31 2015 will mandate mortgage insurers to hold specified levels and types of assets in order to be able to pay a prescribed level of claims in certain stress scenarios the most significant change in the revision on june 30 2015 was a surcharge to the asset 86 table of contents item 2 executive overview requirement for lender paid mortgage insurance for mortgages originated after december 31 2015 mortgage guaranty will meet these requirements on the effective date these new requirements are not expected to have a material effect on aigs financial flexibility subject to interpretation and prospective amendment of the new requirements by the gses mortgage guaranty estimates its minimum required assets under pmiers would have been 3 1 billion as of september 30 2015 had the rules been in effect at that time and its estimated available assets would have exceeded the estimated required assets mortgage guarantys estimates may change depending on future interpretations or prospective amendments by the gses institutional markets institutional markets is expected to continue growing its assets under management

large limit property business where investments in client risk services and engineering are opening new opportunities with clients in this segment strategic growth property casualty continues to improve decision making risk acceptance and pricing based on its ongoing efforts to refine segmentation by customer industry and geography for example after enhancing the segmentation of workers compensation property casualty has observed different experience and trends which helps inform its risk appetite pricing and loss mitigation decisions as part of our strategic goal of diversifying product offerings and providing customers with greater access to unique insurance programs on march 31 2015 we paid approximately 239 million to acquire a controlling stake in nsm insurance group nsm

diversification of risk and increase capital efficiency within insurance entities to enhance return on equity market conditions and industry trends retirement increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement which continues to drive demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features in addition higher tax rates 88 table of contents item 2 executive overview and a desire for better investment returns have prompted less risk averse investors to seek products without guaranteed living benefits providing the opportunity to further diversify our product portfolio by offering investment focused variable annuities the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on investment returns which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products in addition more highly leveraged competitors have entered the market offering higher crediting rates as long as the low interest rate environment continues conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased surrenders customers are however currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment in april 2015 the u s department of labor dol issued a proposed regulation that substantially expands the range of activities that would be considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code this proposed regulation has generated substantial attention in our industry the dol has held public hearings on the proposal with the final public comment period for the proposed regulation having concluded in late september 2015 the proposal is subject to additional regulatory review and potential modification before the final regulation if any is adopted it is unknown at this time whether or how any final regulation may be different from that proposed if finalized as originally proposed the investment related information and support that our advisors and employees could provide to erisa covered plan sponsors participants and ira holders on a non fiduciary basis could be substantially limited from what is allowed under current law these changes could have a material impact on the types levels and compensation structures of the investment

data table removed for the three month period ended september 30 2015 the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was not meaningful due to a tax charge on a pre tax loss the tax charge was primarily due to increases in uncertain tax positions related to cross border financing transactions partially offset by tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest income and the partial completion of the internal revenue service examination covering tax year 2006 for the nine month period ended september 30 2015 the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 34 5 percent the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the nine month period ended september 30 2015 differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest income reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance previously released to accumulated other comprehensive income and the partial completion of the internal revenue service examination covering tax year 2006 partially offset by tax charges associated with increases in uncertain tax positions related to cross border financing transactions and increases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowances associated with certain foreign jurisdictions the nine month period ended september 30 2015 includes an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance primarily attributable to the effects of changes in the japanese tax law enacted on march

27 2 percent and 29 8 percent respectively the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations in both periods differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits

a pre tax loss in the three month period ended september 30 2015 compared to pre tax income in the same period in the prior year the decrease was primarily due to lower commercial insurance pre tax operating income which reflected lower net investment income and lower underwriting income and lower consumer insurance pre tax operating income which reflected lower net investment income and less favorable adjustments to reflect the update of actuarial assumptions partially offset by higher policy and advisory fees lower net realized capital gains from sales of investments and higher other than temporary impairment charges a decrease in non operating litigation reserves and settlements and restructuring and other costs also contributed to the decrease in pre tax income for the three month period ended september 31 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year these decreases were partially offset by lower loss on extinguishment of debt from ongoing liability management activities year to date pre tax income comparison for 2015 and 2014 pre tax income decreased in the nine month period ended september 30 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in commercial insurance pre tax operating income reflecting lower net investment income and lower underwriting income and a decrease in consumer insurance pre tax operating income

advisory fees as well as restructuring and other costs and lower income from divested businesses as a result of the sale of ilfc in the second quarter of 2014 these decreases were partially offset by a lower loss on extinguishment of debt from ongoing liability management activities and an increase from the change in the fair value of embedded policy derivatives related to variable annuity

discounting of reserves for further discussion investments overview our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit the investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for non life insurance companies life insurance companies and aig parent the primary objectives are generation of investment income preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities investments highlights during the nine months ended september 30 2015 a widening of credit spreads resulted in a decrease in our net unrealized gain position in our investment portfolio net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio decreased to approximately 13 0 billion as of september 30 2015 from approximately 19 0 billion as of december 31 2014 we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in commercial mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income although our alternative investments continue to generate higher returns than our fixed maturity securities portfolio our investment performance tapered in the third quarter of 2015 due to negative performance in the equity markets which affected the performance of our hedge fund portfolio blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called other than temporary impairments increased due to impairments within the energy and emerging markets sectors driven primarily by slowing growth in china and weakness in commodity markets investment strategies investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification 130 table of contents item 2 investments some of our key investment strategies are as follows fixed maturity securities held by the u s insurance companies included in non life insurance companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk return tax liquidity credit quality and diversification objectives outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by non life insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate while more of a focus is placed on asset liability management in life insurance companies our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics to the extent practicable aig parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and duration aig parents liquidity sources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded intermediate term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer term funding needs aig parent purchases publicly traded intermediate term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity investments the following tables summarize the composition of aig investments data table removed at both september 30 2015 and december 31 2014 approximately 90 percent and 10 percent of investments were held by domestic and foreign entities respectively 131 table of contents item 2 investments the following table presents the components of net investment income data table removed includes changes in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities where the fair value option has been elected and which are used to economically hedge the interest rate risk in gmwb embedded derivatives for the three month periods ended september 30 2015 and 2014 the net investment income loss recorded on these securities was 4 million and 32 million respectively for the nine month periods ended september 30 2015 and 2014 the net investment income loss recorded on these securities was 39 million and 162 million respectively net investment income decreased for the three month period ended september 30 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments lower reinvestment yields and lower income on investments for which the fair value option was elected net investment income decreased for the nine month period ended september 30 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments lower reinvestment yields and lower income on investments for which the fair value option was elected non life insurance companies for the non life insurance companies the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines as a result the investment strategy within the non life insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital subject to liability and other business considerations the non life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans while invested assets backing reserves of the non life insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields particularly in the domestic operations in addition we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset backed investments for their risk return attributes as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates this asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged we expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the non life insurance companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current riskreturn and tax objectives in addition the non life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio the non life insurance companies investment portfolio also includes to a lesser extent equity securities with respect to non affiliate overthecounter derivatives the non life insurance companies conduct business with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts the non life insurance companies have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically the non life insurance companies generally use isda master agreements and credit support annexes csas with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures fixed maturity investments of the non life insurance companies domestic operations with an intermediate duration of 4 7 years are currently comprised primarily of tax exempt securities which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns as 132 table of contents item 2 investments well as taxable municipal bonds government and agency bonds and corporate bonds the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings fixed maturity investments held in the non life insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings and short to intermediate duration averaging 3 3 years life insurance companies the investment strategy of the life insurance companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value subject to liquidity requirements capital constraints diversification requirements assetliability management and available investment opportunities the life insurance companies use assetliability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses the life insurance companies fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that to the extent possible complements the characteristics of liabilities including duration which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities and as a result certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses the life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans in addition the life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields the life insurance companies investment portfolio also includes to a lesser extent equity securities and yield enhancing investments the life insurance companies monitor fixed income markets including the level of interest rates credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve the life insurance companies frequently review their interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for their new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment the low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price attractive guaranteed return products and puts margin pressure on existing products due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity in addition there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain inforce business specifically the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities fixed maturity investments of the life insurance companies domestic operations with an intermediate duration of 6 5 years are comprised of taxable corporate bonds as well as taxable municipal and government bonds and agency and nonagency structured securities the majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings fixed maturity investments held in the life insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings and intermediate to long duration averaging 12 9 years naic designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office svo of the national association of insurance companies naic evaluates the investments of u s insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called naic designations in general naic designations of 1 highest quality or 2 high quality include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade while naic designations of 3 through 6 generally include fixed maturity securities referred to 133 table of contents item 2 investments as below investment grade the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities including non agency rmbs and cmbs which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies the following tables summarize the ratings distribution of life insurance companies fixed maturity security

reporting requirements as prescribed by the naic gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including estimates for ibnr and loss expenses less estimated salvage and subrogation and applicable discount the non life insurance companies regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in pretax operating income because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase prior years estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease prior years estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development net loss

or permitted by new york pennsylvania and delaware new york rules generally do not permit non tabular discounting on ibnr and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to case reserves pennsylvania permits non tabular discounting of ibnr and commencing in 2013 approved variable discount rates determined using risk free rates based on the u s treasury forward yield curve plus a liquidity margin applicable to ibnr and case reserves delaware has permitted discounting on the same basis as the pennsylvania domiciled companies the net decrease in workers compensation discount in the three month period ended september 30 2015 of 77 million was due to a 61 million reduction for accident years 2014 and prior primarily from accretion of discount on reserves for the three month period ended september 30 2015 in addition decreases in the forward yield curve component of the discount rates resulted in a 61 million decrease in the loss reserve discount as treasury rates as of september 30 2015 generally decreased along the payout pattern horizon as compared to the prior periods partially offset by an increase in the credit spread these decreases were partially offset by the effects of the discount attributable to newly established reserves for accident year 2015 which increased the discount by 45 million in the three month period ended september 30 2015 the net increase in workers compensation discount in the nine month period ended september 30 2015 of 160 million was primarily due to the increase in forward yield curve rates used for discounting under the prescribed or permitted practices the 151 table of contents item 2 insurance reserves non life insurance companies increase in the forward yield curve component of the discount rates resulted in a 222 million increase in the loss reserve discount as treasury rates generally increased along the payout pattern horizon in the nine month period ended september 30 2015 in addition the effects of the discount attributable to newly established reserves for accident year 2015 increased the discount by 149 million in the nine month period ended september 30 2015 these increases were partially offset by a 211 million reduction for accident years 2014 and prior primarily from accretion of discount on reserves for the nine month period ended september 30 2015 on january 1 2014 the non life insurance companies merged their two internal pooling arrangements into one pool and changed the participation percentages of the pool members resulting in a reallocation of reserves from new york domiciled companies to those domiciled in pennsylvania and delaware as a result of these changes in the participation percentages and domiciliary states of the participants of the combined pool the non life insurance companies recognized a discount benefit of 110 million in the first quarter of 2014 quarterly reserving conclusion aig net loss reserves represent our best estimate of the liability for net losses and loss adjustment expenses as of september 30 2015 while we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely in future years and materially exceed our loss reserves as of september 30 2015 in our opinion such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves data table removed a see tables below for details of prior year development by business unit accident year and major class of business

development in determining the loss development from prior accident years aig analyzes and evaluates the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a large change either favorable or unfavorable as appropriate we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year as part of our reserving process we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues in the three month period ended september 30 2015 the adverse prior year loss reserve development was 191 million this was driven by adverse development from healthcare environmental 2004 ongoing and run off environmental partially offset by property excluding natural catastrophes both domestically and internationally the adverse prior year development in healthcare and environmental 2004 ongoing resulted from indications of the annual detailed valuation review dvr performed in the third quarter of 2015 for those lines healthcare was driven by deteriorating loss experience in accident years 2008 and subsequent characterized by additional large claims in various segments including hospitals physicians and surgeons nursing homes and pharmaceutical and medical products liability environmental was driven by adverse emergence in recent accident years and higher severity assumptions in the most recent accident years in the nine month period ended september 30 2015 the adverse prior year loss reserve development was 532 million which was driven by increased automobile claim severity in excess and primary casualty as well as adverse development from healthcare environmental 2004 ongoing run off environmental and asbestos and environmental 1986 and prior this was partially offset by property excluding natural catastrophes both domestically and internationally we have observed increases in both the frequency and severity of claims occurring in our primary and excess commercial automobile liability business since the recovery from the recent economic downturn which have significantly outpaced the rate increases implemented during the same time we believe a combination of factors are contributing to these increases such as a mix of business weighted towards excess auto liability for commercial trucking increased shipping activity potentially resulting in driver fatigue a greater incidence of claims involving multiple severe injuries and fatalities and the general increase in damage awards we continued to react to these trends as new information emerged including strengthening reserves during the annual dvr of the commercial automobile liability business in 2012 2013 and 2014 and through our selection of the current accident year loss ratios in addition we made interim increases to reserves in periods between the annual dvr in 2014 and 2015 the experience in accident years 2011 and subsequent has continued to deteriorate and the dvr conducted in the second quarter of 2015 resulted in an increase of commercial automobile liability reserves by 402 million for the nine month period ended september 30 2015 including 91 million for primary automobile and 311 million for excess automobile primarily in accident years 2011 through 2014 we recognized return additional premiums on loss sensitive business of 30 million and 93 million for the three month periods ended september 30 2015 and 2014

claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative

the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2014 included a net positive adjustment of 196 million in fixed annuities primarily due to better spreads than previously assumed in retirement income solutions there were offsetting updates to assumed investment fees modeled expenses and terminations resulting in no net adjustment to pre tax operating earnings in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2015 compared to a 14 million net positive adjustment in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2014 primarily due to the update of mortality assumptions in

revisions to mortality and surrender assumptions partially offset by decreased spread assumptions in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2014 a net positive adjustment in group

also reflected lower investment spread assumptions partially offset by more favorable than expected mortality as well as loss recognition expense of 39 million for certain discontinued long term care products primarily due to lower future premium assumptions these negative adjustments were partially offset by a decrease in certain group benefit claim reserves based on updated experience data a net negative adjustment of 135 million in the life operating segment in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2014 also included additions to reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees primarily due to lower investment spread and mortality assumptions which while higher than previously assumed were still within pricing assumptions as well as loss recognition expense the life operating segment recorded loss recognition expense of 39 million and 87 million in the three month periods ended september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively which reduced pre tax operating income in the respective periods to increase reserves for certain long term care business loss recognition expense is included in other reserve changes in the rollforward table presented in insurance reserves the loss recognition for both periods was primarily a result of lower future premium increase assumptions and in the 2014 period but to a lesser extent lower yield assumptions assumptions related to

equity and commodity prices residential and commercial real estate values interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange inflation and their levels of volatility we are engaged in a variety of insurance investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk directly and indirectly we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off balance sheet exposures the chief risk officer within each business is responsible for properly identifying these risks then ensuring that they are appropriately measured monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the chief market risk officer cmro the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk taking authorities defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables distinct from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function risk identification market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad external predominantly market observable risks financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations financial condition liquidity and capital each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk equity prices we are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares investments in private equity hedge funds and mutual funds exchange traded funds and other equity linked capital market instruments as well as equity linked insurance products including but not limited to index annuities variable annuities universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance residential and commercial real estate values our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments changes in residential commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential commercial mortgages residential commercial mortgagebacked securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential commercial mortgages trusts that include residential commercial real estate and or mortgages and residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments interest rates interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and resulting product changes will generally reduce the attractiveness of our insurance products in the marketplace conversely higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons however when rates rise quickly there can be a temporary asymmetric u s gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value which is largely reported in other comprehensive income and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities financial liabilities insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed

changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including but not limited to corporate bonds abs mortgage backed securities aig issued debt obligations credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments much like higher interest rates wider credit spreads mean more investment income in the longterm in 178 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management the short term quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities which is largely reported in other comprehensive income a precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the creditworthiness of bond obligors potentially resulting in default losses foreign exchange fx rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income assets and liabilities denominated in and significant capital deployed in a variety of currencies changes in fx rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions commodity prices changes in commodity prices the value of commodities can affect the valuation of publiclytraded commodities commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices inflation changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including aig issued debt obligations derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly via indexing or implicitly through medical costs or wage levels risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures at the firmwide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aigs risk appetite statement this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels under specific stress tests at the market risk level the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis in addition we continue to enhance economic u s gaap accounting and statutory capitalbased risk measures at the market risk level businessunit level and firmwide levels this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures we use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities a one basis point increase in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities and a one percent increase in price on equity securities scenario analysis scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in worldwide equity markets scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses stress testing stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of rmbs or cmbs during 2008 179 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management market risk sensitivities the following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed a at

value rather than the stock price as of the applicable date as we applied the equity method of accounting prior to the sale d the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag foreign currency denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated nonu s dollar assets less our consolidated nonu s dollar liabilities on a u s gaap basis we use a bottom up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level we manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency denominated debt issued by aig parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk including but not limited to the execution of cross currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt at the aig parent level we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits as a matter of general practice we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries however we may utilize either cross currency swaps or our foreign currency denominated debt as a net investment hedge of our capital in subsidiaries at september 30 2015 our five largest foreign currency net asset positions were denominated in british pounds canadian dollars euro hong kong dollars and japanese yen our foreign currency denominated net asset position at september 30 2015 increased by 1 0 billion or 8 4 percent compared to december 31 2014 the increase was mostly due to a 1 5 billion increase in our euro position primarily resulting from debt repurchases and hedging a 671 million increase in our japanese 180 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management yen position primarily resulting from debt hedging and unrealized appreciation of investments a 593 million increase in our hong kong dollar position primarily resulting from the non life insurance companies investment in picc p and c and a 186 million increase in our swiss franc position primarily resulting from debt repurchases and hedging these increases were partially offset by a 1 5 billion decrease in our british pound position primarily resulting from the unwinding of a cross currency swap and a 448 million decrease in our canadian dollar position primarily resulting from dividend hedging for illustrative purposes we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u s dollar the estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short term cash collateral or other financial obligations failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency reduced operating flexibility increased costs reputational harm and regulatory action aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash can be generated to meet the obligations as they come due aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a time horizon covering a period of up to one year we maintain a liquidity buffer designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions if we project that we will breach the tolerance we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions however the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements risk identification the following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short term financial obligations as they come due market monetization risk assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs cash flow mismatch risk discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls event funding risk additional funding is required as the result of a trigger event event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings a market event or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options financing risk we are unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions aig specific issues or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding risk measurement comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk we produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows in addition we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity 181 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management we use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure including coverage ratios coverage ratios measure the adequacy of a portfolio of assets to meet the forecasted net cash flow over a specified time horizon the portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon asset ratios asset ratios measure and track the quality of an entitys assets that can be used to raise liquidity over a specified period of time cash flow forecasts cash flow forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon stress testing coverage ratios and asset ratios are re measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows liquid assets and or other funding sources relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to aig parent and business unit risk committees the frequency content and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity based on its complexity risk profile activities and size critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in
