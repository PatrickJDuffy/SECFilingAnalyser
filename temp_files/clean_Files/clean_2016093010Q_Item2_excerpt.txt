table of contents the md and a is organized as follows data table removed 80 table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures use of non gaap measures throughout this md and a we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results some of the measurements we use are nongaap financial measures under sec rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the nongaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarlynamed measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and book value per common share excluding aoci and deferred tax assets dta are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in book value per common share book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding book value per common share excluding aoci and dta is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci and dta by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive overview section of this md and a return on equity after tax operating income excluding aoci and return on equity after tax operating income excluding aoci and dta are used to show the rate of return on shareholders equity we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in return on equity return on equity after tax operating income excluding aoci is derived by dividing actual or annualized after tax operating income attributable to aig by average aig shareholders equity excluding average aoci return on equity after tax operating income excluding aoci and dta is derived by dividing actual or annualized after tax operating income attributable to aig by average aig shareholders equity excluding average aoci and dta the reconciliation to return on equity the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive overview section of this md and a we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided in the results of operations section of this md and a on a consolidated basis 81 table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures after tax operating income attributable to aig is derived by excluding the following items from net income attributable to aig these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions and measures that we believe to be common to the industry for example certain ratios and other metrics described below exclude data table removed operating revenue excludes net realized capital gains losses income from non operating litigation settlements included in other income for gaap purposes and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits included in net investment income for gaap purposes we use the following operating performance measures within our commercial insurance and consumer insurance reportable segments as well as corporate and other commercial insurance consumer insurance personal insurance corporate and other united guaranty pretax operating income includes both underwriting income and loss and net investment income but excludes net realized capital gains and losses other income and expense net gain on the sale of nsm and non operating litigation reserves and settlements underwriting income and loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred acquisition expenses and general operating expenses ratios we along with most property and casualty insurance companies use the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss our ratios are calculated using the relevant information 82 table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures calculated under gaap and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact in excess of 10 million each catastrophes also include certain man made events such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the 10 million threshold we believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an on going basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of managements control we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results consumer insurance retirement and life corporate and other institutional markets pretax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from pretax income data table removed premiums and deposits includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies group benefit policies and lifecontingent payout annuities as well as deposits received on universal life investmenttype annuity contracts and mutual

increased in the three month period ended september 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher returns on alternative investments and an increase in fair value of assets accounted for under the fair value option partially offset by an increase in underwriting loss the increase in underwriting loss was driven primarily by higher catastrophe losses and higher net adverse prior year loss reserve development primarily from u s program business within specialty partially offset by favorable property development this impact was partially offset by lower general operating expenses lower acquisition costs and an improvement in the accident year loss ratio as adjusted reflecting lower severe losses compared to the same period in the prior year commercial

lower general operating expenses partially offset by lower returns on alternative investments in retirement and life corporate and other reported a higher pre tax operating loss in the three month period ended september 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a pre tax operating loss in institutional markets driven by loss recognition expense on certain payout

improved in the three month period ended september 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher returns on alternative investments our investment portfolio performance declined in the nine month period ended september 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields partially offset by an increase in invested assets and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected net realized capital losses increased in the three month period ended september 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher foreign exchange losses related to the weakening of the british pound following the brexit vote which more than offset lower other than temporary impairment charges and higher gains on the sale of securities we recorded net realized capital losses in the nine month period ended september 30 2016 primarily due to foreign exchange losses and impairments which were higher than the gain recognized on the sale of a portion of our holdings in peoples insurance company group of china limited and picc property and casualty company

investment income decreased to 10 5 billion in the nine month period ended september 30 2016 compared to 10 9 billion in the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields partially offset by an increase in invested assets and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected while corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations we continued to make investments in structured securities mortgage loans and other fixed income investments with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 19 6 billion as of september 30 2016 from approximately 8 8 billion as of december 31 2015 due to a decline in interest rates and a narrowing of credit spreads the overall credit rating of our fixed maturity securities portfolio remains

pursuant to securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act rule 10b5 1 repurchase plans from october 1 to november 2 2016 we have repurchased approximately 946 million of additional shares of aig common

november 2 2016 of 0 32 per share payable on december 22 2016 to shareholders of record on december 8 2016 strategic outlook industry trends our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates currency exchange rates credit and equity market conditions catastrophic claims events regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2016 characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates instability in the global equity markets volatile energy markets slowing growth in china and euro zone economies and the united kingdom the uk advisory referendum in which a majority voted for the uk to withdraw its membership in the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit the brexit vote has also affected the u s dollar british pound exchange rate increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro british pound and the japanese yen the major currencies and created volatility in the financial markets which may continue for some time interest rates remain low relative to historical levels and certain markets in which we operate are experiencing negative interest rates a sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable annuities and spread management strategies for our investment oriented products 92 table of contents item 2 executive overview for investment oriented products in our retirement and life operating segments and our institutional markets operations our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads using asset liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads lowering interest crediting rates can help offset the impact of lower investment yields but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment contractual minimum crediting rates and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre established intervals as a result the timing and extent of crediting rate decreases may differ from the corresponding declines in investment yields which could reduce our spreads and future profitability a sustained low interest rate environment may favorably affect surrender activity of contract holders whose contractual minimum crediting rates are above those currently available in the marketplace in addition customers are currently seeking fixed annuities with longer surrender charge periods in pursuit of higher returns which may help mitigate the increase of surrenders if interest rates rise rapidly in the future spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize dac and related reserves for investment oriented products if future profit assumptions change significantly we may be required to recalculate dac and related reserves and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income additionally for certain traditional long duration products for which we are unable to adjust interest rates including structured settlements and other payout annuities our future earnings may be reduced in a sustained low interest rate environment and we may be required to record additional reserves the impact of low interest rates on our commercial insurance segment is primarily on our long tail casualty line of business we expect limited impacts on our existing long tail casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities we do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long tail casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates however we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection for our commercial insurance segment and run off insurance lines reported within corporate and other sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers compensation and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves additionally sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense currency volatility in the first nine months of 2016 was acute compared to recent years as the british pound weakened considerably against the u s dollar although the japanese yen strengthened against the u s dollar in that period the euro also weakened modestly against the u s dollar such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations in particular growth trends in net premiums written reported in u s dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies the net effect on underwriting results however is significantly mitigated as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected these currencies may continue to fluctuate in either direction especially as a result of the uks expected exit from the eu and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in u s dollars as well as financial statement line item comparability see results of operations foreign currency impact results of operations segment results quarterly and year to date pre tax income comparison for

and over the longer term is summarized below see our 2015 annual report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses commercial insurance outlook and strategic initiatives market conditions and industry trends commercial insurance expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels currency volatility and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to limit growth and profitability in some markets and challenge growth of net investment income due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry commercial insurance has continued to diversify its business focusing on growing profitable segments and geographies exiting unprofitable lines and developing advanced data and analytics to improve profitability commercial insurance has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may partially offset the effect of current economic challenges in the first nine months of 2016 the property casualty insurance industry experienced growth in certain classes of business in property and financial lines commercial insurance also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will continue at a faster pace than in developed countries but at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions as a result of its ongoing strategy to optimize its portfolio and maintain underwriting discipline commercial insurance expects that net premiums written for the u s casualty line and to a lesser extent certain lines within specialty and property will continue to decrease throughout the remainder of the year in addition the brexit referendum may negatively affect premium production in the european market both on a reported basis and in original currency overall commercial insurance experienced a modest increase in rate pressure in the first nine months of 2016 commercial insurance expects that trend to continue in the near term particularly in certain lines including in the u s property excess and surplus market commercial insurance continues to differentiate its underwriting capacity from its peers by leveraging its global footprint diverse product offering risk engineering expertise and significant underwriting experience 94 table of contents item 2 executive overview in the u s

engineering capabilities innovating new products and client risk solutions and delivering a better client experience customer our vision is to be our clients most valued insurer we expect that investments in underwriting claims services client risk solutions science and data will continue to differentiate us from our peers and drive a superior client experience for example during the fourth quarter of 2015 we increased global commercial property limits to 2 5 billion per occurrence from 1 5 billion in response to increased demand for capacity and services from clients managing complex global risks and increasing property values this increase was the result of recent investments in engineering and analytical capabilities which in turn allowed us to secure meaningful support from a panel of long standing reinsurers sharpen commercial focus exit or remediate targeted underperforming portfolios commercial insurance is focused on serving our clients by providing the products and services where we have the most potential to deliver value experience and emerging data indicate that there are consistently under performing sub segments of our business we will invest and grow where we see opportunity and we will exit or remediate underperforming portfolios for example in 2015 we transferred approximately 1 2 billion of loss reserves to our run off insurance lines and in the nine month period ended september 30 2016 we transferred another 1 3 billion this enables us to focus on growth opportunities while allowing for more proactive management of the transferred reserves by run off specialists we also did not renew certain accounts that did not meet our profit objectives in our casualty and property lines and to a lesser extent in our specialty lines we will continue to further enhance our risk selection process and refine technical pricing through enhanced tools and analytics to achieve this goal 95 table of contents item 2 executive overview drive efficiency narrow geographic footprint while continuing to maintain and improve multinational capabilities commercial insurance along with our other businesses continues to evaluate the markets and geographies that provide the greatest opportunities while maintaining the global footprint that our multinational clients greatly value additionally we will continue to leverage our various off shore centers taking advantage of opportunities to centralize and standardize processes and platforms we believe there is great opportunity to further streamline our global operating model expand and optimize the use of reinsurance and other risk mitigating strategies commercial insurance continues to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broadbased risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units implementing underwriting strategies to increase roe by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends commercial insurance remains focused on enhancing its global reinsurance strategy to improve overall capital efficiency although this strategy may lead to periodic income statement volatility in accordance with our strategic plan during the first quarter of 2016 we entered into a two year reinsurance arrangement with the swiss re group under which a proportional share of our new and renewal u s casualty portfolio is being ceded this arrangement is reducing the impact of the u s casualty loss ratio on our overall loss ratio accelerate micro segmentation of risks using internal and external data commercial insurance continues to

consumer insurance outlook and strategic initiatives market conditions and industry trends retirement increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement the strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space in response to the continued low interest rate environment which has added pressure to profit margins we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates in addition higher tax rates and a desire for better investment returns have prompted less risk averse investors to elect products without guaranteed living benefits the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on investment returns which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products although our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads in addition mutual insurance companies and more highly leveraged competitors are currently offering higher crediting rates as long as the low interest rate environment continues conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales but may also drive higher surrenders customers are however currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment in addition older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders are driving better than expected persistency low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices consumer insurance provides products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to restrictions imposed by erisa and the internal revenue code including rules that generally restrict the provision of investment advice by a fiduciary to erisa plans and participants and individual retirement accounts iras if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to the fiduciary individual advisor his or her firm or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen on april 8 2016 the dol published its final fiduciary duty rule the final rule substantially expanding the definition of fiduciary investment advice as a result the circumstances under which financial services providers

information on the final rule see part i item 2 md and a regulatory environment section of the quarterly report on form 10 q for the period ended march 31 2016 we are analyzing the final rules potential impact on our customers distribution partners financial advisors and us and preparing to implement the necessary adjustments to come into compliance with the final rule the final rule could require us and our competitors to make material changes to certain of our business practices and product designs and could materially affect our ability and the ability of our distribution partners and financial advisors to sell or service certain annuities and other investment products the initial compliance date of the final rule is april 10 2017 with full compliance required by january 1 2018

preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities investments highlights during the nine months ended september 30 2016 a decline in interest rates and narrowing of credit spreads resulted in an increase in our net unrealized gain position in our investment portfolio net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 19 6 billion as of september 30 2016 from approximately 8 8 billion as of december 31 2015 we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income during the nine months ended september 30 2016 we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by 2 7 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure our alternative investments portfolio performance also experienced a decline in the nine month period ended september 30 2016 due to increased volatility in equity markets primarily in the first quarter of 2016 blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called other than temporary impairments decreased due to lower impairments within the corporate bond portfolio primarily in the energy sector we recognized gains on sales of securities in the nine month period ended september 30 2016 primarily due to the sale of a portion of our picc investment the brexit vote has created increased volatility in exchange rates as well as within the equity markets which may continue for some time investment strategies investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification some of our key investment strategies are as follows fixed maturity securities held by the u s insurance companies included in non life insurance companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk return tax liquidity credit quality and diversification objectives 145 table of contents item 2 investments outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by non life insurance companies consist primarily of high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate while more of a focus is placed on asset liability management in life insurance companies our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics to the extent practicable aig parent included in corporate and other actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and duration aig parents liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer term funding needs aig parent purchases publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity investments by legal

guaranteed living benefits for the three month periods ended september 30 2016 and 2015 the net investment income loss recorded on these securities was 17 million and 4 million respectively for the nine month periods ended september 30 2016 and 2015 the net investment income loss recorded on these securities was 270 million and 39 million respectively net investment income increased for the three month period ended september 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher income on alternative investments and an increase in the fair market value of assets accounted for under the fair value option net investment income decreased for the nine month period ended september 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields partially offset by an increase in invested assets and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected non life insurance companies for the non life insurance companies the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines as a result the investment strategy within the non life insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital subject to liability and other business considerations the non life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans while invested assets backing reserves of the non life insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields particularly in the domestic operations in addition we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset backed investments for their risk return attributes as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates this asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged we expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the non life insurance companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current riskreturn and tax objectives in addition the non life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio fixed maturity investments of the non life insurance companies domestic operations with a duration of 4 7 years are currently comprised primarily of tax exempt securities which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds government and agency bonds and corporate bonds the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings 147 table of contents item 2 investments fixed maturity investments held in the non life insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings with a duration averaging 3 5 years life insurance companies the investment strategy of the life insurance companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value subject to liquidity requirements capital constraints diversification requirements assetliability management and available investment opportunities the life insurance companies use assetliability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses the life insurance companies fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that to the extent practicable complements the characteristics of liabilities including duration which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities and as a result certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio the life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans in addition the life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields while a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the life insurance companies we intend to reduce the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio the life insurance companies monitor fixed income markets including the level of interest rates credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve the life insurance companies frequently review their interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for their new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment the low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity in addition there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain inforce business specifically the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities fixed maturity investments of the life insurance companies domestic operations with a duration of 7 0 years are comprised of taxable corporate bonds as well as taxable municipal and government bonds and agency and nonagency structured securities the majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings fixed maturity investments held in the life insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings with a duration averaging 16 3 years naic designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office svo of the national association of insurance companies naic evaluates the investments of u s insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called naic designations in general naic

referred to 148 table of contents item 2 investments as below investment grade the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities including non agency rmbs and cmbs which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies

recognized on the sale of a portion of our picc investment compared to net realized capital gains in the same period in the prior year which were driven primarily by foreign exchange gains and net gains on the sales of various securities such as the class b shares of prudential financial inc and common shares of springleaf holdings inc foreign exchange gains losses were primarily due to 528

gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including estimates for ibnr and loss expenses less estimated salvage and subrogation and applicable discount the non life insurance companies regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in pretax operating income because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase prior years estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease prior years estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development see md and a critical accounting estimates details of the loss

arrangements each referred to here generically as deductibles primarily for u s commercial casualty business with respect to the deductible portion of the claim the non life insurance companies manage and pay the entire claim on behalf of the insured and are reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim the non life insurance companies held collateral of approximately 9 6 billion at both september 30 2016 and december 31 2015 for these deductible recoverable amounts consisting primarily of letters of credit and assets in trusts the following table classifies the

table removed u s workers compensation our non life insurance companies discount certain workers compensation reserves in accordance with practices prescribed or permitted by new york pennsylvania and delaware new york rules generally do not permit non tabular discounting on ibnr and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to case reserves pennsylvania permits non tabular discounting of ibnr and approved variable discount rates determined using risk free rates based on the u s treasury forward yield curve plus a liquidity margin applicable to ibnr and case reserves delaware has permitted discounting on the same basis as the pennsylvania domiciled companies 167 table of contents item 2 insurance reserves non life insurance companies the net decreases in workers compensation discount in the amounts of 32 million and 321 million respectively in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to the decrease in forward yield curve rates used for discounting under the prescribed or permitted practices the decrease in the forward yield curve component of the discount rates resulted in a 14 million and 295 million decrease in the loss reserve discount in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 compared to the prior year periods due to a decrease in treasury rates along the payout pattern horizon in addition there was a 55 million and 144 million reduction for accident years 2015 and prior for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 respectively primarily from accretion of discount on reserves for those periods this decrease was partially offset by a 37 million and 118 million addition for newly established reserves for accident year 2016 in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 respectively the impact of changes in treasury rates and credit spreads on workers compensation reserve discount generally is economically offset by unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities backing these reserves recorded in other comprehensive income resulting in a modest impact on our overall equity and book value per common share quarterly reserving conclusion aig net loss reserves represent our best estimate of the liability for net losses and loss adjustment expenses as of september 30 2016 while we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that our recorded loss reserves will not develop adversely in future years and materially exceed our loss reserves as of september 30 2016 in our opinion such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves data

quarterly and year to date net loss development net loss development in determining the loss development from prior accident years we consider and evaluate inputs from many sources including actual claims data the performance of prior reserve estimates observed industry trends our internal peer review processes including challenges and recommendations from our enterprise risk management group as well as the views of third party actuarial firms we use these sources to improve our evaluation techniques and to analyze and assess the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business our analyses produce a range of indications from various methods from which we select our best estimate we analyze and evaluate the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the lower or higher than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business in other cases the lower or higher than expected emergence may result in a change either favorable or unfavorable as appropriate we make adjustments in response to the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year as part of our reserving process we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues in particular those related to complex claims related class action litigation and latent exposure claims in the three month period ended september 30 2016 the adverse prior year loss reserve development was 273 million which was primarily driven by adverse development from our u s program business within specialty partially offset by property excluding catastrophes and consumer personal insurance the u s program prior year development was driven by higher than expected loss emergence in the most recent calendar year from a subset of the u s programs businesses which consists of both casualty and property lines written by managing general agencies mgas for which third party administrators handled the majority of the claims in the nine month period ended september 30 2016 the adverse prior year loss reserve development was 214 million which was primarily driven by program business in the u s domestic catastrophes and the florida court rulings described below partially offset by favorable development from property excluding catastrophes and consumer personal insurance during the second quarter of 2016 the florida supreme court issued two separate rulings that have increased the potential liability for workers compensation claims in that state by undoing certain aspects of regulations in place since 2003 the castellanos ruling eliminated statutory caps on claimant attorney fees in certain cases and the westphal ruling eliminated the 104 week limitation on temporary total disability benefits also in the second quarter the florida court of appeals issued the miles decision declaring unconstitutional certain restrictions on claimant paid attorney fees we have evaluated the potential impact of these decisions on our loss reserves and have recognized adverse prior year development for primary workers compensation in the nine month period ended september 30 2016 of approximately 100 million we are continuing to monitor the impact of these decisions and may adjust our estimate as new facts and data emerge in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2015 the adverse prior year loss reserve development was 191 million and 532 million respectively which was driven by increased automobile claim severity in excess and primary casualty as well as adverse development from asbestos and environmental 1986 and prior and run off environmental 1987 to 2004 this was partially offset by property excluding catastrophes both domestically and internationally we recognized additional premiums on loss sensitive business of 11 million and return premiums of 17 million for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 respectively which entirely offset development in that business we recognized return premiums on loss sensitive business of 30 million and 53 million for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2015 respectively which entirely offset favorable

theories of liability as described more fully in the 2015 annual report our reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect comprehensive groundup and top down analyses performed

longevity particularly on disabled lives on a block of structured settlements underwritten pre 2010 this legacy block accounted for over 80 percent of the charge recognized in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 these contracts are expected to become part of the legacy portfolio when our new operating structure is finalized compared to the legacy structured settlement contracts our more recently issued contracts contain a lower proportion of substandard business and those lives are less severely impaired on average there was no impact on pre tax operating income of institutional markets from the update of actuarial assumptions in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2015 variable annuity guaranteed benefit features and hedging program our retirement income solutions and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features which include gmwb and gmab the liabilities for gmwb and gmab are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates equity prices credit spreads and market volatility in addition to risk mitigating features in our variable annuity product design we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb and gmab including exposures to changes in interest rates equity prices credit spreads and volatilities the hedging program utilizes derivative instruments including but not limited to equity options futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election see enterprise risk management life insurance companies key insurance risks variable annuity risk management and hedging program in the 2015 annual report for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features impact on quarterly and year to date pre tax income changes in the fair value of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments are recorded in other realized capital gains losses realized capital gains losses as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of the fixed maturity securities used in the variable annuity hedging program for which the fair value option has been elected are excluded from pre tax operating income of the retirement operating segment the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting primarily due to differences between the gaap valuation of the embedded derivatives and the economic hedge target the non performance or own credit spread adjustment npa which adjusts the rate used to discount projected benefit cash flows for the gaap valuation of the embedded derivatives is excluded from the economic hedge target when corporate credit spreads widen the change in the npa generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a gain and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten the change in the npa generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a loss see differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target below 176 table of contents item 2 insurance reserves life insurance companies the following table presents the net increase decrease to consolidated pre tax income from changes in the fair value of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and related hedges data table removed in the three month period ended september 30 2016 gains from decreases in the fair value of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivative liabilities excluding the update of actuarial assumptions and the npa were more than offset by losses in the fair value of the related hedging portfolio primarily from equity hedges in the nine month period ended september 30 2016 losses from the increase in the fair value of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivative liabilities excluding the update of actuarial assumptions and the npa were primarily due to decreases in market interest rates and were significantly offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedging portfolio the update of actuarial assumptions in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 included net increases in both the economic hedge target and the embedded derivative liabilities which primarily reflected lower surrender and mortality assumptions partially offset by a decrease due to updated assumptions for utilization of withdrawal benefits the impact of these updated assumptions which were based on experience studies was less significant to the embedded derivative liabilities than to the economic hedge target because the discount rates used to value the embedded derivatives include the additional spread adjustment for the npa as well as other explicit risk margins in addition the increase in the embedded derivative liabilities from the assumption updates was partially offset by a reduction due to an update of these risk margins as a result the net increase in the gmwb and gmab embedded derivative liabilities from the update of assumptions was 19 million in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 the three month period ended september 30 2016 included losses from the change in the npa as a result of corporate credit spreads tightening however for the nine month period ended september 30 2016 widening in credit spreads resulted in a positive impact on pre tax income from the change in the npa although to a lesser extent than in the same period in the prior year in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2015 the impact of widening credit spreads resulted in gains from changes in the npa which were the primary driver of the net positive impact on pre tax income in those periods a decrease in market interest rates and lower equity market performance in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2015 resulted in increases in the gmwb and gmab embedded derivative liabilities in those period excluding the update of actuarial assumptions and the npa which were significantly offset by changes in the value of the hedging portfolio the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2015 included a net increase in the gmwb liabilities of 39 million due to the update of actuarial assumptions which reflected improved mortality lapse and withdrawal assumptions 177 table of contents item 2 insurance reserves life insurance companies the changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives excluding the update of actuarial assumptions and the npa were significantly offset in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 and 2015 by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option has been elected are used as a capital efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread related risk effective june 30 2015 we discontinued our u s treasury bond interest rate hedging program and initiated a corporate bond hedging program which is intended to provide the same capital efficiency as the previous u s treasury bond hedging program the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in the three month periods ended september 30 2016 and 2015 was not significant the nine month period ended september 30 2016 included gains from the change in fair value of the corporate bond hedging program primarily due to decreases in market interest rates the nine month period ended september 30 2015 reflected decreases primarily in the fair value of the u s treasury bond hedging program primarily due to increases in market interest rates in the first six months of 2015 the change in the fair value of the hedging bonds is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of income loss changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts which included swaps swaptions and futures resulted in gains in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 primarily due to decreasing market interest rates in the first six months of 2016 in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2015 gains in the three month period from decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of increases in rates in the first six months of 2015 the change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts which included futures and options resulted in losses in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 compared to gains in the same periods in the prior year due to more favorable change in equity market returns in the current year periods differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target which represents an estimate of the underlying economic drivers of the embedded derivatives the economic hedge target differs from the gaap valuation of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives due to the following rider fees are 100 percent included in the economic hedge target present value calculations the gaap valuation reflects those collected fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero actuarial assumptions for gaap are adjusted to remove explicit risk margins including margins for policyholder behavior mortality and volatility for valuing the present value of fees and use best estimate assumptions for the economic hedge target and npa is excluded from the discount rates used for the economic hedge target the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program the life insurance companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns which may be either positive or negative realized volatility versus implied volatility actual versus expected changes in the hedge target related to items not subject to hedging particularly policyholder behavior and risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge 178 table of contents item 2 insurance reserves life insurance

counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterpartys credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads we devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures these exposures may arise from but are not limited to fixed income investments equity securities deposits commercial paper investments reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements corporate and consumer loans leases reinsurance recoverables counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities collateral extended to counterparties insurance risk cessions to third parties financial guarantees and letters of credit we monitor and control our company wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations whether funded or unfunded to minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances we may require mitigants such as thirdparty guarantees reinsurance or collateral including commercial bank issued letters of credit and trust 195 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management collateral accounts we treat these guarantees reinsurance recoverables and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data we also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts see

due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers equity and commodity prices residential and commercial real estate values interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange inflation and their levels of volatility we are engaged in a variety of insurance investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk directly and indirectly we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off balance sheet exposures the chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks then ensuring that they are appropriately measured monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the chief market risk officer cmro the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk taking authorities defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables as opposed to from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function risk identification market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad external predominantly market observable risks financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations financial condition liquidity and capital each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk equity prices we are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares investments in private equity hedge funds and mutual funds exchange traded funds and other equity linked capital market instruments as well as equity linked insurance products including but not limited to index annuities variable annuities universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance residential and commercial real estate values our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments changes in residential commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential commercial mortgages residential commercial mortgagebacked securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential commercial mortgages trusts that include residential commercial real estate and or mortgages residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments interest rates interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make certain of our product offerings less attractive to investors conversely higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons however when rates rise quickly there can be a temporary asymmetric gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value which is largely reported in other comprehensive income and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities financial liabilities insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities variable annuities and derivative contracts 196 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management credit spreads credit spreads measure an instruments risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration defaultfree instrument changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including but not limited to corporate bonds abs mortgage backed securities aig issued debt obligations credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments much like higher interest rates wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the longterm in the short term quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities which is largely reported in other comprehensive income a precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the creditworthiness of bond obligors potentially resulting in default losses foreign exchange fx rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income assets and liabilities denominated in and significant capital deployed in a variety of currencies changes in fx rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions commodity prices changes in commodity prices the value of commodities can affect the valuation of publiclytraded commodities commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices we are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio inflation changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including aig issued debt obligations derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly via indexing or implicitly through medical costs or wage levels risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures at the firmwide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aigs risk appetite statement this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels at the market risk level the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis in addition we continue to use enhanced economic gaap accounting and statutory capitalbased risk measures at the market risk level businessunit level and firmwide levels this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures we use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities and a one percent increase in prices of equity securities scenario analysis scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in worldwide equity markets scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses stress testing stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of rmbs or cmbs during 2008 197 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management market risk sensitivities the following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed a at

excluded were 10 7 billion of loans and 3 6 billion of investments in life settlements in addition 4 8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations b the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag foreign currency denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated nonu s dollar assets less our consolidated nonu s dollar liabilities on a gaap basis we use a bottom up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level at the aig parent level we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits our foreign currency denominated net asset position at september 30 2016 decreased by 1 3 billion compared to december 31 2015 the decrease was mostly due to a 1 7 billion decrease in our hong kong dollar position primarily resulting from the sale of our non life insurance companies picc investment partially offset by a 286 million increase in our japanese yen position due to yen strengthening for illustrative purposes we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the 198 table

such events liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short term cash collateral or other financial obligations failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency reduced operating flexibility increased costs reputational harm and regulatory action aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due aig liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow it to meet its obligations over a twelve month horizon consistent with its risk appetite we maintain minimum levels for required liquidity and or minimum coverage ratios expected to ensure that our short term financial obligations are met under varying market conditions if we project that we will breach these tolerances we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions however the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements risk identification the following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short term financial obligations as they come due market monetization risk assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs or cause us to realize losses exceeding our expectations cash flow mismatch risk discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls event funding risk additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings a market event or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options financing risk we may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions aig specific issues or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding risk measurement comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk we produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows in addition we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity 199 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management we use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure including target liquidity range target liquidity range specifies the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a twelve month horizon under stressed liquidity conditions coverage ratios coverage ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon the portfolio of potential assets to be monetized is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon cash flow forecasts cash flow forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon stress testing coverage ratios are re measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows liquid assets and or other funding sources relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to aig parent and business unit risk committees the frequency content and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity based on its complexity risk profile activities and size critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment data table removed these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used our consolidated financial condition results of 200 table

the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb issued for public comment a notice of proposed rulemaking npr on enhanced prudential standards that would require insurer nonbank sifis such as aig to comply with a corporate governance and risk management standard and a liquidity risk management standard these proposed standards build on the frbs current guidance for large financial institutions supervised by the frb and have been tailored to insurance companies the comment period has now closed and we anticipate that the frb will adopt a final rule in due course after evaluating all comments received under the proposal the insurer nonbank sifis would have at least twelve months to comply on june 3 2016 the frb also released for public comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr outlining two conceptual insurance group capital frameworks that could apply to insurance groups supervised by the frba building block approach proposed for insurance institutions that are savings and loan holding companies or bank holding companies by virtue of owning depository institutions and a consolidated approach for insurer nonbank sifis such as aig in general the consolidated approach would consolidate an insurance companys assets and insurance liabilities into risk segments tailored to account for the liability structure and unique features of the insurance company apply risk factors to each segment and then set minimum capital requirements the anpr does not provide details on specific risk weights risk factors capital adequacy ratios and other important elements that could be applied to aig under the consolidated approach and we cannot predict how such an approach if applied to aig would affect our business results of operations financial condition or capital requirements the comment period has now closed and we anticipate that the frb will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking in due course after evaluating all comments received on june 23 2016
