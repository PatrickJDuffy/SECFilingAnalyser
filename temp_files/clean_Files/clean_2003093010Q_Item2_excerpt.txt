managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is designed to provide the reader a narrative with respect to aigs operations financial condition and liquidity and certain other significant matters index data table removed executive summary aigs operations are conducted principally through four business segments general insurance life insurance financial services and retirement services and asset management within each of these business segments are various operating groups generally formed based upon products or services which may be offered in different geographic locations throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aig presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful as well as most transparent gross premiums written statutory underwriting profit loss and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with aigs insurance competitors consolidated results aigs revenues in the first nine months of 2003 increased 18 4 percent to 59 12 billion when compared to 49 9 billion in the same period of 2002 growth in revenues was primarily attributable to the 28 growth in net premiums earned from the global insurance operations this growth was negatively impacted by realized capital losses incurred of 1 35 billion in 2003 compared to 1 46 billion in 2002 aigs income before income taxes and minority interest increased 16 6 percent in the first nine months of 2003 when compared to the same period of 2002 general insurance operating income was the primary reason for this growth similarly general insurance operating income was the primary factor in the 28 4 percent growth in aigs income before income taxes and minority interest for the third quarter of 2003 when compared to the third quarter of 2002 aigs effective income tax rates were 30 48 percent for net income and 33 58 percent for realized capital gains losses in 2003 compared to 30 53 percent and 34 76 percent respectively in 2002 aigs net income in the first nine months of 2003 increased 16 8 percent to 6 57 billion when compared to 5 62 billion in the same period of 2002 for the third quarter of 2003 aigs net income increased 26 9 percent to 2 34 billion when compared to 1 84 billion in the same period of 2002 for both the nine month and three month periods general insurance operating income as well as reduced realized capital losses overall were the primary factors for these increases over 2002 the following table summarizes the operations of each principal segment for the first nine months of 2003 and 2002 data table removed a represents the sum of net premiums earned net investment income and realized capital gains losses b represents the sum of gaap life premiums net investment income and realized capital gains losses c represents financial services commissions transactions and other fees d represents retirement services and asset management commissions and other fees general insurance general insurance operating income increased 32 7 percent in the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 general insurance operating income increased 47 4 percent in the third quarter of 2003 when compared to the same period of 2002 these significant increases were primarily attributable to strong growth in operating income with respect to domestic brokerage groups and foreign generals operations in addition the level of realized capital losses with respect to general insurance operations amounted to 331 million and 492 million for the first nine months of 2003 and 2002 respectively and 75 million and 210 million for the third quarter of 2003 and 2002 respectively life insurance life insurance operating income increased 10 6 percent in the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 this increase resulted from growth in each of aigs principal life insurance businesses partially offset by realized capital losses of 776 million and 601 million for the first nine months of 2003 and 2002 respectively financial services financial services operating income increased 12 3 percent in the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 reflecting profits derived from a diversified range of businesses and products retirement services and asset management retirement services and asset management operating income increased 13 5 percent in the first nine months of 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002 as a result of the upturn in the stock market and the improved economic outlook realized capital losses during the first nine months of 2003 and third quarter of 2003 aigs realized capital losses aggregated 1 35 billion and 360 million respectively these realized capital losses primarily reflect impairment loss provisions upon the ultimate disposition of these holdings a portion of these losses may be recovered depending on future market conditions capital resources at september 30 2003 aig had total capital funds of 68 17 billion and total borrowings of 76 74 billion at that date 67 66 billion of such borrowings were either not 29 guaranteed by aig or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements gias or matched notes and bonds payable during the period from january 1 2003 through september 30 2003 aig repurchased in the open market 3 322 500 shares of its common stock liquidity at september 30 2003 consolidated invested assets were 499 9 billion including 15 43 billion in cash and short term investments consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in the first nine months of 2003 amounted to 20 58 billion outlook premium rates in the general insurance business are continuing to strengthen both domestically and in key international markets along with policy restrictions and exclusions aig expects that rate increases will continue through 2003 such increases will positively impact on cash flow available for investment thus general insurances net investment income is expected to rise in future quarters even in the current low interest rate environment in the life insurance segment aig expects continued growth overall focused in its major product lines such as life insurance personal accident pension and investment products and group life health aig continues to expand its operations in china becoming the first foreign insurance organization to have wholly owned life insurance operations in beijing suzhou dongguan and jiangmen as well as previously established operations in shanghai foshan guangzhou and shenzhen aig also expects india korea and vietnam to offer additional opportunities for growth asia the largest region of foreign life had good operating income and premium growth in the first nine months of 2003 aig expects that ilfc will continue its growth and operating profitability as the airline industry recovery accelerates ilfc derives over 80 percent of its lease revenues from foreign carriers thus limiting its exposure to the domestic commercial aviation market which is more depressed than the rest of the industry aig is also optimistic about opportunities for growth in its consumer finance business both domestically and through continued expansion of overseas credit card operations and alternative distribution systems such as the use of the internet during 2003 aig also expects to expand its recently formed international retirement services operations aig has many promising growth initiatives underway around the world in its insurance and other operations cooperative agreements such as those in russia and with the peoples insurance company of china are expected to expand distribution networks for aigs products and investment opportunities critical accounting estimates aig considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts deferred policy acquisition costs and fair value determinations with respect to certain assets and liabilities of certain of the subsidiaries of aigs financial services operations these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used aigs results of operations would be directly impacted throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aigs critical accounting estimates are discussed in significant detail the major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below reserves for losses and loss expenses general insurance loss trend factors used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years expected loss ratios for the latest accident year i e accident year 2002 for the year end 2002 loss reserve analysis for low frequency high severity classes such as excess casualty and directors and officers liability expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years loss development factors used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate amount 30 future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts life insurance interest rates which vary by territory year of issuance and products mortality morbidity and surrender rates based upon actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy form restrictions exist with respect to the amount of current and prior operating income and current unrealized appreciation of investments which can inure to the benefit of aig such restrictions have been imposed by local insurance regulations in certain countries in which aig transacts business deferred policy acquisition costs general insurance life insurance and retirement services and asset management data table removed fair value determinations of certain assets and liabilities financial services valuation models utilizing factors such as market liquidity and current interest foreign exchange and volatility rates aig attempts to secure reliable and independent current market price data such as published exchange rates from external subscription services such as bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available aig uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the transactions operational review general insurance operations aigs general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the domestic brokerage group dbg which includes the hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company hsb transatlantic holdings inc transatlantic personal lines including 21st century insurance group 21st century and mortgage guaranty dbg is aigs primary domestic general division dbg writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers this provides dbg the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control any licensed broker is able to submit business to dbg without the traditional agent company contractual relationship but such broker usually has no authority to commit dbg to accept a risk transatlantic offers through its reinsurance company subsidiaries reinsurance capacity both domestically and overseas on treaty and facultative basis for a full range of property and casualty products personal lines engages in the mass marketing of personal lines insurance primarily private passenger auto and homeowners and personal umbrella coverages mortgage guaranty provides guaranty insurance primarily on conventional first mortgage loans on single family dwellings and condominiums aigs foreign general insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through american international underwriters aiu a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities the foreign general insurance group also includes business written by aigs foreign based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts the foreign general insurance group uses various marketing methods to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws customs and needs aiu operates in over 70 countries in asia the pacific rim europe africa middle east and latin america see also note 2 of notes to financial statements 31 as previously noted aig believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its investors accordingly in its general insurance business aig uses certain non gaap measures where aig has determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful a critical discipline of a successful general insurance business is the objective to produce operating income from underwriting exclusive of investment related income when underwriting is not profitable premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses and underwriting related expenses in these situations the addition of general insurance related investment income and realized capital gains may however enable a general insurance business to produce operating income if underwriting losses persist over extended periods an insurance company will likely not continue to exist as a going concern for these reasons aig views underwriting profit to be critical in the overall evaluation of performance although in and of itself not a gaap measurement aig believes this measurement is a useful and meaningful disclosure see also the discussion under liquidity herein general insurance operating income is comprised of underwriting profit net investment income and realized capital gains and losses these components as well as net premiums written net premiums earned and statutory ratios for the nine month periods ending september 30 2003 and 2002 were as follows data table removed general insurance results during the first nine months of 2003 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 29 0 percent and 32 9 percent respectively from those of 2002 commencing in the latter part of 1999 and continuing through and into the current quarter the commercial property casualty market place has experienced rate increases virtually all areas of dbg have experienced rate increases as well as maintaining an excellent retention rate for desired renewal business the vast majority of the increase in the first nine months of 2003 resulted from rate increases with respect to renewed business overall dbgs net premiums written increased 3 70 billion or 33 6 percent in the first nine months of 2003 over 2002 adjusting this growth for cancelled or non renewed business such growth would have approximated 40 percent personal lines net premiums written increased 14 1 percent or 335 million in the first nine 32 months of 2003 from 2002 reflecting auto insurance rate increases in many states foreign general insurance net premiums written increased 25 6 percent and net premiums earned increased 30 8 percent in the first nine months of 2003 when compared to the same period of 2002 net premiums written growth was most significant in continental europe and the united kingdom the product lines that had significant growth were excess casualty and financial lines in comparing the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of aigs foreign general operations during the first nine months of 2003 to those average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate aigs foreign general results during the same period of 2002 the u s dollar weakened slightly in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly when foreign net premiums written were translated into u s dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 1 8 percentage points more than they would have been if translated utilizing those average foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during that same period of 2002 net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period aig along with most general insurance entities uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance the loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss the domestic and foreign combined ratios improved over last years primarily due to the growth in net premiums exceeding the growth in expenses as well as heightened expense control underwriting profit is measured in two ways statutory underwriting profit and generally accepted accounting principles gaap underwriting profit statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting differs from gaap as statutory accounting in general requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes expenses are recognized immediately not over the same period that the revenues are earned a basic premise of gaap accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the principle of matching therefore to convert underwriting results to a gaap basis acquisition expenses are deferred deferred policy acquisition costs dac and amortized over the period the related premiums written are earned accordingly statutory underwriting profit is adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by gaap dac is reviewed for recoverability and such review requires management judgment the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity regulation product type and competition have a direct impact on pricing and consequently profitability as reflected by underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios the effects of catastrophes incurred in the first nine months of 2003 and 2002 were insignificant with respect to catastrophe losses aig believes that it has taken appropriate steps to reduce the magnitude of possible future losses the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity such as a terrorist attack earthquake or hurricane that causes insured losses however could have a material adverse effect on aigs results of operations liquidity or financial condition current techniques and models may not accurately predict in the future the probability of catastrophic events and the extent of the resulting losses moreover one or more catastrophe losses 33 could impact negatively aigs reinsurers and result in an inability of aig to collect reinsurance recoverables the impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from period to period making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult general insurance net investment income in the first nine months of 2003 increased 8 2 percent when compared to the same period of 2002 the invested cash flow resulting from the growth in net premiums written in this and prior periods had a positive impact on net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein general insurance realized capital losses were 331 million and 492 million in the first nine months of 2003 and 2002 respectively these realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and reflect continued weakness in the equity markets and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings see the discussion on valuation of invested assets herein general insurance operating income for the first nine months of 2003 increased 32 7 percent to 3 60 billion the contribution of general insurance operating income to aigs consolidated income before income taxes and minority interest was 36 5 percent during the first nine months of 2003 compared to 32 1 percent in the same period of 2002 reinsurance aig is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations aig is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs aig insures general risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide aig the level of reinsurance protection that aig desires these reinsurance arrangements do not relieve aig from its direct obligations to its insureds aigs general reinsurance assets amounted to 31 68 billion at september 30 2003 and resulted from aigs reinsurance arrangements thus a credit exposure existed at september 30 2003 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse aig under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements aig manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and when necessary aig holds substantial collateral in the form of funds securities and or irrevocable letters of credit this collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis at december 31 2002 approximately 40 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers in order to obtain statutory recognition the majority of these balances were collateralized the remaining 60 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 90 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated a excellent or better as rated by a m best through september 30 2003 these distribution percentages have not changed significantly this rating is a measure of financial strength the terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories not creditworthiness aigs allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance has not changed significantly from december 31 2002 when aig had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating 120 million at september 30 2003 aig had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled e g liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction aigs reinsurance security department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic such assessments include but are not limited to identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates this department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral in addition aigs credit risk committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer aig enters into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for its general and life operations aig enters these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among various legal entities these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation at september 30 2003 the general reinsurance assets of 31 68 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of 4 11 billion and 23 36 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses including 34 ceded losses incurred but not reported ibnr ceded reserves the ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments thereto are reflected in income currently it is aigs belief that the ceded reserves at september 30 2003 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable in the future as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses the table below classifies as of september 30 2003 the components of the general insurance reserve for losses and loss expenses loss reserves with respect to major lines of business on a statutory basis data table removed presented pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners these loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including ibnr and loss expenses certain of these loss reserves are discounted these discounted reserves relate primarily to certain workers compensation claims at september 30 2003 general insurance net loss reserves increased 4 35 billion from prior year end to 35 09 billion the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently it is managements belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at september 30 2003 there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of september 30 2003 in the future if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations in a very broad sense the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups one group being long tail casualty lines of business such lines include excess and umbrella liability directors and officers liability professional liability medical malpractice general liability products liability and related classes the other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses net losses for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors including the line and volume of the business involved in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses that is a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid a relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be ibnr aigs carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses carried for long tail casualty lines these methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next for the majority of long tail casualty lines net loss trend factors approximated six percent loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling exposure and policy forms current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted as appropriate to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience thus many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs recognized a number of actuarial assumptions are made in the review of reserves for each individual segment 35 for segments in longer tail lines of business actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following 1 loss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years 2 expected loss ratios for the latest accident year i e accident year 2002 for the year end 2002 loss reserve analysis and in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years adjusted for the loss trend see 1 above and the impact of rate changes and other quantifiable factors for low frequency high severity classes such as excess casualty and directors and officers liability d and o expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years 3 loss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis aig records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its many general insurance profit centers the overall change in aigs loss reserves is based on the sum of these profit center level changes for most profit centers which write longer tail classes of casualty coverage the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage this loss ratio is multiplied by the current quarters net earned premium for that class of coverage to determine the quarters total estimated net incurred loss and loss expense the change in loss reserves for the quarter for each class is thus the difference between the net incurred loss and loss expense estimated as described above and the net paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter the process of determining the current loss ratio for each class or business segment begins in the profit centers in the latter part of the previous year the loss ratios determined for each profit center are based on a variety of factors these include but are not limited to the following considerations prior accident year and policy year loss ratios actual and anticipated rate changes actual and anticipated changes in coverage reinsurance or mix of business actual and anticipated changes in external factors impacting results such as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment each profit centers loss ratio for the following year is subject to review by the profit centers management by actuarial and accounting staff and ultimately by senior management at the close of each quarter the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios based thereon remain appropriate this process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter actual rate changes achieved actual changes in coverage reinsurance or mix of business and changes in all other factors that may affect the loss ratio when this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate the loss ratio for current business would be changed to reflect the revised assumptions for profit centers or business segments writing short tail coverages such as property coverages the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes is geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve level for the outstanding exposure rather than determining an expected loss ratio for current business for example the ibnr reserve required for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest years earned premium and this level of reserve would be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the current quarter the 20 percent factor would be adjusted to reflect changes in rate levels loss reporting patterns known exposures to large unreported losses or other factors affecting the particular class of business a comprehensive annual loss reserve review is conducted in the fourth quarter of each year for each aig general insurance subsidiary these reviews are conducted in full detail for each class or segment of business for each subsidiary and thus consist of literally hundreds of individual analyses the purpose of these reviews is to confirm the reasonableness of the reserves carried by each of the individual subsidiaries and thereby of aigs overall carried reserves the reserve analysis for each business segment or class is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that segments business in completing these detailed actuarial reserve analyses the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions including for example the 36 selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors they are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial method s to employ for each business segment additionally they must determine the appropriate segmentation of data or segments from which the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately tested in the course of these detailed reserve reviews for each business segment a point estimate of the loss reserve is generally determined the sum of these point estimates for each of the individual business segments for each subsidiary provides an overall actuarial point estimate of the loss reserve for that subsidiary the overall actuarial point estimate is compared to the subsidiarys carried loss reserve if the carried reserve can be supported by actuarial methods and assumptions which are also believed to be reasonable then the carried reserve would generally be considered reasonable and no adjustment would be considered the ultimate process by which the actual carried reserves are determined considers not only the actuarial point estimate but a myriad of other factors other crucial internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions in the united states and abroad changes in the legal regulatory judicial and social environments underlying policy pricing terms and conditions and claims handling in the 2002 year end actuarial loss reserve analysis for dbg the more recent accident years showed significant increases in loss development for the excess casualty and directors and officers liability classes as well as lesser amounts in certain other classes including healthcare liability as a result the actuaries performing the loss reserve analyses for these classes modified their historical assumptions in producing the point estimate of required reserves a key modification was to give additional weight to the actual loss development in the immature years for example for the excess casualty lead umbrella segment the actual loss developments for accident year 1999 were used even though that development normally would have been considered too immature to produce reliable results and therefore not used under historical assumptions another key change for the most recent accident years generally accident years 2000 2001 and 2002 was although the actuaries continued to use actuarial assumptions that rely on expected loss ratios based on the results of prior accident years the expected loss ratio assumptions used gave far greater weight to more recent accident year experience than was the case in the historical assumptions thus for the excess casualty lead umbrella segment described above the actuaries gave 100 percent weight to the results of the 1997 through 1999 accident years only giving no weight to the more favorable development of all prior years in setting expected loss ratio assumptions for accident years 2000 to 2002 again using the lead umbrella segment as an example rather than using the historical loss trend factor of 2 5 percent per year as actually experienced the actuaries used 7 5 percent as the annual loss cost trend factor reflecting the more current experience as a result of the modified assumptions the actuaries developed a second point estimate of the net loss reserve for dbg loss development trends for long tail lines such as excess casualty and d and o however have not followed any consistent trend this has at times led to overstated loss ratio projections and is a key reason why the actuaries have customarily utilized the historical projection method which gave more weight to the experience of older more mature accident years for long tail lines judgment is required in analyzing the appropriate weighting of current trends to avoid overreacting to data anomalies that may distort such current trends given the accuracy of the historical approach and the uncertainty of the more recent trends aig management decided to give approximately equal weight to the point estimate of the required reserve resulting from the historical assumptions and the point estimate of the required reserve from the modified assumptions described above in determining the actual loss reserve carried at year end 2002 aigs annual loss reserve does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates because aigs general insurance business is primarily in long tail casualty lines driven almost entirely by severity rather than frequency of claims developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful an estimate is calculated which aigs actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve this amount is evaluated against actual carried reserves it must be understood that there is the potential for significant variation in the actual results versus the assumptions used to test the reserves particularly for the long tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty as an 37 example for the lead umbrella segment of the excess casualty class of business a 5 percent change in the assumed loss cost trend from each accident year to the next would cause approximately a 300 million impact either positively or negatively in the net loss and loss expense reserve position for that segment as noted above the modified assumptions used in the year end 2002 loss reserve review adjusted the loss trend assumption from the historical 2 5 percent to 7 5 percent thus this change in assumptions caused approximately a 300 million change in the overall aig loss reserve position in the early 1990s actual loss cost trends were negative for the excess casualty class whereas in the late 1990s they spiked significantly and ran well into the double digits thus while the 7 5 percent assumption used in the modified assumptions for year end 2002 is believed to be reasonable there can be no assurance that actual loss trends will not deviate significantly from this assumption another key assumption for long tail classes such as excess casualty is the loss development factors which are utilized to project the reported losses for each year to an ultimate basis generally actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development however there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past again using the excess casualty class as an example if future loss development factors differed by 5 percent from those utilized in the year end 2002 loss reserve review there would be approximately a 200 million impact to the overall aig loss reserve position asbestos and environmental claims aig continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste hazardous substances and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years aig established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claim units which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims these units utilize a comprehensive ground up approach to claim adjusting by thoroughly evaluating each exposure on a claim by claim basis commencing in 1985 standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented however aig currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process these asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques previously described quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage the current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future additionally the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties in the interim aig and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues at the current time it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage as they have in the past as well as by the changes in superfund and waste dump site coverage issues although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims the reserves carried for these claims at september 30 2003 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law furthermore as aigs net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves in the future if the environmental claims develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations see the 38 previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein the majority of aigs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages not primary coverages thus the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves that is litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability aig incurs individual significant claim liabilities where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable are established on a case basis in asbestos for example aig has resolved all claims with respect to miners and product manufacturers tier i for which payments are completed or reserves are established to cover future payment obligations asbestos claims with respect to products containing asbestos tier 2 accounts are generally very mature losses and have been appropriately recognized and reserved by aigs asbestos claims operation aig believes that the vast majority of the incoming claims with respect to products containing small amounts of asbestos and companies in the distribution chain and parties with remote ill defined involvement with asbestos tier 3 and 4 should not impact its coverage this is due to a combination of factors including the increasingly peripheral companies being named in asbestos litigation smaller limits issued to peripheral defendants tenuous liability cases against peripheral defendants attachment points of the excess policies and the manner in which resolution of these weaker cases would be allocated among all insurers including non aig companies over a long period of time a summary of reserve activity for the nine months ended september 30 2003 and 2002 including estimates for applicable ibnr relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined is as follows data table removed all amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years the gross and net ibnr included in the aforementioned reserve for losses and loss expenses at september 30 2003 and december 31 2002 were estimated as follows data table removed a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity for the nine month periods ended september 30 2003 and 2002 was as follows data table removed a m best an insurance rating agency has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that companys current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments this is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the 39 average annual payments for the prior three years therefore the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments the higher the ratio the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments these ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments it should be noted however that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio the developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments court orders covered claims with no coverage defenses state mandated cleanup costs claims where aigs coverage defenses are minimal and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting also aig considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary aig believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio the special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages aigs asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites as a result aig reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies aigs survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at september 30 2003 and 2002 were as follows data table removed aigs operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states as a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state aig generally records these assessments upon notice additionally certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities therefore the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated the guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2002 were 76 million based upon current information aig does not anticipate that its net assessment will be significantly different in 2003 aig is also required to participate in various involuntary pools principally workers compensation business which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets this participation is also recorded upon notification as these amounts cannot be reasonably estimated life insurance operations aigs life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products traditional products consist of individual and group life annuity endowment and accident and health policies financial and investment products consist of fixed

distribution channels b amounts presented were as at september 30 2003 and december 31 2002 c amounts presented do not reflect acquisition of aig edison life insurance company in japan life insurance results life insurance operating income increased 10 6 percent to 4 20 billion during the first nine months of 2003 when compared to the same period last year the contribution of life insurance operating income to aigs consolidated income before income taxes and minority interest amounted to 42 6 percent during the first nine months of 2003 compared to 44 9 percent in the same period of 2002 contributing to the groups performance were improved profit margins resulting from expense reductions redeployment of invested assets achieving increased yields monitoring of crediting rates to maintain margins and increased production of protection policies in asia aigs gaap life premiums during the first nine months of 2003 increased by 1 53 billion representing a 10 2 percent increase from the same period in 2002 domestically the growth is predominantly attributable to the pension and investment products which include structured settlements life insurance and group life health with respect to the foreign life segment the majority of the growth was attributable to the life insurance and personal accident lines of business this growth was most significant in southeast asia where aig maintains significant market share established by its strong agency force and in japan where aig is benefiting from a flight to quality foreign life operations produced 77 0 percent and 76 6 percent of aigs consolidated gaap life premiums in 2003 and 2002 respectively new cash flows from guaranteed investment contract gic sales were lower for the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in 2002 which is attributable to the opportunistic nature of the business and that aig subsidiaries only issue gics when interest rate spreads are favorable 41 while this has an impact on overall cash flow there is an immaterial impact on life gaap premiums net investment income and operating income the traditional life products particularly individual life products as well as personal accident were major contributors to the growth in foreign premiums these traditional life products coupled with the increased distribution of financial and investment products contributed to the growth in foreign investment income a mixture of traditional accident and health and financial products are being sold in japan through alico and aig star life since aig purchased aig star life a part of income earned by aig star life has resulted from surrender charges earned on policies that were either surrendered or lapsed this favorable impact on operating income was anticipated when aig took control as these surrenders diminish in subsequent periods operating income from that source will also be impacted the majority of aig star lifes future income is expected to be related to continuing premiums paid on renewal business and new business to be generated from a growing agency force as previously discussed the u s dollar weakened slightly in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly for the first nine months of 2003 when foreign life premiums were translated into u s dollars for purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total life premiums were approximately 1 9 percentage points more than they would have been if translated utilizing average exchange rates prevailing in 2002 life insurance net investment income increased 10 2 percent during the first nine months of 2003 the growth in net investment income was attributable to both foreign and domestic invested new cash flow for investment as well as returns on nontraditional investments this cash flow was generated from life insurance operations and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein life insurance realized capital losses for the first nine months were 776 million in 2003 and 601 million in 2002 these realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing management of the life insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and reflect continued weakness in the equity markets and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings see the discussion on valuation of invested assets herein underwriting and investment risk the risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk the risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is primarily investment risk underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality morbidity termination and expenses aigs foreign life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately 1 5 million of coverage and aigs domestic life companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to 2 5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance the investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets primarily long term fixed rate investments being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments to minimize its exposure to investment risk aig tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit if a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur a demand could be placed upon liquidity see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs foreign operations as it has been throughout aigs history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities for example in japan and several southeast asia territories the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities additionally there exists a future investment risk 42 associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts while continuing to maintain satisfactory investment quality to the extent permitted under local regulation aig may invest in qualified longer term securities outside japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield aig is able to manage any asset liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs domestic operations as there is ample supply of qualified long term investments aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes for the alico operations in japan the variable life contract separate account fund performance has varied from the level assumed in the original pricing of the product thus a general account liability has been established for the potential shortfall of future contract revenues the ultimate liability is predominately dependent upon the fund performance in the future deferred policy acquisition costs dac for life insurance products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new or renewal business policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy policy acquisition costs which relate to universal life and investment type products non traditional life products are deferred and amortized with interest in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less interest required as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the impact on the amortization of dac the estimation of projected gross profits requires significant management judgment the elements with respect to the current and projected gross profits are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are appropriately adjusted dac for both traditional life and non traditional life products are subject to review for recoverability which involve estimating the future profitability of current business this review also involves significant management judgment financial services operations aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft

the first nine months of 2003 over the same period of 2002 financial services operating income represented 17 9 percent of aigs consolidated income before income taxes and minority interest in the first nine months of 2003 this compares to 18 6 percent in the same period of 2002 ilfc generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account for airlines and for financial institutions revenues in the first nine months of 2003 increased 8 4 percent from the same period of 2002 the revenue growth resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment under operating lease and the increase in the relative cost of the leased fleet ilfc has historically derived over 80 percent of its lease revenues with respect to flight equipment from airlines based outside the united states and is not significantly exposed to current domestic airline difficulties passenger miles in asia a major market for ilfc have increased substantially as the risk of sars has abated ilfc typically contracts to re lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term for aircraft returned before the end of the lease term ilfc has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return while some of the lease rates for aircraft that have been redeployed are lower this is partially offset by low interest rates which reduce ilfcs financing costs as a lessor ilfc considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent there were no aircraft off lease at september 30 2003 all new aircraft deliveries in 2003 and 2004 have been leased at the conclusion of the third quarter ilfc entered into a securitization of a portfolio of 37 aircraft of which nine are to be transferred into this securitization subsequent to september 30 2003 certain of aigs life insurance and retirement services businesses purchased a large share of this securitization this transaction had an insignificant impact on the results of the consolidated operations of aig ilfc management is very active in the airline industry management formally reviews regularly and no less frequently than quarterly issues affecting ilfcs fleet including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft values management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary based on these events and circumstances in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 144 ilfc has not recognized any impairment related to its fleet as the existing service potential of the aircraft in ilfcs portfolio has not been diminished further ilfc has been able to re lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates to an extent that would require an impairment write down see also the discussions under liquidity herein during the first nine months of 2003 ilfcs operating income decreased 6 7 percent from the same period of 2002 principally due to the impact of 44 certain bankruptcy and other settlements received in 2002 ilfc finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments the composite borrowing rates at the end of the first nine months of 2003 and 2002 were 4 63 percent and 4 95 percent respectively see also the discussions under capital resources and liquidity herein and note 2 of notes to financial statements ilfc is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through non performance of aircraft lessees through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease ilfc manages its lessee non performance exposure through credit reviews and security deposit requirements as a result of these measures and its own contingency planning ilfc did not suffer any material losses from airline shutdowns in the aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks but there can be no assurance that ilfc will successfully manage the risks relating to the impact of possible future deterioration in the airline industry approximately 88 percent of ilfcs fleet is leased to non u s carriers and this fleet the most efficient in the airline industry continues to be in high demand from carriers see also the discussions under capital resources and liquidity herein aigfp and aigtg derive substantially all their revenues from proprietary positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions aigfp and aigtg participate in the derivatives dealer market conducting primarily as principal an interest rate currency equity commodity and credit derivative products business as dealers aigfp and aigtg mark their transactions daily to fair value thus a gain or loss on each transaction is recognized daily aigfp and aigtg hedge the market risks arising from their transactions therefore revenues and operating income are not significantly exposed to or affected by market fluctuations and volatility revenues of aigfp and aigtg and the percentage change in revenues for any given period are significantly affected by the number and size of transactions entered into by aigfp and aigtg during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period operating income and the percentage change in operating income for any period are determined by the number size and profitability of the transactions attributable to that period relative to those attributable to the prior period generally the realization of operating income as measured by the receipt of funds over the course of time is not a significant reporting event as the profit or loss on aigfps and aigtgs derivatives transactions have already been reflected in operating income at fair value at the inception capital markets revenues in the first nine months of 2003 increased 20 0 percent from the same period of 2002 during the first nine months of 2003 operating income increased 23 1 percent from the same period of 2002 such increases in revenues and operating income were attributable to aigfps interest rate business segment as aigfp and aigtg are transaction oriented operations current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance the breakdown by percentage contribution of revenues and operating income for aigfp and aigtg in the first nine months of 2003 and 2002 is set forth below the percentages for operating income are the same as those for revenues because expenses are allocated across all products in proportion to the revenues generated by that product material changes in the distribution of revenues and operating income from period to period are not unusual due to the transactional nature of aigfps and aigtgs business data table removed derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of aigfps and aigtgs business therefore income on interest rate equity commodity and credit derivatives along with their related hedges are recorded on a mark to market value or at estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the income statement in the current year in the first nine months of 2003 less than five percent of revenues resulted from transactions valued at estimated fair value the mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the captions unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions and unrealized loss on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions the unrealized gain represents the 45 aggregate of each net receivable by counterparty and the unrealized loss represents the aggregate of each net payable by counterparty these amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates currency rates equity prices and other market variables as well as cash movements execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions spread income on investments and borrowings are recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the transaction investments are classified as available for sale securities and are marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the equity section the most significant component of aigfps and aigtgs operating expenses is compensation which approximated 33 percent and 34 percent of revenues in the first nine months of 2003 and 2002 respectively domestically aigs consumer finance operations derive a substantial portion of their revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding mortgages and finance receivables from the sub prime market while overseas operations are engaged in developing a multi product consumer finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets revenues increased 6 5 percent in the first nine months of 2003 from the same period in 2002 operating income increased 19 4 percent compared to the 2002 period the increase in revenues was the result of growth in average finance receivables and credit quality continues to be strong further reductions of the cost to borrow led to an improvement in the operating income over the previous period consumer finance operations are exposed to loss when contractual

2003 investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses with respect to general insurance operations if paid losses accelerated beyond aigs ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows aig would need to liquidate a portion of its general insurance investment portfolio and or arrange for financing potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable decreased significantly in value see also the discussions under operational review general insurance operations herein with respect to life insurance operations if a substantial portion of the life insurance operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and or defaulted aig would need to liquidate other portions of its life insurance investment

invest fixed maturity investments with respect to fixed maturities aigs general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer industry and or country concentrations with respect to general insurance aigs strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase with respect to life insurance aigs strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities see also the discussion under operational review life insurance operations herein the fair value of the fixed maturity available for sale portfolio is subject to decline as interest rates rise and is subject to increase as interest rates decline such changes in fair value are presented as a component of comprehensive income in unrealized appreciation of investments net of taxes credit quality at september 30 2003 approximately 66 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities approximately 32 percent of such domestic securities were rated aaa by one or more of the principal rating agencies approximately 10 percent were below investment grade or not rated a significant portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio is rated by moodys standard and poors s and p or similar foreign services similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations aig annually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments including mortgages at september 30 2003 approximately 15 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated aaa or on the basis of aigs internal analysis were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated approximately 17 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date a large portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date equity investments aig invests in equities for various reasons including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk equity securities are subject to declines in fair value such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments net of taxes as a component of comprehensive income valuation of invested assets the valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market value for each security the source for the market value is generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of non traded securities another aspect of valuation is an assessment of impairment as a matter of policy the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of aigs management and a continual review of its investments in general a security is considered a candidate for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant discount to par amortized cost if lower or cost for an extended period of time the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation or ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or in the opinion of aigs management it is possible that aig may not realize a full recovery on its investment irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events 54 once a security has been identified as impaired the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price aig has the ability to hold any security to its stated maturity therefore the decision to sell reflects the judgment of aigs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale as a result of these policies aig recorded in the first nine months of 2003 impairment losses net of taxes of approximately 798 million no impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to aigs consolidated financial condition or results of operations and no individual impairment loss exceeded 1 8 percent of consolidated net income for the first nine months of 2003 excluding the impairments noted above the changes in market value for aigs available for sale portfolio which constitutes the vast majority of aigs investments were recorded in equity as unrealized gains or losses at september 30 2003 the unrealized losses after taxes of the fixed maturity securities were approximately 1 6 billion at september 30 2003 the unrealized losses after taxes of the equity securities portfolio were approximately 205 million at september 30 2003 aggregate unrealized gains after taxes were 11 1 billion and aggregate unrealized losses after taxes were 1 8 billion no single issuer accounted for more than two percent of the unrealized losses at september 30 2003 the fair value of aigs fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated to 300 8 billion of this aggregate fair value 0 57 percent represented securities trading at or below 75 percent of amortized cost or cost the impact on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be further mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholders accounts or realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs at september 30 2003 the unrealized losses

described above upon realization certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts or realization will result in a current decrease in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs as stated previously the valuation for aigs investment portfolio comes from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of non traded securities aig considers non traded securities to mean certain fixed income investments certain structured securities direct private equities limited partnerships and hedge funds the aggregate carrying value of these securities at september 30 2003 was approximately 58 7 billion the methodology used to estimate fair value of non traded fixed income investments is by reference to traded securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology this technique takes into account such factors as the industry the securitys rating and tenor its coupon rate its position in the capital structure of the issuer and other relevant factors the change in fair value is recognized as a component of unrealized appreciation for certain structured securities the carrying value is based on an estimate of the securitys future cash flows pursuant to the requirements of emerging issues task force issue no 99 20 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets the change in carrying value is recognized in income direct private equities hedge funds and limited partnerships in which aig holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair value the change in fair value is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income with respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which aig holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest aigs carrying value is the net asset value the changes in such net asset values are recorded in income 56 aig obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the sponsors of each of these investments the accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis each of these investment categories is regularly tested to determine if impairment in value exists various valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in this determination mortgage investments mortgage loans on real estate policy and collateral loans comprised 5 3 percent of aigs insurance invested assets at september 30 2003 aigs insurance operations holdings of real estate mortgages amounted to 12 05 billion of which 88 6 percent was domestic at september 30 2003 only a nominal amount was in default it is aigs practice to maintain a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 percent at loan origination at september 30 2003 aigs insurance holdings of collateral loans amounted to 1 66 billion all of which were foreign it is aigs strategy to enter into mortgage and collateral loans as an adjunct primarily to life

operations the current market value of these properties considerably exceeds their carrying value other investments other invested assets were primarily comprised of limited partnerships and hedge funds when permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets including invested assets from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aig and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users see also the discussion under derivatives herein in certain jurisdictions significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to aig parent these barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds managing market risk aigs insurance operations are exposed to market risk market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques one such technique is value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability aig believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management aig has performed a var analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of aigs insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment in this analysis financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses reserve for unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders funds due to the nature of each insurance segment aig manages the general and life insurance operations separately as a result aig manages separately the invested assets of each accordingly the 57 var analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aigs insurance segments as of september 30 2003 and december 31 2002 aig uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period in this case the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios for each scenario each transaction was re priced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the final var number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence i e only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure a one month holding period was assumed in computing the var figure the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of september 30 2003 and december 31 2002 var with respect to combined operations cannot be derived by aggregating the individual risk or segment amounts presented herein in millions data

liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates as of september 30 2003 and december 31 2002 aig statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a var model in this analysis the net fair value of ilfc was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt the estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of ilfc using the historical simulation methodology as previously described as of september 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the average var with respect to the aforementioned net fair value of ilfc was approximately 28 million and 20 million respectively aigs consumer finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and overseas such

september 30 2003 were as follows data table removed a these amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts aigfps interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale at market are managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation at september 30 2003 the unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were 37 million and 67 million respectively trading securities at market value and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased at market value are marked to market daily 60 with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time these securities are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of aigfp and aigtg the senior management of aig defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for aigfp and aigtg aigs senior management has established various

to and review future strategies with aigs senior management aig actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities in doing so aig must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit market liquidity operational and legal risks managing market risk market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions aigs philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried credit risk exposure is separately managed see the discussion on the management of credit risk below aigs market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aigs market exposures particularly those market exposures of aigfp and aigtg this department determines whether aigs market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aigs senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary aigfp and aigtg are exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices aigfp and aigtg hedge their exposure to these risks primarily through swaps options forwards and futures to hedge interest rate risks aigfp and aigtg may also purchase us and foreign government obligations aigfp and aigtg do not seek to manage the market risk of each transaction through an individual offsetting transaction rather aigfp and aigtg take a portfolio approach to the management of their market risk exposures aigfp and aigtg value their entire portfolios of market sensitive transactions at market value or at estimated fair value when market values are not readily available unrealized gains and losses with respect to these portfolios are reflected in income currently these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of aigfps and aigtgs transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfp aigtg and aigs management estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models these models utilize among other things market liquidity and current interest foreign exchange equity commodity and volatility rates these valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio as described above in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio based upon this evaluation aigfp determines what if any offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio aigfp and aigtg manage market risk with a variety of transactions including swaps trading securities futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate the recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if aigfp and aigtg were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations financial condition or liquidity such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity aigfp and aigtg attempt to secure reliable and independent current market prices such as published exchange prices external subscription services such as from bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available aigfp and aigtg use an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions historically actual 61 results have not materially deviated from these models aigfps and aigtgs systems can monitor each units respective market positions on an intraday basis aigfp and aigtg operate in major business centers overseas and are essentially open for business 24 hours a day thus the market

rates foreign exchange rates commodity and equity prices volatility levels and the effect of time these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio the results from these analyses feed into regular senior management reviews of the derivatives portfolio and hedges as described above aigfp and aigtg are exposed to the risk of

sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings in addition to credit ratings this committee takes into account other factors including the industry and country of the counterparty transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the aig credit risk committee it is also aigs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary aigfp and aigtg determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations if it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement then one or more enhancement techniques will be used examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit guarantees collateral credit triggers credit derivatives and margin agreements a significant majority of aigfps transactions are contracted and documented under isda master agreements management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set off in the event of default also under such agreements in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity aigfp may be permitted to set off its receivables from that counterparty against aigfps payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions excluding regulated exchange transactions aigtg whenever possible enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above discussions with respect to aigfps and aigtgs counterparty credit quality fair value source and notional amounts follow counterparty credit quality the following tables provide the counterparty credit quality amounts of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives transactions at september 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to aigfp and aigtg or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies netting under isda master agreements and excluding collateral held subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate currency commodity and equity swaps swaptions forward commitments futures and forward contracts approximated 19 52 billion at september 30 2003 including 1 8 billion of collateral held and 17 38 billion at december 31 2002 including 2 2 billion of collateral held the net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to aigfp and aigtg or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss aigfp and aigtg determine counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or where such ratings are not 63 available by internal analysis at september 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the concentration of credit exposure with respect to counterparties judged a or higher by aigfp and aigtg was 94 percent and 90 percent respectively the counterparty credit quality determined by aigfp and aigtg with respect to the net replacement value of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolio was as follows data table removed a exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis b the net replacement values with respect to exchange traded futures and options forward contracts and purchased over the counter options are presented as a component of trading assets in the accompanying balance sheet the net replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps are presented as a component of unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions in the accompanying balance sheet at september 30 2003 and december 31 2002 the counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolio was as follows data table removed exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis fair value source the fair value sources of the net replacement values of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolio were primarily based on valuation models although these models are proprietary the inputs were obtained from independently published exchange prices external subscription services prices such as bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in these models in the minimal instances when such prices are not available aigfp and aigtg use an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions notional amounts the notional amounts used to express the extent of aigfps and aigtgs involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of aigfps and aigtgs swaps business notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contrac 64 tual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received except for certain contracts such as currency swaps the timing and the amount of cash flows relating to aigfps and aigtgs foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements the following table presents the contractual and notional amounts by maturity and type of derivative of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives portfolio at september 30 2003 and december 31 2002 in millions data table removed notional amount is not representative of either market risk or credit risk aigfp enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary course of its business the overwhelming majority of aigfps credit derivatives require aigfp to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities aigfp provides such credit protection only on a second loss basis under which aigfps payment obligations arise only after credit losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold amount or level of first losses the threshold amount of credit losses that must be realized before aigfp has any payment obligation is negotiated by aigfp for each transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment obligation by aigfp under each transaction is remote even in severe recessionary market scenarios in many cases the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies typically there will be an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio and then successive layers that are rated generally a bbb rated layer an a rated layer an aa rated layer and an aaa rated layer in transactions that are rated the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior to the threshold level above which aigfps payment obligation would arise is rated aaa by the rating agencies for that reason the risk layer assumed by aigfp with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions is often called the super senior risk layer defined as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been rated aaa by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated equivalent thereto for example in a transaction with an equity layer covering credit losses from 0 to 2 percent of the total portfolio a bbb rated layer covering credit losses from 2 to 4 percent an a rated layer from 4 to 6 percent an aa rated layer from 6 to 8 percent and an aaa rated layer from 8 to 11 percent aigfp would cover credit losses arising in respect of the portfolio that exceed an 11 percent first loss threshold amount and thereby bear risk that is senior to the 8 to 11 percent aaa rated risk layer aigfp continually monitors the underlying portfolios to determine whether the credit loss experience for any particular portfolio has caused the likelihood of aigfp having a payment obligation under the transaction to be super senior risk aigfp maintains the ability opportunistically to hedge specific securities in a portfolio thereby further limiting its exposure to loss and has hedged outstanding transactions in this manner on occasion aigfp has never had a payment obligation 65 under these credit derivatives transactions furthermore based on portfolio credit losses experienced to date under all outstanding transactions no transaction has experienced credit losses in an amount that has made the likelihood of aigfp having to make a payment in aigfps view to be greater than remote even in severe recessionary market scenarios at september 30 2003 the notional amount with respect to aigfps credit derivative portfolio was 160 29 billion in addition to its role as derivatives dealer through aigfp and aigtg aig and its subsidiaries including its insurance subsidiaries use derivatives primarily to minimize aigs asset liability exposure and foreign currency and interest rate exposures these transactions are generally executed with aigfp and aigtg as counterparties who in turn hedge these transactions in the market place thus aigfp and aigtg assume the credit risk exposure aig also uses derivatives to help match assets and liabilities in several of its businesses including its insurance operations for example aig can use currency and interest rate swaps to convert foreign currency investment contract liabilities into u s dollar based exposures thus these liabilities are more properly matched with u s dollar assets in life insurance aig uses swaps to reduce the mismatch between long dated life insurance liabilities and shorter dated local currency assets swaps also enable aig to balance its asset and liability durations in consumer finance operations aigs derivatives review committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction the committee examines among other things the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction its potential credit exposure if any and the estimated benefits this committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by aigfp and aigtg for their own accounts generally aig conducts its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment thus exchange gains or losses occur when aigs foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the u s dollar from one reporting period to the next legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability through legal or judicial processes of the obligations of aigs clients and counterparties including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations see also the discussion on master netting agreements above accounting standards in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 142 as of january 1 2002 aig adopted fas 142 fas 142 requires aig to discontinue the amortization of goodwill in its consolidated income statement fas 142 requires goodwill to be subject to an assessment of impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred the assessment of impairment involves a two step process prescribed in fas 142 whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed followed by a measurement of the amount of impairment if any fas 142 also requires the completion of a transitional impairment test in the year of adoption with any identified impairments recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles during the second quarter aig completed its transitional impairment test for 2002 resulting in no impairment changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are primarily caused as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments in november 2002 fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin45 fin45 requires that for guarantees within its scope that are issued or amended after december 31 2002 a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee be established and recognized through earnings to date the impact on earnings for aig has not been and is not expected to be material aig guarantees the indebtedness of third parties principally in connection with aig sunamericas investments in affordable housing properties the guarantees are issued primarily to facilitate financing for the construction of the underlying properties and range in duration of up to ten years since the inception of this investment program over ten years ago payments under these guarantees have been insignificant this is due to the fact that 66 the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner and secondly are secured by the underlying properties the maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable security under these guarantees as of september 30 2003 is approximately 2 9 billion in addition aigs real estate investment operations will occasionally extend similar guarantees to real estate partnerships in which they are an investor the guarantees facilitate financing for the construction and or purchase of land there have been no payments to date under these guarantees this is due to the fact that the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner and secondly are secured by the underlying properties the maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable security under these guarantees as of september 30 2003 is approximately 175 million through its ilfc subsidiary aig has also provided other types of guarantees from time to time ilfc participates with airlines banks and other financial institutions to assist in financing aircraft by providing asset guarantees put options or loan guarantees historically losses arising from these guarantees have been immaterial as ilfc has recourse to the value of the underlying aircraft which offsets ilfcs exposure should ilfc be called upon to fulfill its obligations under these guarantees the maximum exposure before consideration of the applicable security of these guarantees as of september 30 2003 is approximately 964 million in january 2003 fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities fin46 fin46 changes the method of determining whether certain entities should be consolidated in aigs consolidated financial statements an entity is subject to fin46 and is called a variable interest entity vie if it has i equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entitys operations or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary which is the party that has a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of the vie or both all other entities not considered vies are evaluated for consolidation under existing guidance the provisions of fin46 are to be applied immediately to vies created after january 31 2003 and to vies in which aig obtains an interest after that date for vies in which aig holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 fin46 was to be applied at the beginning of the fiscal quarter ended september 30 2003 however the fasb at its meeting on october 8 2003 issued staff position 46 6 effective date of fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation of vies fsp46 6 fsp46 6 delayed the implementation provisions for entities created before february 1 2003 to the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2003 therefore aig delayed implementation of the provisions of fin46 related to entities created before february 1 2003 from july 1 2003 to december 31 2003 for any vies that must be consolidated under fin46 that were created before february 1 2003 the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vies will be initially measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change fasb continues to re evaluate and potentially modify many of the provisions of fin46 in its present form aig estimates that it will consolidate approximately 6 billion of assets and liabilities and will record a one time cumulative accounting charge upon adoption of fin46 which will not have a material effect on aigs results of operations of that total approximately 3 5 billion relates to third party investments in collateralized bond and loan obligation trusts collectively collateralized debt obligation trusts or cdo trusts that are managed by aig subsidiaries the aig subsidiaries receive fees for management of the assets held in the cdo trust which support the issuance of securities sold by the cdo trust aig subsidiaries may take minority equity and or fixed income security interest in the cdo trust aig subsidiaries have entered into such arrangements to expand their asset management activities in these structures the third party investors have recourse only to the cdo trust and have no recourse to aig subsidiaries in addition approximately 2 billion relates to other liabilities arising from aigs real estate partnerships principally connected to affordable hous 67 ing transactions involving aig sunamerica subsidiaries of the 2 billion only approximately 200 million relates to third party debt obligations and approximately 100 million relates to third party equity of the remainder approximately 500 million involves ilfc and arises principally from a sale leaseback transaction in addition to the vie activities noted above aig uses vies primarily in connection with certain guaranteed investment contract programs gic programs written by its life insurance subsidiaries certain products provided by aigfp and certain invested asset activities in the gic programs aigs life insurance subsidiaries principally sunamerica life insurance company provide guaranteed investment contracts gics to vies which are not controlled by that subsidiary or any other aig entity and for which no aig entity has a direct variable interest as defined under fin 46 in the entity the vie issues notes or bonds which are sold to third party institutional investors neither the insurance company issuing the gics nor any other aig entity has any obligations to the investors in the notes or bonds the proceeds from the securities issued by the vie are invested by the vie in the gics the insurance company subsidiaries use their proceeds to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities primarily investment grade bonds see also the discussion under liquidity and insurance invested assets herein both the assets and the liabilities of the insurance companies arising from these gic programs are presented in aigs consolidated balance sheet thus at september 30 2003 approximately 34 billion of policyholders contract deposits represented liabilities from issuances of gics included in these gic programs offset by the proceeds from the issuances which are included as insurance invested assets aigfp uses vies as an integral part of its ongoing operations with respect to specific structured transactions with independent third parties in most instances aigfp controls and manages the assets and liabilities with respect to these vies subject to certain transaction specific limitations these vies are fully consolidated by aig aigfp also sponsors a vie that issues commercial paper and secured liquidity notes to third party institutional investors this vie uses the proceeds of these offerings to obtain beneficial interests in certain financial assets total assets of approximately 865 million which serve as collateral for the securities issued by the vie aigfp provides credit and liquidity support to this vie which is not required to be consolidated by aig pursuant to fin 46 aigs insurance operations also invest in assets of vies these vies are established by unrelated third parties investments include collateralized mortgage backed securities and similar securities backed by pools of mortgages consumer receivables or other assets the investment in a vie allows aigs insurance entities increased flexibility to purchase assets permitted by insurance regulations these vies are not required to be consolidated by aig pursuant to fin 46 effective january 1 2003 aig adopted the recognition provision of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stock based compensation fas 123 this statement establishes the financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans such as aigs stock purchase plan stock option plan and stock incentive plan under the recognition provisions of fas 123 costs with respect to stock compensation are measured using the fair value of the shares subscribed or granted as at the date of grant recognized ratably over the vesting period such fair value is derived through an option pricing model statement of financial accounting standards no 148 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to fasb statement no 123 fas 148 was issued in 2002 this statement amended fas 123 and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the recognition provisions of fas 123 also fas 148 amended certain of the disclosure requirements of fas 123 aig has elected the prospective method in the application of the recognition provisions as prescribed by fas 123 such method provides for the recognition of the fair value with respect to stock based compensation for shares subscribed for or granted on or after january 1 2003 prior to adoption of the recognition provisions of fas 123 as amended aig recognized stock compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees with respect to net income for the nine months and quarter ended september 30 2003 and 2002 68 the following table provides a pro forma reconciliation as if aig had adopted the recognition provisions of fas 123 at its inception data table removed in may 2003 fasb issued financial accounting standard no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas 150 fas 150 requires certain financial instruments previously classified as either entirely equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the balance sheet be classified as liabilities fas 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities the following three types of freestanding financial instruments mandatory redeemable financial instruments obligations to repurchase the issuers equity shares by transferring assets and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares fas 150 is effective for the quarter ending september 30 2003 as of september 30 2003 1 68 billion of preferred instruments previously classified on aigs consolidated balance sheet as preferred shareholders equity in subsidiary companies shall now be classified in a new liability caption entitled preferred shareholders equity in subsidiary companies subject to mandatory redemption restatement of financial statements for prior periods is not permitted in july 2003 the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position 03 1 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop 03 1 fasb did not object to the issuance of sop 03 1 this statement is effective as of january 1 2004 and will require aig to recognize a liability for guaranteed minimum death benefits and other living benefits related to its variable annuity and variable life contracts and modify certain disclosures and financial statement presentations for these products aig continues to evaluate the provisions of sop 03 1 management currently expects the one time cumulative accounting charge upon adoption to approximate 200 million after income taxes to be recorded in the first quarter of 2004 which is not material to aigs financial condition or liquidity recent developments on august 29 2003 aig announced that the acquisition of the ge edison life insurance company in japan and ges u s based auto and home insurance business was completed the japanese life insurance company will be renamed aig edison life insurance company effective january 1 2004 subject to regulatory approval the ge property casualty insurance companies acquired by aig will operate together with aigs domestic personal lines subsidiaries in addition to the purchase of ges japan life and u s personal auto insurance business aig has entered into cooperative agreements in russia to identify investment opportunities improve homeowners insurance and provide financing alternatives for russian home buyers aig also recently entered into a cooperative agreement with the peoples insurance company of china picc that will enable aig to market its accident and health products through the piccs 4 300 branch offices aig will provide training to piccs agents and expects to sell an extended portfolio of products that aig does not currently distribute through its life branches or property casualty operations in china aig also purchased a 9 9 percent interest in piccs initial public offering 69 controls and procedures
