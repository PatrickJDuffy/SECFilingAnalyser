financial information and statements concerning future economic performance and events plans and objectives relating to management operations products and services and assumptions underlying these projections and statements these projections and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only aigs belief regarding future events many of which by their nature are inherently uncertain and outside aigs control these projections and statements may address among other things the status and potential future outcome of the current regulatory and civil proceedings against aig

aigs actual results to differ possible materially from those in the specific projections and statements are discussed throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in risk factors in item 1a part i of aigs 2005 annual report on form 10 k aig is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligations to update or alter any projection or other statement whether written or oral that may be made from time to time whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 33 american international group inc and subsidiaries throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aig presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful statutory loss ratios and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance filed with insurance regulatory authorities and used for analysis in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with aigs insurance competitors aig has also incorporated into this discussion a number of cross references to additional information included throughout this form 10 q a to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject restatement of previously issued financial statements in connection with preparation of aigs consolidated financial statements included in aigs 2004 annual report on form 10 k aigs current management initiated an internal review of aigs books and records which was substantially expanded in mid march 2005 as a result of the internal review aig concluded that the accounting for certain transactions and certain relationships needed to be restated or adjusted aig restated the accounting for certain transactions and certain relationships for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 2001 and 2000 the quarters ended march 31 june 30 and september 30 2004 and 2003 and the quarter ended december 31 2003 the first restatement as announced on november 9 2005 aig identified certain errors the preponderance of which were identified during the remediation of material weaknesses in internal controls referred to in the explanatory note principally relating to internal controls surrounding accounting for derivatives and related assets and liabilities under fas 133 reconciliation of certain balance sheet accounts and income tax accounting aig also announced it was correcting errors that were identified since the first restatement including those related to the accounting for certain payments received from aircraft and engine manufacturers by ilfc which were originally corrected in aigs second quarter form 10 q the adjustments to correct the foregoing errors are referred to in this first quarter form 10 q a as the initial adjustments in connection with the remediation of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting referred to in the explanatory note aig identified certain additional errors principally relating to internal controls over reconciliation of certain balance sheet accounts in dbg as a result aig is including further adjustments the additional adjustments in its restatement of the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 along with 2001 and 2000 for purposes of the preparation of the selected consolidated financial data for 2001 and 2000 and quarterly financial information for 2004 and 2003 and is restating the first three quarters of 2005 the initial adjustments and the additional adjustments are referred to herein as the second restatement aigs quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended september 30 2005 september 2005 form 10 q will not be amended because the additional adjustments to the financial statements included therein are not material to those financial statements the financial information that is included in this first quarter form 10 q a has been restated as part of the first restatement and the second restatement the restatements overview of operations and business results aig identifies its reportable segments by product line consistent with its management structure aigs major product and service groupings are general insurance life insurance and retirement services financial services and asset management aigs operations in 2005 are conducted by its subsidiaries principally through these segments through these segments aig provides insurance and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions this geographic product and service diversification is one of aigs major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors the importance of this diversification was especially evident in 2004 when record catastrophe losses in certain insurance operations were more than offset by profitability in those operations as well as in other segments and product lines although regional economic downturns or political upheaval could negatively affect parts of aigs operations aig believes that its diversification makes it unlikely that regional difficulties would have a material effect on its operating results financial condition or liquidity aigs subsidiaries serve commercial institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network in the united states aig companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and one of the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well aigs financial services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing capital markets operations and consumer finance both in the united states and abroad aig also provides asset management services and offers guaranteed investment contracts also known as funding agreements gics to institutions and individuals aigs operating performance reflects implementation of various long term strategies and defined goals in its various operating segments a primary goal of aig in managing its general insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting profit to achieve this goal aig must be disciplined in its risk selection and premiums must be adequate and terms and conditions 34 american international group inc and subsidiaries appropriate to cover the risk accepted aig believes in strict control of expenses another central focus of aig operations in current years is the development and expansion of new distribution channels in 2004 aig expanded its distribution channels in many asian countries which now include banks credit card companies and television media home shopping in late 2003 aig entered into an agreement with picc property and casualty company limited picc which will enable the marketing of accident and health products throughout china through piccs branch networks and agency system aig participates in the underwriting results through a reinsurance agreement and also holds a 9 9 percent ownership interest in picc other examples of new distribution channels used both domestically and overseas include banks affinity groups direct response and e commerce aig patiently builds relationships in markets around the world where it sees long term growth opportunities for example the fact that aig has the only wholly owned foreign life insurance operations in eight cities in china is the result of relationships developed over nearly 30 years aigs more recent extensions of operations into india vietnam russia and other emerging markets reflect the same growth strategy moreover aig believes in investing in the economies and infrastructures of these countries and growing with them when aig companies enter a new jurisdiction they typically offer both basic protection and savings products as the economies evolve aigs products evolve with them to more sophisticated and investment oriented models growth for aig may be generated both internally and through acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and offer adequate return on capital in recent years the acquisitions of aig star life and aig edison life have broadened aigs penetration of the japanese market through new distribution channels and will result in operating efficiencies as they are integrated into aigs previously existing companies operating in japan aig provides leadership on issues of concern to the global and local economies as well as the insurance and financial services industries in recent years efforts to reform the tort system and class action litigation procedures legislation to deal with the asbestos problem and the renewal of the terrorism risk insurance act have been key issues while in prior years trade legislation and superfund had been issues of concern the following table summarizes aigs revenues income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change and net income for the three months ended march 31 2005 and 2004 data table removed consolidated results the 17 1 percent growth in revenues in the first three months of 2005 was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from global general insurance operations as well as growth in both general insurance and life insurance and retirement services net investment income and life insurance and retirement services gaap premiums aigs income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change increased 47 0 percent in the first three months of 2005 when compared to the same period of 2004 general insurance

first three months of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004 was primarily attributable to strong growth in operating income with respect to domestic brokerage groups and foreign generals operations offset by a decrease in realized capital gains for the segment in the first three months of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004 dbgs operating income included additional losses in the first three months of 2005 resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 florida hurricanes life insurance and retirement services aigs life insurance and retirement services operations provide insurance financial and investment products throughout the world foreign operations provided approximately 55 percent of aigs life insurance and retirement services operating income for the first quarter of 2005 life insurance and retirement services operating income increased by 24 7 percent in the first three months of 2005 when compared to the same period of 2004 this increase resulted from growth in aigs principal life insurance and retirement services businesses and the decline in realized capital losses in 2005 compared to 2004 financial services aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing capital market transactions consumer finance and insurance premium financing financial services operating income increased by 78 9 percent in the first three months of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004 primarily due to the fluctuation in earnings resulting from the accounting effect of fas 133 fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of capital markets operations and the effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 for hedges on securities available for sale and borrowings consumer finance operations increased revenues and operating income both domestically and internationally asset management aigs asset management operations include institutional and retail asset management and broker dealer services and spread based investment business from the sale of gics these products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas asset management operating income increased 35 3 percent in the first three months of 2005 when compared to the same period of 2004 as a result of the upturn in worldwide financial markets and a strong global product portfolio capital resources at march 31 2005 aig had total consolidated shareholders equity of 81 61 billion and total consolidated borrowings of 106 02 billion at that date 96 51 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by aig or were aigfps matched

march 31 2005 aig purchased in the open market 2 477 100 shares of its common stock liquidity at march 31 2005 aigs consolidated invested assets included 24 38 billion in cash and short term investments consolidated net cash used in operating activities in the first three months of 2005 amounted to 434 million the 434 million in consolidated net cash used in operating activities is net of approximately 8 billion used by aigfp to purchase securities purchased under agreements to resell and to repurchase securities sold under agreements to repurchase in the ordinary course of aigfps business this operating 36 american international group inc and subsidiaries activity was funded in part by proceeds from security sales under similar repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements but primarily by aigfps financing activities specifically proceeds from guaranteed investment agreements and notes bonds loans and mortgages payable approximately half of the 8 billion was subsequently invested in securities available for sale aig believes that its liquid assets and access to short term funding through commercial paper and bank credit facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated cash requirements outlook from march through june of 2005 the major rating agencies downgraded aigs ratings in a series of actions standard and poors a division of the mcgraw hill companies inc s and p lowered the long term senior debt and counterparty ratings of aig from aaa to aa second highest of eight rating categories and changed the rating outlook to negative s and ps outlook indicates the potential direction of a rating over the intermediate term typically six months to two years a negative outlook means that a rating may be lowered however an outlook is not necessarily a precursor to a rating change moodys investors service moodys lowered aigs long term senior debt rating from aaa to aa2 second highest of nine rating categories with a stable outlook moodys appends numerical modifiers 1 2 and 3 to the generic rating categories to show relative position within rating categories fitch ratings fitch downgraded the long term senior debt ratings of aig from aaa to aa second highest of nine rating categories and placed the ratings on rating watch negative a fitch rating watch notifies investors that there is a reasonable probability of a rating change and the likely direction of such change a rating watch negative indicates a potential downgrade rating watch is typically resolved over a relatively short period in april 2006 fitch removed aig from rating watch negative and affirmed its rating with a stable outlook the agencies also took rating actions on aigs insurance subsidiaries s and p lowered the financial strength ratings of aigs insurance subsidiaries to aa second highest rating of eight rating categories and assigned a negative rating outlook fitch also lowered the financial strength ratings of aigs insurance companies to aa second highest of nine rating categories and placed them on rating watch negative in april 2006 fitch removed the financial strength ratings from rating watch negative and affirmed them with a stable

subsidiaries from a to a second highest of fourteen rating levels and the issuer credit ratings from aa to aa remaining within the second highest of nine rating levels and placed the ratings under review with negative implications an under review modifier by a m best is assigned to a company whose rating opinion is under review and may be subject to change in the near term generally defined as

and short term senior debt ratings of american general finance corporation of a a 1 third highest of eight rating categories highest of eight rating categories and a1 p 1 third highest of nine rating categories highest of three rating categories respectively these debt and financial strength ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies as such they may be changed suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in or unavailability of information or based on other circumstances ratings may also be withdrawn at aig managements request this discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of aig and its subsidiaries these ratings actions have affected and will continue to affect aigs business and results of operations in a number of ways downgrades in aigs debt ratings will adversely affect aigs results of operations aig relies on external sources of financing to fund several of its operations the cost and availability of unsecured financing are generally dependent on the issuers long term and short term debt ratings these downgrades and any future downgrades in aigs debt ratings will increase aigs borrowing costs and therefore adversely affect aigs results of operations the downgrade in aigs long term senior debt ratings will adversely affect aigfps ability to compete for cer 37 american international group inc and subsidiaries tain businesses credit ratings are very important to the ability of financial institutions to compete in the derivative and structured transaction marketplaces historically aigs triple a ratings provided aigfp a competitive advantage the downgrades have reduced this advantage and for specialized financial transactions that generally are conducted only by triple a rated financial institutions counterparties may be unwilling to transact business with aigfp except on a secured basis this could require aigfp to post more collateral to counterparties in the future see below for a further discussion of the effect that posting collateral may have on aigs liquidity although the financial strength ratings of aigs insurance company subsidiaries remain high compared to many of their competitors the downgrades have reduced the previous ratings differential the competitive advantage of the ratings to aigs insurance company subsidiaries may be lessened accordingly the regulatory inquiries internal investigations and delay in the filing of the 2004 annual report on form 10 k as well as negative publicity had caused independent producers and distributors of aigs domestic life and retirement services products to be more cautious in placing business with aig subsidiaries aig is unable to predict the effect of these issues on aigs business including any increase in associated surrender or replacement activity as a result of the downgrades of aigs long term senior debt ratings aig was required to post approximately 1 16 billion of collateral with counterparties to municipal guaranteed investment agreements and financial derivatives transactions in the event of a further downgrade aig will be required to post additional collateral it is estimated that as of the close of business on february 28 2006 based on aigs outstanding municipal guaranteed investment agreements and financial derivatives transactions as of such date a further downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings to aa3 by moodys or aa by s and p would permit counterparties to call for approximately 962 million of additional collateral further additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral which could have a material effect on how aig manages its liquidity the actual amount of additional collateral that aig would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions the market value of the outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade any additional obligations to post collateral will increase the demand on aigs liquidity despite industry price erosion in some classes of general insurance aig expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new general insurance businesses as a result of aigs broad product line and extensive distribution networks aig expects total general insurance premiums to increase for 2005 and expects cash flow for investments to remain strong thus general insurance net investment income is expected to rise in future quarters even in a continued low interest rate environment in china aig has wholly owned life insurance operations in eight cities these operations should benefit from chinas rapid rate of economic growth and growing middle class a segment that is a prime market for life insurance aig believes that it may also have opportunities in the future to grow by entering the group insurance business however in march 2005 it withdrew its application to serve the group insurance market until certain regulatory issues are resolved among the regulatory issues to be addressed is the response to aigs acknowledgment that certain of its hong kong based agents sold life insurance to customers on the chinese mainland in contravention of applicable regulations aig edison life acquired in august 2003 adds to the current agency force in japan and provides alternative distribution channels including banks financial advisers and corporate and government employee relationships aig edison lifes integration into aigs existing japanese operations will provide future operating efficiencies in january 2005 aig star life entered into an agreement with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi one of japans largest banks to market a multi currency fixed annuity through alico aig star life and aig edison aig has developed a leadership position in the distribution of annuities through banks aig is also a leader in the direct marketing of insurance products through sponsors and in the broad market aig also expects continued growth in india korea and vietnam domestically aig anticipates continued operating growth in 2005 as distribution channels are expanded and new products are introduced the home service operation has not met business objectives although its cash flow has been strong and domestic group life health was also weak aig american generals current ratings remain equal to or higher than many of its principal competitors nevertheless recent events have caused independent producers and distributors of aig american generals products to be more cautious in placing business with aig therefore aig is unable to predict the effect of these issues on aigs business including any increase in associated surrender or replacement activity in the airline industry changes in market conditions are not immediately apparent in operating results lease rates have firmed considerably as a result of strong demand spurred by the recovering global commercial aviation market especially in asia sales have begun to increase and aig expects an increasing level of interest from a variety of purchasers therefore aig believes that the improvements in that market which commenced in 2003 will be gradually reflected in ilfcs results in 2005 in the capital markets operations the integration of aig trading group inc and its 38 american international group inc and subsidiaries subsidiaries into the operations of aigfp created operating efficiencies that will continue to be realized and product synergies that should enhance 2005 results although quarter to quarter variations are to be expected in this transaction oriented business aig also expects increased contributions to financial services revenues and income from its consumer finance operations both domestically and overseas however the downgrades of aigs credit ratings may adversely affect funding costs for aig and its subsidiaries and aigfps ability to engage in derivative transactions and certain structured products see risk factors aigs credit ratings in item 1a of part i of aigs 2005 annual report on form 10 k gics which are sold domestically and abroad to both institutions and individuals are written on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are favorable aig expects to launch a matched investment program utilizing issuances of aig debt securities which will become aigs principal spread based investment activity however in light of recent developments the timing of the launch of this program is uncertain because aigs credit spreads in the capital markets have widened following the ratings declines there may be a reduction in the earnings on new business in aigs spread based funding businesses aig has many promising growth initiatives underway around the world in its insurance and other operations cooperative agreements such as those with picc and various banks in the u s japan and korea are expected to expand distribution networks for aigs products and provide models for future growth critical accounting estimates aig considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts deferred policy acquisition costs estimated gross profits for investment oriented products fair value determinations for certain capital markets assets and liabilities and other than temporary declines in the value of investments these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used aigs results of operations would be directly affected throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aigs critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail the major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below reserves for losses and loss expenses general insurance data table removed future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts life insurance and retirement services

from verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the transactions other than temporary declines in the value of investments securities are considered a candidate for impairment based upon the following criteria 39 american international group inc and subsidiaries trading at a significant 25 percent or more discount to par amortized cost if lower or cost for an

transatlantic personal lines including 21st century insurance group 21st century and united guaranty corporation ugc aigs primary domestic division is dbg dbgs business in the united states and canada is conducted through its general insurance subsidiaries including american home national union lexington and certain other general insurance company subsidiaries of aig dbg writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers this provides dbg the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control any licensed broker is able to submit business to dbg without the traditional agent company contractual relationship but such broker usually has no authority to commit dbg to accept a risk in addition to writing substantially all classes of business insurance including large commercial or industrial property insurance excess liability inland marine environmental workers compensation and excess and umbrella coverages dbg offers many specialized forms of insurance such as aviation accident and health equipment breakdown directors and officers liability d and o difference in conditions kidnap ransom export credit and political risk and various types of professional errors and omissions coverages the aig risk management operation provides insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers the aig risk finance operation is a leading provider of customized structured insurance products also included in dbg are the operations of aig environmental which focuses specifically on providing specialty products to clients with environmental exposures lexington writes surplus lines those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts certain of the products of the dbg companies include funding components or have been structured in a manner such that little or no insurance risk is actually transferred funds received in connection with these products are recorded as deposits included in other liabilities rather than premiums and incurred losses the aig worldsource division introduces and coordinates aigs products and services to u s based multinational clients and foreign corporations doing business in the u s transatlantic

multiple distribution channels to write both business and personal lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws customs and needs aiu operates in asia the pacific rim the united kingdom europe africa the middle east and latin america as previously noted aig believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its investors accordingly in its general insurance business aig uses certain non gaap measures where aig has determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful a critical discipline of a successful general insurance business is the objective to produce profit from underwriting activities exclusive of investment related income when un 40 american international group inc and subsidiaries derwriting is not profitable premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses and underwriting related expenses in these situations the addition of general insurance related investment income and realized capital gains may however enable a general insurance business to produce operating income for these reasons aig views underwriting results to be critical in the overall evaluation of performance statutory underwriting profit is derived by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting generally requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes expenses are recognized immediately not over the same period that the revenues are earned thus statutory expenses exclude changes in deferred acquisition costs dac gaap provides for the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the accounting principle of matching therefore acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period the related net premiums written are earned dac is reviewed for recoverability and such review requires management judgment see also critical accounting estimates herein aig along with most general insurance companies uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance the loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized in income as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity regulation product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios general insurance operating income is comprised of statutory underwriting results changes in dac net investment income and realized capital gains and losses operating income as well as net premiums written net premiums earned net investment income and realized capital gains losses and statutory ratios for the three months ended march 31 2005 and 2004 were as follows data table removed 41 american international group inc and subsidiaries data table removed a includes 118 million of additional losses incurred resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 florida hurricanes 1 53 points increase on the domestic general loss ratio and 1 16 points increase on the consolidated general loss ratio b includes the results of wholly owned aiu agencies general insurance results general insurance operating income in the first three months of 2005 showed excellent results the increase in general insurance operating income in the first three months of 2005 was primarily attributable to strong profitable growth in foreign generals underwriting results and dbgs and foreign generals net investment income partially offset by a decrease in realized capital gains relative to the same period of 2004 dbgs underwriting results included additional losses incurred resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 florida hurricanes like most aig units dbg benefited in the first three months of 2005 from a strong profit center focus and growing distribution channels overall dbgs net premiums written increased in the first three months of 2005 over 2004 as new business generally higher renewal retention rates and a modest change in the mix of business towards classes i e smaller accounts that purchase less reinsurance more than offset modest rate decreases in some classes i e property d and o healthcare aviation domestic property casualty premium rates are generally satisfactory at this time although aig has begun to see evidence in some classes of business including property d and o energy and healthcare where rates quoted by other carriers on selected accounts or segments do not meet aigs view of satisfactory the loss ratio decreased from same period of 2004 principally as a result of the impact of prior year rate increases on premiums earned in the quarter lower losses in the quarter in short tail classes of business such as property and accident and health offset by 118 million of additional losses incurred resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 florida hurricanes transatlantics net premiums written and net premiums earned for the first quarter of 2005 decreased compared with the same period in 2004 principally as a result of decreased domestic business partially offset by increased international business personal lines net premiums written in the first three months of 2005 increased when compared to the same period of 2004 due to good growth in its core business units through expanded marketing efforts increased agent broker appointments and enhanced product offerings these gains were partially offset by reductions in its involuntary auto business due to aggressive re underwriting of the previously acquired ge business underwriting income increased as a result of earned premium growth and favorable development of prior accident years mortgage guarantys net premiums written increased in the first three months of 2005 when compared to the same period of 2004 strong growth in junior liens student loans and international business were offset by continued low persistency in the residential first lien business caused by high refinance activity fueled by low mortgage interest rates foreign general insurance had strong results in the first three months of 2005 growth in net premiums written was achieved due to new business as well as new distribution channels partially offset by rate decreases in australia and the united kingdom

insurance net premiums written for the first three months of 2005 data table removed as previously noted dbgs results include 118 million of additional losses incurred in the first three months of 2005 resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 florida hurricanes other effects of catastrophes incurred in the first three months of 2005 and 2004 were insignificant the effect on losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult with respect to catastrophe losses aig believes that it has taken appropriate steps such as careful exposure selection and obtaining reinsurance coverage to reduce the effect of the magnitude of possible future losses the occurrence of one or more catastrophic

interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change was 29 1 percent in the first three months of 2005 compared to 37 5 percent in the same period of 2004 reinsurance aig is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations aig insures risks globally and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide aig the level of reinsurance protection that aig desires reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention at prudent levels set by management aig also purchases reinsurance to mitigate its catastrophic exposure aig is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs because one or more catastrophe losses could negatively affect aigs reinsurers and result in an inability of aig to collect reinsurance recoverables aigs reinsurance department evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of state of the art industry recognized program models among other techniques aig supplements these models through continually monitoring the risk exposure of aigs worldwide general insurance operations and adjusting such models accordingly while reinsurance arrangements do not relieve aig from its direct obligations to its insureds an efficient and effective reinsurance program substantially limits aigs exposure to potentially significant losses aigs consolidated general reinsurance assets amounted to 17 96 billion at march 31 2005 and resulted from aigs reinsurance arrangements thus a credit exposure existed at march 31 2005 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse aig under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements aig manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and when necessary aig holds substantial collateral in the form of funds securities and or irrevocable letters of credit this collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis at december 31 2004 approximately 43 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers in order to obtain statutory recognition the majority of these balances were collateralized the remaining 57 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers the terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories not creditworthiness approximately 90 percent of the balances with respect to authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated a excellent or better as rated by a m best or a strong or better as rated by standard and poors through march 31 2005 these distribution percentages have not changed significantly these ratings are measures of financial strength aig maintains a reserve for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance but it has been largely successful in its previous recovery efforts at december 31 2004 aig had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating 800 million at that date aig had no significant reinsurance recoverables due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled e g liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction aigs reinsurance security department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic such assessments include but are not limited to identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity and evaluating the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates this department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the requirements for credit risk mitigants for example in aigs treaty reinsurance contracts aig includes provisions that frequently require a reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced event occurs furthermore aig limits its unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers which include but are not limited to insurer financial strength rating downgrades policyholder surplus declines at or below a certain predetermined level or a certain predetermined level of a reinsurance recoverable being reached in addition aigs credit risk committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer aig enters into intercompany reinsurance transactions primarily through airco for its general insurance and life insurance operations aig enters into these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among aigs various legal entities these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation aig generally obtains letters of credit in order to obtain statutory recognition of these intercompany reinsurance transactions at march 31 2005 approximately 3 3 billion of letters of credit were outstanding to cover 43 american international group inc and subsidiaries intercompany reinsurance transactions with airco or other general insurance subsidiaries at march 31 2005 the consolidated general reinsurance assets of 17 96 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of 597 million 14 24 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses including ceded losses incurred but not reported ibnr ceded reserves and ceded reserve for unearned premiums of 3 12 billion the ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management any adjustments thereto are reflected in income currently it is aigs belief that the ceded reserves at march 31 2005 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable in the future as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves

statutory filings the dbg net loss reserve of 33 89 billion is comprised principally of the business of aig subsidiaries participating in the american home national union pool 11 companies and the surplus lines pool lexington starr excess liability insurance company and landmark insurance company beginning in 1998 dbg ceded a quota share percentage of its other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business to airco the quota share percentage ceded was 40 percent in 1998 65 percent in 1999 75 percent in 2000 and 2001 50 percent in 2002 and 2003 40 percent in 2004 and 35 percent in 2005 and covered all business written in these years for these lines by participants in the american home national union pool in 1998 the cession reflected only the other liability occurrence business but in 1999 and subsequent years included products liability occurrence aircos loss reserves relating to these quota share cessions from dbg are recorded on a discounted basis as of march 31 2005 airco carried a discount of approximately 610 million applicable to the 3 98 billion in undiscounted reserves it assumed from the american home national union pool via this quota share cession airco also carries approximately 375 million in net loss reserves relating to foreign general insurance business these reserves are carried on an undiscounted basis beginning in 1997 the personal lines division ceded a percentage of all business written by the companies participating in the personal lines pool to the american home national union pool as noted above the total reserves carried by participants in the american home national union pool relating to this cession amounted to 700 million as of march 31 2005 the companies participating in the american home national union pool have maintained a participation in the business written by aiu for decades as of march 31 2005 these aiu reserves carried by participants in the american home national union pool amounted to approximately 1 95 billion the remaining foreign general reserves are carried by aiuo airco and other smaller aig subsidiaries 44 american international group inc and subsidiaries domiciled outside the united states statutory filings in the u s by aig companies reflect all the business written by u s domiciled entities only and therefore exclude business written by aiuo airco and all other internationally domiciled subsidiaries the total reserves carried at march 31 2005 by aiuo and airco were approximately 3 41 billion and 3 74 billion respectively aircos 3 74 billion in total general insurance reserves consist of approximately 3 37 billion from business assumed from the american home national union pool and an additional 375 million relating to foreign general insurance business at march 31 2005 aigs overall general insurance net loss reserves reflects a loss reserve discount of 1 56 billion including tabular and non tabular calculations the tabular workers compensation discount is calculated using a 3 5 percent interest rate and the 1979 81 decennial mortality table the non tabular workers compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in new york and pennsylvania and follows the statutory regulations for each state for new york companies the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies own payout patterns for pennsylvania companies the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern for accident years 2002 and subsequent the discount is based on the yield of u s treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the companys own payout pattern with the future expected payment for each year using the interest rate associated with the corresponding treasury security yield for that time period the discount is comprised of the following 401 million tabular discount for workers compensation in dbg 544 million non tabular discount for workers compensation in dbg and 610 million non tabular discount for other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence in airco the total undiscounted workers compensation loss reserve carried by dbg is approximately 6 9 billion as of march 31 2005 the other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business in airco that is assumed from dbg is discounted using a 5 5 percent interest rate and the dbg payout pattern for this business the undiscounted reserves assumed by airco from dbg totaled approximately 3 98 billion at march 31 2005 the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently it is managements belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as of march 31 2005 while aig annually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of march 31 2005 in the opinion of management such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated financial position although it could have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the table below presents the reconciliation of net loss reserves for the first three months ended march 31 2005 and 2004 as follows data table removed includes accretion of discount of 97 million in the first three months of 2005 and 94 million in the first three months of 2004 additionally includes 55 million in the first three months of 2005 and 45 million in the first three months of 2004 for the general reinsurance operations of transatlantic and 118 million of additional losses incurred in the first three months of 2005 resulting from increased labor and material costs related to the 2004 florida hurricanes in a very broad sense the general insurance loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups one group is long tail casualty lines of business which include excess and umbrella liability d and o professional liability medical malpractice workers compensation general liability products liability and related classes the other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines for operations writing short tail coverages such as property coverages the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes is geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve level for the outstanding exposure rather than determining an expected loss ratio for current business for example the ibnr reserve required for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest years earned premiums and this level of reserve would be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the current quarter the 20 percent factor is adjusted to reflect changes in rate levels loss reporting patterns known exposures to large unreported losses or other factors affecting the particular class of business estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses net losses for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors including the line and volume of the business involved experience in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses because a 45 american international group inc and subsidiaries relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid therefore ibnr would constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses aigs carried net long tail loss reserves are tested using loss trend factors that aig considers most appropriate for each class of business a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions is normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines these methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next for the majority of long tail casualty lines net loss trend factors approximated five percent loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling exposure and policy forms current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted as appropriate to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience thus many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs recognized a number of actuarial assumptions are made in the review of reserves for each line of business for longer tail lines of business actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following loss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years expected loss ratios for the latest accident year i e accident year 2004 for the year end 2004 loss reserve analysis and in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years adjusted for the loss trend see above and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors for low frequency high severity classes such as excess casualty and d and o expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years loss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis aig records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its many general insurance profit centers the overall change in aigs loss reserves is based on the sum of these profit center level changes for most profit centers which write longer tail classes of casualty coverage the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage this loss ratio is multiplied by the current quarters net earned premium for that class of coverage to determine the quarters total estimated net incurred loss and loss expense the change in loss reserves for the quarter for each class is thus the difference between the net incurred loss and loss expense estimated as described above and the net paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter the process of determining the current loss ratio for each class or business segment begins in the profit centers in the latter part of the previous year the loss ratios determined for each profit center are based on a variety of factors these include but are not limited to the following considerations prior accident year and policy year loss ratios actual and anticipated rate changes actual and anticipated changes in coverage reinsurance or mix of business actual and anticipated changes in external factors affecting results such as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment each profit centers loss ratio for the following year is subject to review by the profit centers management by actuarial and accounting staffs and ultimately by senior management at the close of each quarter the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios based thereon remain appropriate this process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter actual rate changes achieved actual changes in coverage reinsurance or mix of business and changes in certain other factors that may affect the loss ratio when this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate the loss ratio for current business would be changed to reflect the revised assumptions a comprehensive annual loss reserve review is conducted in the fourth quarter of each year for each aig general insurance subsidiary these reviews are conducted in full detail for each class or line of business for each subsidiary and thus consist of literally hundreds of individual analyses the purpose of these reviews is to confirm the reasonableness of the reserves carried by each of the individual subsidiaries and thereby of aigs overall carried reserves the reserve analysis for each business class is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business in completing these detailed actuarial reserve analyses the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions including for example the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors they are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial method s to employ for each business class additionally they must determine the appropriate segmentation of data or segments from which the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately tested in the course of these detailed reserve reviews for each business segment a point estimate of the loss reserve is generally determined the sum of these point estimates for each of the individual business classes for each subsidiary provides an overall actuarial point estimate of the loss reserve for that subsidiary the overall actuarial point estimate is compared to the subsidiarys carried loss reserve if the carried reserve can be supported by actuarial methods and assumptions which are also believed to be reasonable then the carried reserve would generally be considered reasonable and no adjustment would be considered the ultimate process by which the actual carried reserves are determined considers not only the actuarial 46 american international group inc and subsidiaries point estimate but a myriad of other factors other crucial internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions in the united states and abroad changes in the legal regulatory judicial and social environments underlying policy pricing terms and conditions and claims handling loss reserve development can also be affected by commutations of assumed and ceded reinsurance agreements with respect to the 2004 year end actuarial loss reserve analysis for dbg the actuaries continued to utilize the modified assumptions which gave additional weight to actual loss development from the more recent years as identified during the 2002 and 2003 analysis with appropriate adjustments to account for the additional year of loss experience which emerged in 2004 although the actuaries continued to use actuarial assumptions that rely on expected loss ratios based on the results of prior accident years the expected loss ratio assumptions used continue to give far greater weight to the more recent accident year experience than was the case in the prior year end assumptions for example for the excess casualty lead umbrella class of business 100 percent weight was given to the experience of accident years 1998 2001 with no weight given to the more favorable experience of accident years prior to 1998 aigs annual loss reserve review does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates because a large portion of the loss reserves from aigs general insurance business relates to long tail casualty lines driven by severity rather than frequency of claims such as excess casualty and d and o developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful an estimate is calculated which aigs actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve this amount is then evaluated against actual carried reserves there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves particularly for long tail casualty classes of business such as excess casualty when actual costs differ from the assumptions used to test the reserves such assumptions include those made for loss trend factors and loss development factors as described earlier set forth below is a sensitivity analysis demonstrating the estimated effect on the loss reserve position of alternative loss trend or loss development factor assumptions as compared to those actually used to test the carried reserves for the excess casualty class of business the assumed loss cost trend was five percent thus in establishing the expected loss ratios for accident years 2002 through 2004 the loss costs from accident years 1998 through 2001 were trended by this five percent factor per annum a five percent change in the assumed loss cost trend from each accident year to the next would cause approximately a 600 million change either positively or negatively to the net loss and loss expense reserve for this business for the d and o and related management liability classes of business the assumed loss cost trend was four percent thus in establishing the expected loss ratios for accident years 2002 through 2004 the loss costs from accident years 1997 through 2001 were trended by this four percent factor per annum a five percent change in this assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a 500 million change either positively or negatively to the net loss and loss expense reserve for such business for healthcare liability business including hospitals and other healthcare exposures a five percent change in the assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a 150 million change either positively or negatively to the loss and loss expense reserve for this business actual loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for these classes whereas in the late 1990s loss costs trends ran well into the double digits for each of these three classes the sharp increase in loss costs in the late 1990s was thus much greater than the five percent changes cited above and caused significant increases in the overall loss reserve needs for these classes while changes in the loss cost trend assumptions can have a significant effect on the reserve needs for other smaller classes of liability business the potential effect of these changes on aigs overall carried reserves would be much less than for the classes noted above loss reserves pertaining to the excess casualty class of business are generally included in the other liability occurrence line of business with a small portion of the excess casualty reserves included in the other liability claims made line of business as presented in the table on page 44 for the excess casualty class if future loss development factors differed by five percent from those utilized in the year end 2004 loss reserve review there would be approximately a 450 million change either positively or negatively to the overall aig loss reserve position the comparable effect on the d and o and related management liability classes would be approximately 200 million either positively or negatively if future loss development factors differed by five percent from those utilized in the year end 2004 loss reserve review for healthcare liability classes the effect would be approximately 125 million either positively or negatively for workers compensation reserves the effect of a five percent deviation from the loss development factors utilized in the year end 2004 reserve reviews would be approximately 750 million either positively or negatively because loss development factors for this class have shown less volatility than higher severity classes such as excess casualty however actual changes in loss development factors are expected to be less than five percent there is some degree of volatility in loss development patterns for other longer tail liability classes as well however the potential effect on aigs reserves would be much less than for the classes cited above the calculations of the effect of the five percent change in loss development factors are made by selecting the stage of accident year development where it is believed reasonable for such a deviation to occur for example for workers compensation the 750 million amount is calculated by assuming 47 american international group inc and subsidiaries that each of the most recent eight accident years develop five percent higher than estimated by the current loss development factors utilized in the reserve study i e the factor 1 05 is multiplied by the incurred losses including ibnr and loss expenses for these accident years aig management believes that using a five percent change in the assumptions for loss cost trends and loss development factors provides a reasonable benchmark for a sensitivity analysis of the reserves of aigs most significant lines of general insurance business for excess casualty business both the loss cost trend and the loss development factor assumptions are critical generally actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development however there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past moreover as excess casualty is a long tail class of business any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year thus there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in the loss cost trends or loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves these changes in loss trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment or in other social or economic phenomena affecting claims for example during the lengthy periods during which losses develop for excess casualty actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the next have ranged from negative values to double digit amounts thus there is the potential for significant volatility in loss costs for excess casualty and although five percent is considered a reasonable benchmark for sensitivity analysis for this business there is the potential for variations far greater than this amount either positively or negatively likewise in the judgment of aigs actuaries five percent is considered an appropriate benchmark for sensitivity analysis with respect to the loss development factor assumptions used to test the reserves it should be noted that the loss cost trend factor for excess casualty was reduced to five percent in the year end 2004 loss reserve review compared to the 7 5 percent loss trend factor used in the 2003 review for excess casualty this reduction was made by aigs actuaries in response to a significant favorable loss trend that had emerged from accident year 2000 to 2001 this favorable trend appears to be continuing in accident years 2002 and 2003 although these accident years are still immature loss reserves pertaining to d and o and related management liability classes of business are included in the other liability claims made line of business as presented in the table on page 44 for d and o and related management liability classes of business the loss cost trend assumption is critical the loss development factor assumption is important but less critical than for excess casualty as this coverage is written on a claims made basis claims for a given accident year are all reported within that year actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the next in the 1990s ranged from double digit negative values for several accident years in the early 1990s to nearly 50 percent per year for the period from accident year 1996 to accident year 1999 thus there is the potential for extreme volatility in loss costs for this business and although five percent is considered a reasonable benchmark for sensitivity analysis there is the potential for variations far greater than this amount either positively or negatively five percent is also considered an appropriate benchmark for sensitivity analysis with respect to the loss development factor assumptions used to test the reserves for these classes however as noted above the effect of such a deviation is less than that of a similar deviation in loss cost trends it should be noted that the loss cost trend factor for d and o and related management liability classes was reduced to four percent in the year end 2004 loss reserve reviews compared to six percent in the 2003 review this reduction was made by aigs actuaries in response to a relative stabilization in loss costs from accident year 1999 to 2001 following the period of sharp increases in loss costs through 1999 the stabilization in loss costs appears to be continuing in accident years 2002 and 2003 although these accident years are still immature for healthcare liability classes both the loss cost trend and the loss development factor assumptions are critical the nature of the potential volatility would be analogous to that described above for the excess casualty business however aigs volume of business in the healthcare classes is much smaller than for excess casualty hence the potential effect on aigs overall reserves is smaller for these classes than for excess casualty aigs healthcare liability business includes both primary and excess exposures for workers compensation the loss development factor assumptions are important generally aigs actual historical workers compensation loss development would be expected to provide a reasonably accurate predictor of future loss development a five percent sensitivity indicator for workers compensation would thus be considered to be toward the high end of potential deviations for this class of business aigs workers compensation reserves include a small portion relating to excess workers compensation coverage the analysis applicable to excess casualty would apply to these reserves however the volume of such business is de minimis compared to the volume of excess casualty the loss cost trend assumption for workers compensation is not believed to be material with respect to aigs loss reserves other than for that portion representing excess workers compensation this is primarily because aigs actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident years reserves so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for workers compensation business 48 american international group inc and subsidiaries for casualty business other than the classes noted above there is generally some potential for deviation in both the loss cost trend and loss development factor selections however the effect of such deviations would not be material when compared to the effect cited above for excess casualty and d and o the comprehensive annual loss reserve review process results in an accumulation of point estimates for aigs general insurance business the loss reserve carried at year end 2004 for aigs general insurance business was approximately equal to the aggregate reserve indicated by the actuarial point estimates this represents a relative improvement of approximately two percent from aigs position as of december 31 2003 this comparison excludes the reserves relating to asbestos and environmental exposures which are determined using different methodologies as described below asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures aig continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste hazardous substances and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites referred to collectively as environmental claims and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years commencing in 1985 standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented however aig currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and has excluded such claims from the analysis herein the majority of aigs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages not primary coverages thus the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves that is litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability aig incurs individual significant claim liabilities where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable are established on a case basis estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a subjective process and reserves for asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated using conventional reserving techniques such as those that rely on historical accident year loss development factors significant factors which affect the trends that influence the asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage the current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future additionally the exposures for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties due to this uncertainty it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as with other types of claims such future development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage as they have in the past as well as by the changes in superfund and waste dump site coverage issues if the asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse effect on aigs future results of operations aig does not discount asbestos and environmental reserves with respect to known asbestos and environmental claims aig established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claims units which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims these units evaluate these asbestos and environmental claims utilizing a claim by claim approach that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues aig generally evaluates exposure on a policy by policy basis considering a variety of factors such as known facts current law jurisdiction policy language and other factors that are unique to each policy quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management judgment each claim is reviewed at least semi annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information in both the specialized and dedicated asbestos and environmental claims units aig actively manages and pursues early settlement with respect to these claims in an attempt to mitigate its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims aig attempts to mitigate its known long tail environmental exposures by utilizing a combination of proactive claim handling techniques including policy buybacks complete environmental releases compromise settlements and where indicated litigation with respect to asbestos claims handling aigs specialized claims staff operates to mitigate losses through proactive handling supervision and resolution of asbestos cases thus while aig has resolved all claims with respect to miners and 49 american international group inc and subsidiaries major manufacturers tier one its claims staff continues to operate under the same proactive philosophy to resolve claims involving accounts with products containing asbestos tier two products containing small amounts of asbestos companies in the distribution process and parties with remote ill defined involvement in asbestos tiers three and four through its commitment to appropriate staffing training and management oversight of asbestos cases aig mitigates to the extent possible its exposure to these claims in order to evaluate the overall reasonableness of the asbestos and environmental reserves established using the claim by claim approach as described above aig uses two methods the market share method and the frequency severity or report year method the market share method produces indicated asbestos and environmental reserve needs by applying the appropriate aig market share to estimated potential industry ultimate loss and loss expenses based on the latest estimates from a m best and tillinghast the market share method is a series of tests six estimates of potential industry ultimate losses for asbestos and environmental claims are tested additionally a second series of tests are performed using estimated industry unpaid losses instead of industry ultimate losses the market share tests are also performed using estimates of aigs market share the reason aigs market share is an estimate is that there are assumptions as to which years and classes of business the asbestos and environmental exposure applies for example commercial multiple peril business is included in the market share calculation in some but not all of the scenarios aigs estimate of the carried net asbestos and environmental reserves were approximately 50 million greater than the mean indication of the outcomes of market share testing however the market share method does not give weight to aigs actual asbestos and environmental loss experience the frequency severity or report year approach is also a series of tests which are performed separately for asbestos and for environmental exposures for asbestos these tests project the expected losses to be reported over the next twenty years i e from 2005 through 2024 based on the actual losses reported through 2004 and the expected future loss emergence for these claims three scenarios are tested with a series of assumptions ranging from more optimistic to more conservative in the first scenario all carried asbestos case reserves as determined above using the claim by claim approach are assumed to be within ten percent of their ultimate settlement value the second scenario relies on an actuarial projection of report year developments for asbestos claims reported from 1993 to the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year end 2004 the third scenario also relies on an actuarial projection of report year claims for asbestos but reflects claims reported from 1989 to the present to estimate case reserve adequacy as of year end 2004 as of year end 2004 the results of the second and third scenarios varied significantly in the second scenario case reserves were indicated to be at slightly less than 60 percent of the ultimate settlement value at year end 2004 whereas in the third scenario they were indicated to be at less than 25 percent of ultimate settlement value based on the results of the prior report years for each of the three scenarios described above the report year approach then projects forward to the year 2024 the expected future report year losses based on aigs estimate of reasonable loss trend assumptions these calculations are performed on losses gross of reinsurance the ibnr including a provision for development of reported claims on a net basis is based on applying a factor reflecting the expected ratio of net losses to gross losses for future loss emergence for environmental claims an analogous series of frequency severity tests are produced in general the case reserve adequacy assumptions are narrower as case reserve adequacy is indicated within approximately 25 percent of adequacy in all scenarios tested environmental claims from future report years i e ibnr are projected out ten years i e through the year 2014 as of year end 2004 the range of outcomes from the scenarios tested for environmental ranged from 20 million below aigs carried reserve to approximately 200 million greater than aigs carried reserve the range of outcomes for asbestos was greater the indication from the first scenario as described above was approximately 140 million below aigs carried reserve the indication from the second scenario was approximately 10 million below aigs carried reserves the indication from the third scenario was approximately 650 million greater than aigs carried reserve at year end 2004 aig considered a number of factors and recent experience to determine the appropriate reserve that should be carried for these claims including the following 1 actual calendar experience for past ten years five years three years and one year aig experienced consistent adverse development on its carried asbestos and environmental reserves over the years the net carried reserves from ten years ago ran off 1 45 billion deficient from five years ago 430 million deficient from three years ago 350 million deficient and from one year ago 150 million deficient thus the reserves consistently produced adverse development per year with no evidence of recent improvement these figures are prior to the year end 2004 reserve increase on a gross of reinsurance basis the adverse developments were analogous with approximately 450 million in the latest year and 4 8 billion over the past ten years 50 american international group inc and subsidiaries 2 input from claims officers on latest year events dbgs claims officers observed an increasing trend toward adverse claims experience in the layers underlying its excess attachment points for a number of tier two claims increasing the probability of further adverse loss developments going forward they also noted the emergence of several asbestos non products cases recently raising a concern that asbestos non products cases could become a more serious problem in the future 3 deterioration in report year claims experience as noted above the scenario two and scenario three indications for case reserve adequacy in aigs 2004 year end actuarial report indicated an increasing deficiency in carried case reserves for asbestos this was the result of continued adverse development on prior year case reserves and suggests future loss development will be at higher levels than previously indicated as a result the scenario three indicated reserve deficiency increased from approximately 480 million in the 2003 year end reserve review to a deficiency of approximately 650 million in the year end 2004 review furthermore the year end 2004 review utilized data evaluated as of june 30 2004 an update to this data was produced for all large claims with claims evaluated as of march 31 2005 i e an additional nine months of data beyond the year end 2004 reserve study this update showed that report year losses in the nine months from june 2004 to march 2005 produced additional adverse loss development in fact more loss development was observed during these nine months than for the twelve months from the june 2003 through june 2004 period thus both the latest years data used in the year end 2004 actuarial study and the nine months of additional data subsequent to that study indicated the experience was deteriorating beyond what was expected at year end 2003 4 survival ratios aigs year end 2004 survival ratio for asbestos was 5 7 and 5 2 on a gross and a net basis respectively prior to the year end 2004 reserve increase aigs year end 2004 survival ratio for environmental was 4 8 and 3 8 on a gross and a net basis respectively prior to the year end 2004 reserve increase these survival ratios indicated aigs carried reserves were sufficient to fund four to five years of payments for these claims assuming payment levels remain stable based on the latest two years of actual paid losses aig did not expect its losses to decline as quickly as these ratios imply 5 industry experience the industry has experienced a significant wave of adverse development for asbestos since 2001 with little if any signs of recent improvement furthermore the litigation environment has become increasingly adverse 6 reinsurance recoverable although aig has been successful in collecting the vast majority of its reinsurance on asbestos and environmental claims the greater the future losses and the longer the exposure persists the greater the likelihood of increased problems in collecting reinsurance thus the continued adverse developments and lack of any signs that loss experience is beginning to diminish increases the risk of uncollectible reinsurance after considering all of these factors particularly its recent experience aig determined that its carried reserve for asbestos and environmental claims would be best estimated by scenario three described above this resulted in a 650 million increase in net asbestos reserves and a 200 million increase in net environmental reserves the corresponding increases in gross reserves were 1 2 billion for asbestos and 250 million for environmental reserves significant uncertainty remains as to aigs ultimate liability relating to asbestos and environmental claims this uncertainty is due to several factors including data table removed 51 american international group inc and subsidiaries a summary of

carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average

months of 2005 as deposits declined approximately nine percent compared to the same period in 2004 and operating income for the retirement services businesses remained relatively flat when compared with the first three months of 2004 the sales environment for the first three months of 2005 for individual variable annuities was unfavorably affected by the combination of weak equity market performance and the cumulative effect of more restrictive regulatory compliance procedures imposed by the broker dealer and bank distributors in recent periods aigs domestic fixed annuity business has been affected by a significant flattening of the treasury yield curve over the past several quarters which has affected sales as yields on competing products such as bank cds approach those available on aigs fixed annuities there are some indications that negative press coverage of aig has adversely affected surrenders and withdrawals of fixed annuities in addition surrenders have increased from prior year levels as annuities sold in 2000 can now be surrendered without charges and as a result of the competitive interest rate environment the combination of reduced sales and increased surrenders and withdrawals resulted in significantly lower net flows when compared to prior year aig expects that net flows will remain lower than in prior years as long as an environment of poor equity market performance and the yield curve remains flat the majority of the growth in life insurance and retirement services gaap premiums in foreign life operations was attributable to the life insurance personal accident and health and group products lines of business globally aigs deep and diverse distribution which includes bancassurance worksite marketing direct marketing and strong

all 2 5 billion was outstanding as of september 30 2005 the letter of credit facility has a ten year term but the facility can be reduced or terminated by the lenders beginning after seven years the investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets primarily long term fixed rate investments being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments see also the discussion under liquidity herein to minimize its exposure to investment risk aig tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit if a necessary rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims does not occur a demand could be placed upon liquidity see also the discussion under liquidity herein aig actively manages the asset liability relationship in its foreign operations as it has been doing throughout aigs history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or certain local regulatory authorities may impose investment restrictions for example in japan and several southeast asian countries the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities additionally there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts while continuing to maintain satisfactory investment quality certain foreign jurisdictions including japan have limited long dated bond markets and aig may use alternative investments including equities real estate and foreign currency denominated fixed income instruments to extend the effective duration and increase the yield of the investment portfolio to more closely match the requirements of the policyholder liabilities and dac recoverability particularly in taiwan where nan shan has approximately 30 percent of invested assets in foreign currencies using foreign currency denominated investments to support policyholder liabilities could increase the risk to and volatility of cash flows and income aig actively manages this risk through regular monitoring and selected hedging strategies aig actively manages the asset liability relationship in its domestic operations this relationship is more easily man 55 american international group inc and subsidiaries aged through the ample supply of qualified long term investments aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes in addition the absence of long dated fixed income instruments in certain markets may preclude a matched asset liability position in those markets a number of guaranteed benefits are offered on certain variable life and variable annuity products dac for life insurance and retirement services products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new or renewal business policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy policy acquisition costs which relate to universal life and investment type products including variable and fixed annuities investment oriented products are deferred and amortized with interest as appropriate in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts with respect to universal life and investment oriented products aigs policy as appropriate has been to adjust amortization assumptions for dac when estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from these contracts are revised with respect to variable annuities sold domestically representing the vast majority of aigs variable annuity business the assumption for the long term annual net growth rate of the equity markets used in the determination of dac amortization is approximately ten percent a methodology referred to as reversion to the mean is used to maintain this long term net growth rate assumption while giving consideration to short term variations in equity markets estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less interest required as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the effect on the amortization of dac the estimation of projected gross profits requires significant management judgment the elements with respect to the current and projected gross profits are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are adjusted appropriately aigs variable annuity earnings will be affected by changes in market returns because separate account revenues primarily composed of mortality and expense charges and asset management fees are a function of asset values dac for both insurance oriented and investment oriented products as well as retirement services products are subject to review for recoverability which involve estimating the future profitability of current business this review also involves significant management judgment if the actual emergence of future profitability were to be substantially different than that estimated aigs results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods 56 american

variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date valuation of invested assets aig has the ability to hold any fixed maturity security to its stated maturity including those fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale therefore the decision to sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflects the judgment of aigs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale the valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market value for each security the source for the market value is generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of nontraded securities if aig chooses to hold a security it evaluates the security for an impairment in valuation as a matter of policy the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of aigs management and a continual review of its investments 60 american international group inc and subsidiaries in general a security is considered a candidate for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant 25 percent or more discount to par amortized cost if lower or cost for an extended period of time nine months or longer the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation or ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or in the opinion of aigs management it is possible that aig may not realize a full recovery on its investment irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price and recorded as a charge to earnings as a result of these policies aig recorded impairment losses net of taxes of 61 million and 79 million in the first three months of 2005 and 2004 respectively no impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to aigs consolidated financial condition or results of operations and no individual impairment loss exceeded 1 0 percent of consolidated net income for the first three months of 2005 excluding the other than temporary impairments noted above the changes in market value for aigs

accounting as described in fas 133 is not 63 american international group inc and subsidiaries currently being applied to any of the derivatives and related assets and liabilities accordingly revenues and operating income are exposed to volatility resulting from differences in the timing of revenue recognition between the derivatives and the hedged assets and liabilities revenues of the capital markets operations and the percentage change in revenues for any given period are significantly affected by the number and size of transactions entered into by these subsidiaries during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period as well as the volatility noted above for the accounting under fas 133 operating income and the percentage change in operating income for any period are determined by the number size and profitability of the transactions attributable to that period relative to those attributable to the prior period as well as the volatility noted above for the accounting under fas 133 generally the realization of trading revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on aigfps trading transactions are currently reflected in operating income as the fair values change from period to period derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of capital markets operations therefore income on interest rate currency equity commodity and credit derivatives along with their related hedges is recorded at fair value determined by references to the mark to market value of the derivative or their estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available the resulting aggregate unrealized gains or losses from the derivative is reflected in the income statement in the current year in the first quarter of 2005 less than five percent of revenues resulted from transactions valued at estimated fair value where capital markets cannot verify significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model value to market transactions capital markets values the contract at the transaction price at inception and consequently records no initial gain or loss in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 02 3 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf 02 3 such initial gain or loss is amortized into income over the life of the transaction capital markets periodically reevaluates its revenue recognition under eitf 02 3 based on the observability of market parameters the mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the captions unrealized gain on swaps options and forward transactions and unrealized loss on swaps options and forward transactions unrealized gains represent the present value of the aggregate of each net receivable by counterparty and the unrealized losses represent the present value of the aggregate of each net payable by counterparty as of march 31 2005 these amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates currency rates equity and commodity prices and other market variables as well as cash movements execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions see also the discussion under derivatives herein spread income on investments and borrowings is recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the transaction investments are classified as securities available for sale and are marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income u s dollar denominated borrowings are carried at cost while borrowings in any currency other than the u s dollar result in unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses reported in income aigfp hedges the economic exposure on its investments and borrowings through its derivatives portfolio the requirements under fas 133 hedge accounting were not met for certain of these hedge transactions for the period ended march 31 2005 thus these hedges are marked to fair value with the unrealized gains or losses reported in income consumer finance domestically aigs consumer finance operations derive a substantial portion of their revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding

operations for the three month periods ending march 31 2005 and 2004 were as follows data table removed data table removed financial services results financial services operating income increased in the first three months of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004 due to strong results in all the businesses and the accounting effect of fas 133 fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of capital markets operations and the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting under fas 133 to the extent the financial services subsidiaries other than aigfp use derivatives to hedge their assets or liabilities with respect to their future cash flows and such hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 the changes in fair value of such derivatives are recorded in realized capital gains losses or other revenues financial market conditions in the first three months of 2005 compared with the same period of 2004 were characterized by a general flattening of interest rate curves across fixed income markets globally some tightening of credit spreads and equity valuations that were broadly unchanged capital markets results in 2005 compared with 2004 reflected a shift in product segment activity to respond to these conditions the most significant component of capital markets operating expenses is compensation which was approximately 111 million and 114 million in the first three months of 2005 and 2004 respectively the amount of compensation was not affected by gains and losses not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 with respect to ilfc the revenue growth in the first three months of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004 resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment under operating lease and the increase in the relative value of the leased fleet ilfc continued to see net improvements in lease rates and an increasing level of interest from traditional buyers third party investors and debt providers for the purchase of aircraft from ilfcs extensive lease portfolio thus the outlook for the remainder of 2005 is positive in connection with a global aircraft lease transaction entered into in 2000 for a total of 14 aircraft ilfc acquired certain securities of and issued certain guarantees to ata airlines and related entities ata during the fourth quarter of 2004 ata filed for protection under chapter 11 of the u s bankruptcy code on the basis of estimates of the probable outcome of the ata

reported as a realized capital loss and did not have a material effect on aigs results of operations financial condition or liquidity ata has cured all of the defaults under the existing leases and continues to perform under the leases at the pre bankruptcy contracted lease terms consumer finance operations both domestically and internationally did very well with increased revenues and operating income the increase in consumer finance revenues in 2005 was the result of growth in average finance receivables credit quality of those receivables continues to be strong foreign consumer finance operations performed well as the operations in poland continued its strong growth and the hong kong credit card business benefited from the strengthening local economy resulting in less need for loan loss provisions further the continuing low interest rate and charge off environment led to an improvement in the operating income in 2005 over 2004 financial services operating income represented 18 5 percent of aigs consolidated income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes in the first quarter of 2005 this compares to 15 2 percent in the first quarter of 2004 the increase in contribution percentage in 2005 was due to the effect of hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 65 american international group inc and subsidiaries financial services invested

services operations capital resources and derivatives herein data table removed as previously discussed the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ilfcs debt financings the primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt during the first three months of 2005 ilfc acquired flight equipment costing 2 14 billion see also the discussion under operating review financial services operations and capital resources herein aigs consumer finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and overseas such products include real estate mortgages consumer loans and retail sales finance these products are funded through deposits and various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes aigs consumer finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties with respect to credit losses the allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio capital markets derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available aigfp reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps trading securities options forwards and futures the estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows these transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if aigfp were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that the effect of any such event would not be significant to aigs financial condition or its overall liquidity see also the discussion under operating review financial services operations and derivatives herein aigfp uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and gia borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities including securities available for sale at market and derivative transactions the funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell the proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing gias or other aigfp financings or invest in new assets see also the discussion under capital resources herein securities available for sale is predominantly a portfolio of fixed income securities where the individual securities have varying degrees of credit risk at march 31 2005 the 66 american international group inc and subsidiaries average credit rating of this portfolio was aa or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review aigfp has also entered into credit derivative transactions to economically hedge its credit risk associated with 149 million of these securities there have been no significant downgrades through march 31 2005 aigfps risk management objective is to minimize interest rate currency commodity and equity risks associated with its securities available for sale that is when aigfp purchases a security for its securities available for sale investment portfolio it simultaneously enters into an offsetting internal hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction offset the payment terms of the investment security which achieves the economic result of converting the return on the underlying security to usd libor plus or minus a spread based on the underlying profit on each security on the initial trade date the market risk associated with such internal hedges is managed on a portfolio basis with third party hedging transactions executed as necessary as hedge accounting treatment is not achieved in accordance with fas 133 the unrealized gains and losses on these securities resulting from changes in interest rates currency rates commodity and equity prices are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income while the unrealized gains and losses on the related economic hedges are reflected in operating income when a security is sold the related hedging transaction is terminated the realized gain or loss with respect to each security is then recorded in operating income securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized financing transactions aigfp takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell aigfp further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and when it deems necessary it requires additional collateral to be deposited aigfp is exposed to credit risk if its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform aigfp could have a liquidity strain aig guarantees aigfps payment obligations including its debt obligations aigfp also conducts as principal market making and trading activities in foreign exchange and commodities primarily precious metals aigfp owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps forwards futures and option contracts aigfp uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices aigfp supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities unrealized losses on swaps short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased see also the discussions under capital resources the gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of capital markets included in the financial services assets and liabilities at march 31 2005 were as follows data table removed these amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts trading securities at market value and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time these trading securities are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of capital markets operations the senior management of aig defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for capital markets operations aigs senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market operational and credit issues of the capital markets operations the senior management of aigfp reports the results of its operations to and reviews future strategies with aigs senior management aig actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities in doing so aig must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit market liquidity operational and legal risks at march 31 2005 aigfp held a large portfolio of privately negotiated financing transactions with institutional counterparties in the united kingdom certain provisions in the uk finance bill that was published by the house of commons on march 22 2005 have caused aigfps counterparties to exercise rights to unwind these transactions early although the unwinding of these transactions will not cause aigfp to suffer any losses the unwinds do mean that aigfp will not realize spread income in the future that aigfp expects it would have realized had the transactions remained outstanding the aggregate reduction in 2005 operating income attributable to such foregone future accrual earnings was approximately 75 million asset management operations aigs asset management operations comprise a wide variety of investment related services and investment products including institutional and retail asset management broker dealer services and spread

partner earnings offset in minority interest expense asset management results asset management operating income increased in the first three months of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004 as a result of a strong global product portfolio the operating income growth results from fees related to the management of mutual funds and various investment portfolios that are in great part contingent upon the growth in the equity markets and customer interest in equity sensitive products thus as equity markets expand and contract the appetite for listed and private equity investment changes the revenues and operating income with respect to this segment are similarly affected gics are sold domestically and abroad to both institutions and individuals these products are written on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are favorable gic revenues include income from sunamerica partnerships supporting the gic line of business and are significantly affected by performance in the equity markets thus revenues operating income and cash flow attributable to gics will vary from one reporting period to the next growth in gic operating income compared to the first quarter of 2004 reflects improved partnership returns and increased assets under management partially offset by spread compression on the core gic portfolio spread compression has occurred as the base portfolio yield declined due to declining interest rates and the effect of recognizing capital gains in prior periods and also due to an increase in the cost of funds in the short term floating rate portion of the gic portfolio only partially offset by increased investment income from the floating rate assets backing the portfolio aig expects to launch a matched investment program utilizing issuances of aig

operating results or liquidity as a result of the downgrades of aigs long term senior debt ratings aig was required to post approximately 1 16 billion of collateral with counterparties to municipal

substantial additional collateral which could have a material effect on how aig manages its liquidity the actual amount of additional collateral that aig would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions the market value of the outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade any additional obligations

laws regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses aigs u s operations are negatively affected under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states as a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state aig generally records these assessments upon notice additionally certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities therefore the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated the guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2004 were 118 million aig is also required to participate in various involuntary pools principally workers compensation business which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets this participation is also recorded upon notification as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated a substantial portion of aigs general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance and retirement services business are conducted in foreign countries the degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies generally aig as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements licenses issued by foreign authorities to aig subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation thus aigs insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate aigs international operations include operations in various developing nations both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of aigs operations without compensation adverse effects resulting from any one country may affect aigs results of operations liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and aigs net financial exposure at that time in that country foreign operations are individually subject to local solvency margin requirements that require maintenance of adequate capitalization which aig complies with by country in addition certain foreign locations notably japan have established regulations that can result in guarantee fund assessments these have not had a material effect on aigs operations liquidity aigs liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance and retirement services operations management believes that aigs liquid assets and access to short term funding through commercial paper and 73 american international group inc and subsidiaries bank credit facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated cash requirements at march 31 2005 aigs consolidated invested assets included 24 38 billion of cash and short term investments consolidated net cash used in operating activities in the first three months of 2005 amounted to 434 million the 434 million in consolidated net cash used in operating activities is net of approximately 8 billion used by aigfp to purchase securities purchased under agreements to resell and to repurchase securities sold under agreements to repurchase in the ordinary course of aigfps business this operating activity was funded in part by proceeds from security sales under similar repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements but primarily by aigfps financing activities specifically proceeds from guaranteed investment agreements and notes bonds loans and mortgages payable approximately half of the 8 billion was subsequently invested in securities available for sale the liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad the combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources underwriting operations and investment operations cash flow includes periodic premium collections including policyholders contract deposits cash flows from investment operations and paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums losses benefits and acquisition and operating expenses generally there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy the losses and benefits are paid investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses see also the discussions under operating review general insurance operations and life insurance and retirement services operations herein with respect to general insurance operations if paid losses accelerated beyond aigs ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows aig might need to liquidate a portion of its general insurance investment portfolio and or arrange for financing potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several significant catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value see also the discussions under operating review general insurance operations herein with respect to life insurance and retirement services operations if a substantial portion of the life insurance and retirement services operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and or defaulted aig might need to liquidate other portions of its life insurance and retirement services investment portfolio and or arrange financing potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which aig life insurance and retirement services operations exist nationalization terrorist acts or other such economic or political upheaval in addition a significant rise in interest rates leading to a significant increase in policyholder surrenders could also create a liquidity strain see also the discussions under operating review life insurance and retirement services operations herein in addition to the combined insurance pretax operating cash flow aigs insurance operations held 13 18 billion in cash and short term investments at march 31 2005 operating cash flow and the cash and short term balances held provided aigs insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity this liquidity is available among other things to purchase predominately high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate policy loans and collateral loans this cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately 33 billion from the maturities sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately 46 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during the first three months of 2005 aigs major financial services operating subsidiaries consist of aigfp ilfc agf and aigcfg sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of aigfps operations include execution of guaranteed investment agreements issuance of long term and short term debt proceeds from maturities and sales of securities available for sale securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased ilfc agf and aigcfg all utilize the commercial paper markets bank loans and bank credit facilities as sources of liquidity ilfc and agf also fund in the domestic and international capital markets without reliance on any guarantee from aig an additional source of liquidity for ilfc is the use of export credit facilities aigcfg also uses wholesale and retail bank deposits as sources of funds on occasion aig has provided equity

herein and also note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements also for additional disclosure regarding aigs commercial commitments including guarantors see contractual obligations and other commercial commitments herein derivatives derivatives are financial instruments among two or more parties with returns linked to or derived from some underlying equity debt commodity or other asset liability or index derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities certain commodities financial or commodity indices or other variables the more significant types of derivative arrangements in which aig transacts are swaps forwards futures and options in the normal course of business with the agreement of the original counterparty these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty the overwhelming majority of aigs derivatives activities are conducted by the capital markets operations thus permitting aig to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal in these derivative operations aig structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices aigs customers such as corporations financial institutions multinational organizations sovereign entities government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures for example a futures forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations a counterparty may default on any obligation to aig including a derivative contract credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to aig to help manage this risk aigfps credit department operates within the guidelines set and authorities granted by the aig credit risk committee this committee establishes the credit policy sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings in addition to credit ratings this committee takes into account other factors including the industry and country of the counterparty transactions which fall outside pre established guidelines and limits require the specific approval of the aig credit risk committee it is also aigs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary in addition aigfp utilizes various credit enhancements including letters of credit guarantees collateral credit triggers credit derivatives and margin agreements to reduce the credit risk relating to its outstanding derivative financial transactions aigfp requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on among other things the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transactions size and maturity aigs derivatives review committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction or program except those derivative transactions entered into by aigfp with third parties the committee examines among other things the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction its potential credit exposure if any and the estimated benefits fas 133 requires that third party derivatives used for hedging must be specifically matched with the underlying exposures to an outside third party and documented contem 75 american international group inc and subsidiaries poraneously to qualify for hedge accounting treatment in many cases aig did not meet these hedging requirements with respect to certain hedging transactions not meeting the requirements of fas 133 does not result in any changes in aigs liquidity or its overall financial condition even though inter period volatility of earnings increased managing market risk market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies equities and commodity prices aig has exposures to these risks aig analyzes market risk using various statistical techniques including value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that applies the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors to aigs market positions the output from the var calculation is the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models aig believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management insurance aig has performed a separate var analysis for the general insurance and life insurance and retirement services segments and for each market risk within each segment for purposes of the var calculation the insurance assets and liabilities from gics are included in the life insurance and retirement services segment for the calculations in the analyses the financial instrument assets included are the insurance segments invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued and the financial instrument liabilities included are reserve for losses and loss expenses reserve for unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and other policyholders funds aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aigs insurance segments as of march 31 2005 and december 31 2004 the var number represents the maximum potential loss that could be incurred with a 95 percent confidence i e only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure within a one month holding period aig uses the historical simulation methodology that entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period aig uses the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices for each scenario each transaction was repriced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values are then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of march 31 2005 and december 31 2004 due to diversification effects the combined var is always smaller than the sum of its components data table removed 76 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents the average high and low vars on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of march 31 2005 and december 31 2004 due to diversification effects the combined var is always smaller than the sum of its components data table removed financial services aig generally manages its market exposures within financial services by maintaining offsetting positions capital markets seeks to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered market positions credit exposure is managed separately see the discussion on the management of credit risk above aigs market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aigs market exposures particularly those market exposures of the capital markets operations this department determines whether aigs market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aigs senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary ilfc is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates as of march 31 2005 and december 31 2004 aig statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a var model in this analysis the net fair value of aircraft finance operations was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt the estimated effect of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of aircraft finance operations using the historical simulation methodology as previously described as of march 31 2005 and december 31 2004 the average var with respect to the net fair value of aircraft finance operations was approximately 76 million and 70 million respectively capital markets operations are exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices aigfp hedges its exposure to these risks primarily through swaps options forwards and futures to economically hedge interest rate risks aigfp may also purchase u s and foreign government obligations aigfp does not seek to manage the market risk of each transaction through an individual third party offsetting transaction rather aigfp takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposures aigfp values the predominant portion of its market sensitive transactions by marking them to market currently through income a smaller portion is priced by estimated fair value based upon a conservative extrapolation of market factors there is another limited portion of transactions where the initial fair value is not recorded through income currently and gains or losses are accrued over the life of the transactions these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfp and aig management aigfp manages market risk with a variety of transactions including swaps trading securities futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate the recorded values of these transactions may be different from the values that might be realized if aigfp were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations financial condition or liquidity such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity aigfp attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices such as published exchange prices external subscription services such as from bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available aigfp use an internal methodology which includes extrapolation from observable and verifiable 77 american international group inc and subsidiaries prices nearest to the dates of the transactions historically actual results have not materially deviated from these models systems used by capital markets operations can monitor each units respective market positions on an intraday basis aigfp operates in major business centers overseas and therefore is open for business essentially 24 hours a day thus the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored reviewed and coordinated around the clock aigfp applies various testing techniques which reflect significant potential market movements in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity and equity prices volatility levels and the effect of time these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio the results from these analyses are regularly reviewed by aig management as described above capital markets operations are exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices as well as implied volatilities thereon aig statistically measures the losses of fair value through the application of a var model across capital markets capital markets asset and liability portfolios for which the var analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments derivative instruments and commodities because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale at market is substantially hedged segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary the var calculation is unaffected by the accounting treatment of hedged transactions under fas 133 in the calculation of var for capital markets operations aig uses the same historical simulation methodology described under insurance above which entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period aigfp has recently enhanced its library of factors by including implied option volatilities to construct the historical scenarios for simulation the following table presents the var on a combined
