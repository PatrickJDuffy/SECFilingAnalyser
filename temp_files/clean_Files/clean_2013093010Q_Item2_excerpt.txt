throughout this md and a we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful representative and most transparent some of the measurements we use are non gaap financial measures under sec rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the non gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis we believe book value per common share excluding aoci is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of non cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio and foreign currency translation adjustments book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive overview section of this md and a we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of aig and our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided in the results of operations section of this md and a aig after tax operating income loss attributable to aig is derived by excluding the following items from net income loss

described above and bargain purchase gain underwriting income loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred acquisition expenses and general operating expenses ratios aig property casualty along with most property and casualty insurance companies uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of claims and claims adjustment expense and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and

ratio as adjusted which declined to 98 0 and 97 2 respectively compared to 100 1 and 99 6 in the same periods in the prior year the improvement in pre tax operating income also reflected lower catastrophe losses in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year net investment income declined in the three month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to decreases in returns on alternative investments and mutual funds however net investment income increased in the nine month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to an increase in alternative investment income and income associated with picc property and casualty company limited picc p and c shares aig life and retirement reported growth in assets under management since december 31 2012 from strong sales of variable annuities retail mutual funds and stable value wraps as well as strong equity market performance pre tax operating income improved in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 from effective spread management growth in fee income and adjustments to update certain estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize dac and related items in our interest sensitive product lines mortgage guaranty pre tax operating income improved in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 due to a decline in delinquency rates and improving cure rates new insurance written increased in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 due to the market acceptance of ugc risk based pricing model by an increasing number of lenders as well as the addition and expansion of distribution channels our investment portfolio performance excluding gains recognized in 2012 from our previous investments in maiden lane ii llc ml ii maiden lane iii llc ml iii and aia group limited aia declined in the three month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to a decrease in alternative investment income as a result of unfavorable equity market performance and the reinvestment of portfolio cash flows in a low interest rate environment the investment portfolio performance improved in the nine month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to an increase in alternative investment income largely as a result of favorable equity market performance in the nine month period ended september 30 2013 partially offset by the effect of our reinvestment in a low interest rate environment net realized capital gains declined in the three month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to relatively lower gains from sales of certain assets in unrealized gain positions as part of our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards net realized capital gains improved in the nine month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to relatively higher gains from sales of certain assets in unrealized gain positions as part of our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards and continued low levels of other than temporary impairments liquidity and capital resources 2013 highlights we reduced our debt in the first nine months of 2013 as a result of maturities repayments and repurchases of 7 6 billion partially offsetting this decrease was the issuance of 1 0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3 375 percent senior notes due 2020 we maintained financial flexibility in the first nine months of 2013 through 1 5 billion in cash dividends from aig property casualty subsidiaries and 3 1 billion in cash dividends and loan repayments from aig life and retirement subsidiaries our board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of aig common stock on august 1 2013 with an aggregate purchase price of up to 1 0 billion from time to time in the open market private purchases through forward derivative accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise during the three months

additional information data table removed 78 item 2 executive overview 79 table of contents item 2 executive overview investment highlights net investment income decreased 23 percent and 29 percent to 3 6 billion and 11 6 billion for the three month and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 compared to the prior year period respectively primarily due to gains recognized in 2012 from our previous investments in ml ii ml iii and aia net investment income for our insurance operations decreased by approximately 173 million and increased by approximately 234 million for the three month and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year the decrease for the three month period is due to lower returns on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields the increase for the nine month period is due to higher alternative investment income driven primarily by favorable equity market performance which was partially offset by gains recognized in 2012 from our previous investment in ml ii while corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations we continued to make investments in structured securities and fixed income securities with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio declined to approximately 13 billion as of september 30 2013 from approximately 25 billion as of december 31 2012 due to rising interest rates over the period and the realization of approximately 2 1 billion in gains from sales of securities other than temporary impairments were significantly lower for the nine month period ended september 30 2013 relative to the prior year period partly driven by strong performance in our structured products portfolios due to favorable developments in the housing sector the overall credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was largely unchanged for this quarter 80 item 2 executive overview presentation changes prior period revenues and expenses were conformed to the current period presentation these changes did not affect income from continuing operations before income tax expense or net income attributable to aig also the presentation of the operating segments within the aig life and retirement segment was revised in the first quarter of 2013 to reflect two new operating segments retail and institutional for further discussion see notes 1 and 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements strategic outlook industry trends our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates credit and equity market conditions catastrophic claims events regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continue to operate under difficult market conditions in 2013 characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates instability in the global markets due to the negotiations over the u s debt ceiling the u s government shutdown and slow growth in the u s economy although there has been a recent rise in interest rates in the u s fixed income market interest rates remain low relative to historical levels which has affected our industry by reducing investment returns in addition current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines aig priorities for 2013 and beyond aig remains focused on the following priorities for 2013 and beyond strengthen and improve the operating performance of our core businesses consummate the sale or monetization of our interest in ilfc enhance the yield on our investments while maintaining focus on credit quality manage our capital and interest expense more efficiently by improving our capital structure and redeploying excess capital in areas that promote profitable growth work with the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb in its capacity as our principal regulator and reduce operating expenses by leveraging our scale and driving increased standardization through investments in infrastructure outlook for our operating businesses the outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2013 and over the longer term is summarized below see our 2012 annual report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses 81 item 2 executive overview aig property casualty strategic initiatives and outlook executive overview business mix shift continue shifting toward higher value business to increase profitability and expand in attractive growth economies specifically in asia pacific central europe the middle east africa and latin america underwriting excellence enhance risk selection and pricing to earn returns commensurate to the risk assumed claims best practices implement improved claims practices and advanced technology to lower the loss ratio operating expense discipline apply operating expense discipline and increase efficiencies by taking full advantage of our global footprint capital efficiency continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency investment strategy continue to execute our investment strategy which includes increased asset diversification and yield enhancement opportunities that meet our liquidity risk and return objectives market conditions and industry trends we expect the current low interest rate environment and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets due to these conditions coupled with overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry we have sought to modify terms and conditions exit unprofitable business and develop advanced data analytics to improve profitability we have observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges commencing in the second quarter of 2011 we have benefitted from favorable pricing trends particularly in our u s commercial business the property casualty insurance industry is experiencing modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in some markets we also expect that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions strategic initiatives and opportunities business mix shift as part of our strategy to expand our consumer operations in growth economies on may 29 2013 we entered into a joint venture agreement with picc life insurance company limited picc life a subsidiary of the people insurance company group of china limited picc group to form an

p and c a subsidiary of the picc group for a purchase price of approximately 93 million immediately prior to and after the rights offering we owned 9 9 percent of the outstanding shares in picc p and c 82 item 2 executive overview capital efficiency we continue to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad based risk tolerance guidelines for our operating units implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends in addition we remain focused on enhancing our global reinsurance strategy to improve capital efficiency we continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency in the nine months ended september 30 2013 we completed 29 legal entity and branch restructuring transactions we continue to implement restructuring plans in various jurisdictions our overall legal entity restructuring is expected to be mostly completed by the end of 2014 subject to regulatory approvals in those jurisdictions on july 16 2013 we announced the planned merger of aiu insurance company ltd and fuji scheduled to take place in the second half of 2015 or later subject to regulatory approvals the merger is consistent with our growth strategy for the japan market and is intended to combine the expertise and experience of these companies to meet our customers and partners needs and provide products and services that will target higher levels of customer satisfaction in a cost effective manner we continued our strategy to improve the allocation of our reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets on july 9 2013 we entered into a five year catastrophe bond transaction which will provide 125 million of indemnity protection against u s caribbean and gulf of mexico named storms and u s and canadian earthquakes the transaction provides us with fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on a per occurrence basis through june 2018 in addition effective may 31 2013 we modified certain internal reinsurance arrangements from our japan entities to simplify operations and facilitate efficient capital allocation on september 1 2013 we transferred the ownership of aig europe holdings limited from aig overseas association and aig overseas limited to aig property casualty international llc this transaction is expected to enhance capital efficiency and increase dividend capacity in the future aig

earnings and increase capital efficiency within our life insurance entities investment strategy maintain a diversified high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities and match the duration characteristics of liabilities with assets of comparable duration and pursue yield enhancement opportunities that meet our liquidity risk and return objectives market conditions and industry trends market conditions strong equity market performance and low volatility coupled with positive demographic trends have provided a favorable environment for sales of individual variable annuities and contributed to growth in separate account assets under management in both our retirement income solutions and group retirement product lines which has resulted in higher fee income equity market volatility and changes in interest rates affect the level of reserves for variable 83 item 2 executive overview annuity guaranteed benefit features and may affect the recoverability and amortization rate of dac assets for such products innovative product design and our comprehensive dynamic hedging program are critical tools for managing volatility for products where we have equity market exposure the low interest rate environment relative to historical levels continues to affect our business as well as the life and annuity industry overall continued low interest rates put pressure on long term investment returns negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products such as fixed annuities and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products products such as payout annuities and traditional life insurance that are not rate adjustable may require increases in reserves if future investment yields fall to a level that results in expected future losses in addition low interest rates can affect future investment margins and may also affect the recoverability and amortization rate of dac assets in our variable annuity fixed annuity and universal life businesses we will continue to address the impact of low interest rates we actively manage renewal crediting rates and have a disciplined approach to pricing new sales of interest rate sensitive products including reduced minimum rate guarantees also as market conditions change we manage our asset and liability interest rate exposures and strategic asset allocation to emphasize lower or higher durations in the portfolio overall the recent modest increase in interest rates has improved our outlook for sales and profitability rapid and significant increases from current market interest rates however could result in elevated surrender activity in interest sensitive products primarily fixed annuities with lower guaranteed minimum interest rates the extent of elevated surrender activity if any will depend on the level of minimum guarantees in existing contracts relative to the pace and extent of market interest rate increases industry trends consumer demand for guaranteed income features and changes in the competitive landscape for individual variable annuities have provided a positive environment for sales of our retirement income solutions products assuming no significant changes in market conditions strong sales of these products are expected to continue as consumers seek to address their need for financial and retirement security industry fixed annuity sales which have been challenged by the sustained historically low interest rate environment have benefited recently from the modest increase in interest rates sales and net flows in our fixed annuities product line are improving as increasing market interest rates and steepening of the yield curve make fixed annuity products more attractive compared to alternatives such as bank deposits the life insurance marketplace continues to be highly competitive we are continuing to execute our strategy of leveraging our scale utilizing our expertise in pricing and risk selection and creating differentiated products utilizing our consumer focused research this has resulted in a series of new product offerings and new term life rates which we expect will drive additional sales utilizing the aig life and retirement unified distribution organization as well as new distribution opportunities we intend to expand our distribution footprint for life products other operations strategic initiatives and outlook mortgage guaranty ugc executive overview risk selection ensure the high quality of our business through a continuous focus on risk selection and a risk based pricing using a

in the mortgage system ease of use reduce complexity in the mortgage insurance system expense management streamline our processes through the use of technology and shared services 84 item 2 executive overview market conditions and industry trends during the first half of 2013 the u s mortgage market showed increasing levels of mortgage originations home value appreciation and elevated mortgage underwriting standards these factors combined with improving u s macroeconomic conditions and low interest rates favorably impacted mortgage loan volumes the quality of new business written and our overall operating results during the nine month period ended september 30 2013 however recent increases in interest rates are expected to reduce new mortgage loan volumes for the remainder of 2013 and into 2014 due to reduced refinancing activity which we expect to be partially offset by strength in mortgage lending for home purchases while increasing interest rates generally have an unfavorable impact on new mortgage loan volumes ugc expects that increasing interest rates will have a favorable impact on the persistency of business written over the last several quarters since refinancing of loans would be unattractive to homeowners who originated mortgages at the historically low interest rates prevalent during those periods in addition ugc expects cure rates to improve as a result of home value appreciation since such appreciation will encourage homeowners with delinquent mortgages to sell and purchase another home or to refinance their existing mortgages we believe the combination of higher persistency and improving cure rates partially offset by changes in new mortgage loan volumes will continue to strengthen ugc operating results throughout 2014 strategic initiatives and opportunities risk selection for the remainder of 2013 and during 2014 ugc expects to continue as a leading provider of mortgage insurance and will differentiate itself from its competitors by utilizing a risk based pricing strategy this pricing strategy provides ugc customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with underwriting risk which we believe will result in an appropriately priced high quality book of business ugc plans to continue to execute this strategy through 2014 the new business generated under this strategy since 2009 accounts for approximately 51 percent of net premiums earned for the nine months ended september 30 2013 global capital markets aig markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between aig and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for aig entities the derivative portfolio of aig markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives the remaining derivatives portfolio of aig financial products corp and aig trading group inc and their respective subsidiaries collectively aigfp consists primarily of hedges of the assets and liabilities of the dib and a portion of the legacy hedges for aig and its subsidiaries aigfp derivatives portfolio consists primarily of interest rate currency credit commodity and equity derivatives additionally aigfp has a credit default swap portfolio being managed for economic benefit and with limited risk the aigfp portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with our risk management objectives although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility it consists predominantly of transactions that we believe are of low complexity low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis direct investment book the dib consists of a portfolio of assets and liabilities held directly by aig parent in the mip and certain non derivative assets and liabilities of aigfp the dib portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due even under stress scenarios and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives we are focused on meeting the dib liquidity needs including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the dib without relying on resources beyond the dib as part of this program management we may from time to time access the capital markets including issuing and repurchasing debt and selling assets on an opportunistic basis in each case subject to market conditions 85 item 2 executive overview from time to time we may utilize cash allocated to the dib that is not required to meet the risk target for dib for general corporate purposes unrelated to the dib the dib assets consist primarily of cash short term investments fixed maturity securities issued by corporations u s government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset backed securities the value of these assets is impacted by macro economic trends in u s and core european markets including corporate credit spreads commercial and residential real estate markets and to a lesser extent interest rates and foreign exchange rates among other factors the majority of these assets are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through earnings the dib has both liabilities that are held at cost and liabilities that are held at fair value the liabilities held at fair value vary in price based on changes in aig credit spreads with changes in fair value reflected in earnings changes in the fundamental drivers of the fair value of dib assets and liabilities will create earnings volatility for the dib on a period to period comparative basis the overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the dib is executed by gcm the value of hedges related to the non derivative assets and liabilities of aigfp in the dib is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of gcm and is not included within the dib operating results assets or liabilities 86 table of contents item 2 results of operations results of operations the following section provides a

periods ended september 30 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 net investment income decreased in the three month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 due to

performance of alternative investments and income associated with the picc p and c shares aig life and retirement pre tax income increased in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 primarily due to increased fee income from growth in our variable annuity account value and continued active spread management related to our interest rate sensitive businesses the 2013 periods included a 118 million net increase in pre tax operating income from adjustments to update certain estimated gross profit assumptions used to amortize dac and related items in our interest sensitive product lines the nine month period ended september 30 2013 also included income from legal settlements these increases were partially offset by the absence of

increased in the nine month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same periods in 2012 primarily due to gains on different volumes of sales activity in connection with our program to utilize capital loss carryforwards which were partially offset by the triggering of additional loss recognition reserves reflected in policyholder benefits and claims incurred from the subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds from these sales at lower yields other operations other operations reported a pre tax loss in the three month period ended september 30 2013 compared to pre tax income in the same

business aig property casualty quarterly and year to date 2013 highlights net premiums written decreased by one percent for both the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the effect of foreign exchange as a result of the strengthening of the u s dollar against the japanese yen and an increase in specific casualty reinsurance arrangements to better manage our exposures this decrease was partially offset by the growth of new business and rate increases also in the first quarter of 2013 we began to recognize ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contract rather than ratably over the contract period the negative impact on net premiums written from this change in the first quarter of 2013 began to reverse in the second quarter of 2013 and will continue to reverse throughout the rest of 2013 for the three month period ended september 30 2013 the impact of the

written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contract rather than ratably over the contract period previously we recognized ceded premiums written on these agreements based on the quarterly contractual remittance requirements and recorded an adjustment at the end of the contract term to reflect the actual ceded premiums written amounts this change resulted in the acceleration of ceded premiums written to earlier quarters but had only a de minimis effect on net premiums earned as a result of this change ceded premiums written for the three month period ended

bond issuance occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 specialty net premiums written increased in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 compared to the same periods in the prior year

three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to higher losses associated with a warranty retail program which increased the loss ratio by 1 0 point and 0 8 points respectively this was partially offset by improvements in automobile and personal property as a result of rate and underwriting actions taken in current and prior years storm sandy favorable development reduced the loss ratio by 0 5 points in the nine month period ended september 30 2013 the acquisition ratio increased by 0 4 points and 1 3

targeted lines of business the general operating expense ratio increased by 0 2 points and 0 4 points in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year the general operating expense ratio increased primarily due to the increase in employee incentive compensation expense previously discussed for both periods for the nine month period ended september 30 2013 the increase in employee incentive compensation expense was partially offset by lower infrastructure project costs other category we incurred higher general operating expenses in the three month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to personnel costs partially offset by the reduced costs for infrastructure projects that are not specific to either commercial insurance or consumer insurance this contributed approximately 0 3 points to the decrease to the aig property casualty general operating expense ratio in the three month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year we continue to invest in a number of infrastructure projects including the implementation of global finance and information systems compliance with the regulatory requirements of the frb legal entity restructuring and underwriting and claims improvement initiatives we incurred higher general operating expenses in the nine month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily related to our implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in japan

insurance operating segments as well as the other category invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately identified for the commercial insurance and consumer insurance operating segments investment income is allocated to the commercial insurance and consumer insurance operating segments based on an internal investment income allocation model the model estimates investable funds based primarily on loss reserves unearned premiums and a capital allocation for each segment the investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk free yields plus an illiquidity premium consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities the actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributable to

income net investment income decreased by 48 million or 4 percent in the three month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to the lower returns on alternative investments and mutual funds net investment income increased by 244 million or 7 percent in the nine month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to the strong performance in alternative investments corporate debt securities continues to be our largest asset category we continued to reduce our concentration in lower yielding tax exempt municipal bond holdings and focus on risk weighted opportunistic investments in higher yielding assets such as structured securities this asset diversification has achieved similar average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity investments were largely unchanged we expect to continue to execute our investment strategy in 2013 to meet our liquidity duration and credit

net losses and loss expenses as of september 30 2013 while we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed our loss reserves as of september 30 2013 in our opinion such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the following table presents

claims and claims adjustment expense quarterly and year to date net loss development by accident year for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 the favorable development in accident year 2010 was primarily the result of favorable claims emergence from domestic excess casualty and from liability coverage policies that are on a claims made basis also for the same periods the adverse development from accident years 2003 and prior were primarily driven by loss development on toxic tort and construction general liability claims for the nine month period ended september 30 2012 the favorable development in accident year 2011 was driven primarily by the favorable development on natural catastrophes primarily the japan earthquake and the adverse development in accident years 2003 and prior was primarily the result of the increase in reserves on environmental business policies written after 1987 for certain categories of claims e g construction defect claims and environmental claims and for reinsurance recoverables losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to

for prior years net of reinsurance by major class of business data table removed 115 table of contents item 2 results of operations liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense quarterly and year to date net loss development in determining the loss development from prior accident years we analyze and evaluate the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable as appropriate we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence as part of our reserving process we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 the net adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in the commercial insurance operating segment that were partially offset by net favorable development in the consumer insurance operating segment the net adverse development in commercial insurance was primarily attributable to the increase in reserves on domestic primary casualty mostly due to the increase in reserves in construction general liability lines and by adverse development in the domestic environmental business policies written after 1987 including adverse development on toxic tort claims in that line of business and the domestic excess casualty business the adverse development on those classes was partially offset by favorable other claims emergence in the domestic excess casualty line of business in addition the nine month period ended september 30 2013 included adverse development in commercial insurance attributable to catastrophe related domestic property exposures primarily due to the increase in reserves for storm sandy the favorable development in consumer insurance was due to lower than expected losses in personal lines including decreases in reserves for storm sandy and non catastrophe losses for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2012 the net adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in commercial insurance and other which was partially offset by net favorable development in reserves in consumer insurance the net adverse development in commercial insurance was primarily attributable to the increase in reserves on primary casualty and domestic environmental business policies written after 1987 partially offset by favorable development in domestic property exposures and catastrophe losses the favorable development in consumer insurance was due to lower than expected losses on natural catastrophe losses in personal lines aig property casualty recognized additional premiums on loss sensitive business of 3 million and 83 million for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 respectively compared to returned premiums

securities considered investment grade while naic designations of 3 through 6 generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities including non agency rmbs and cmbs which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the

september 30 2013 decreased slightly compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to fair value gains of 246 million recognized in the same period of 2012 on our investment in ml ii

september 30 2013 decreased by 130 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to reinvestment of maturing investments and asset sale proceeds in the low interest rate environment the decrease in net investment income for the nine month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year also reflected net fair value losses of 38 million from our investment in picc group and a 41 million decrease in accretion of discount for certain highly rated structured securities which was driven by recent increases in market interest rates these decreases were largely offset by a 440 million increase in alternative investment income including higher private equity and hedge fund income due to favorable equity market conditions and several large redemptions from hedge funds and an increase in call and tender income of 35 million in the nine month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year spread management the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in our products may have the effect in a continued low interest rate environment of reducing our spreads and thus reducing future profitability although we partially mitigate this interest rate risk through our asset liability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability disciplined pricing on new business resulted in lower new fixed annuity deposits in the first six months of 2013 relative to the same period in the prior year due to the relatively low crediting rates offered however deposits improved in the three month period ended september 30 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year due to the recent modest increase in market interest rates in the current interest rate environment we continue to pursue new sales of life and annuity products at targeted

periods ended september 30 2013 which included a 198 million net increase in our retail operating segment and an 80 million decrease in our institutional operating segment the net increase in retail pre tax operating income was primarily due to a favorable adjustment in our fixed annuities product line from updated spread assumptions due to active management of crediting rates and higher future investment yields than those previously assumed in the life insurance and a and h retirement income solutions and group retirement product lines the update of 130 item 2 results of operations aig life

less than 2 percent of the dac voba balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation appreciation of investments as of september 30 2013 the effect of short term fluctuations in the equity markets on the estimated gross profits of products with guaranteed benefit features is mitigated in part through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology which allows us to maintain our long term assumptions while also giving consideration to the effect of short term deviations from these assumptions occurring in the current period if favorable equity market performance continues for

shares of aig common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 192 million in the third quarter of 2013 144 item 2 liquidity and capital resources aig property casualty we expect that aig property casualty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events through cash from operations and to the extent necessary monetization of invested assets aig property casualty subsidiaries liquidity resources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities aig property casualty paid cash dividends to aig parent of 716 million and 1 5 billion in the three and nine month period ended september 30 2013 respectively aig parent could be required to provide additional funding to aig property casualty subsidiaries to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances including large catastrophes that may require aig to provide additional support to our affected operations downgrades in aig credit ratings that could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of aig subsidiaries which could result in non renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary ability to meet its own obligations increases in market interest rates that may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital and other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain including economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations nationalization catastrophic terrorist acts pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval aig parent aig property casualty inc and certain aig property casualty domestic insurance subsidiaries are parties to a consolidated cma among other things the cma provides that aig parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of these aig property casualty insurance subsidiaries measured as a group the fleet at or above the specified minimum percentage of the fleet projected total authorized control level risk based capital rbc in addition the cma provides that if the total adjusted capital of the fleet exceeds that same specified minimum percentage of the fleet total authorized control level rbc subject to approval by their respective boards and compliance with applicable insurance laws the aig property casualty insurance subsidiaries would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce the fleet projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage as of september 30 2013 the specified minimum percentage was 325 percent for the first nine months of 2013 cash dividends of approximately 1 0 billion were paid pursuant to the cma and aig parent was not required to make any capital contributions pursuant to the cma on may 17 2013 lexington insurance company lexington purchased stock in the federal home loan bank fhlb of boston thereby becoming a member of the fhlb of boston additionally national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh pa nufi is a member of the fhlb of pittsburgh and chartis specialty insurance company csi is a member of the fhlb of chicago fhlb membership provides participants with access to various services including access to low cost advances through pledging of certain mortgage backed securities government and agency securities and other qualifying assets these advances may be used to provide an additional source of liquidity for balance sheet management or contingency funding purposes as of september 30 2013 there were no fhlb advances outstanding for nufi csi or lexington on april 29 2013 we entered into a new 625 million ascot corporate name limited acnl letter of credit facility which replaced the prior 725 million acnl letter of credit facility under the new facility aig parent replaced aig property casualty inc as a direct obligor acnl as a member of the lloyd of london insurance syndicate lloyd is required to hold capital at lloyd known as funds at lloyds fal under the new facility which supports the 2013 2014 and 2015 years of account the entire fal requirement of 564 million as of april 29 2013 was satisfied with a letter of credit issued under the facility 145 item 2 liquidity and capital resources aig life and retirement we expect that aig life and retirement subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events through cash from operations and to the extent necessary monetization of invested assets aig life and retirement subsidiaries liquidity resources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities in the first nine months of 2013 aig life and retirement provided 3 1 billion of liquidity to aig parent which was funded by the payment of dividends and loan repayments from aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries the need to fund product surrenders withdrawals and maturities creates a significant potential liquidity requirement for aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries we believe that because of the size and liquidity of our investment portfolios aig life and retirement does not face a significant liquidity risk due to normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience furthermore aig life and retirement products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk including surrender charges as part of its risk management framework aig life and retirement continues to evaluate and where appropriate pursue strategies and programs to improve its liquidity position and facilitate aig life and retirement ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio aig life and retirement also has developed a robust contingent liquidity plan to address any unforeseen liquidity needs aig life and retirement executes programs which began in 2012 that lend securities from its investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management under these programs aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries lend securities to financial institutions and receive collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities reinvestment of cash collateral received is restricted to liquid investments additionally the aggregate amount of securities that an aig life and retirement insurance company may lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account admitted assets aig life and retirement liability to the borrower for collateral received was 4 1 billion as of september 30 2013 in addition certain aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries are members of the fhlbs in their respective districts as of september 30 2013 aig life and retirement had outstanding borrowings of 50 million from the fhlbs borrowings from the fhlbs are used to supplement liquidity or for other general corporate purposes aig parent is party to cmas with certain aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries among other things the cmas provide that aig parent will maintain the total adjusted capital of each of these aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries at or above a specified minimum percentage of the subsidiary projected company action level rbc in addition the cmas provide that if the total adjusted capital of these aig life and retirement insurance subsidiaries is in excess of that same specified minimum percentage of their respective total company action level rbc subject to approval by their respective boards and compliance with applicable insurance laws the subsidiaries would declare and pay ordinary dividends to their respective equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual total adjusted capital to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum percentage as of september 30 2013 the specified minimum percentage was 385 percent except for the cma with agc life insurance company where the specified minimum percentage is 250 percent for the nine month period ended september 30 2013 approximately 3 1 billion was distributed under the cmas and aig parent was not required to make any capital contributions under the cmas other operations mortgage guaranty we expect that mortgage guaranty subsidiaries will be able to continue to satisfy future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events through cash from operations and to the extent necessary monetization of invested assets mortgage guaranty liquidity resources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities these securities could be monetized in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations mortgage guaranty paid no dividends to aig parent in the first nine months of 2013 146 item 2 liquidity and capital resources on july 1 2013 aig parent entered into a cma with a mortgage guaranty insurance subsidiary among other things the cma provides that aig parent will maintain capital and surplus of this mortgage guaranty insurance subsidiary at or above a specified minimum required capital based on a specified risk to capital ratio in addition the cma provides that if capital and surplus of this mortgage guaranty insurance subsidiary is in excess of that same specified minimum required capital subject to board approval and compliance with applicable insurance laws this mortgage guaranty insurance subsidiary would declare and pay ordinary dividends to its equity holders up to an amount necessary to reduce projected or actual capital and surplus to a level equal to or not materially greater than such specified minimum required capital as structured the cma contemplates that the specified minimum required capital would be reviewed and agreed upon at least annually as of september 30 2013 the minimum required capital is based on a risk to capital ratio of 21 to 1 for the third quarter of 2013 no dividends were paid pursuant to the cma and aig parent was not required to make any capital contributions under the cma global capital markets derivative transactions between aig and its subsidiaries and third parties are generally centralized through gcm one of gcm entities generally acts as the derivatives intermediary between aig and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for aig entities commencing june 10 2013 gcm was required to clear certain derivatives transactions through central regulated clearing organizations pursuant to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank to the extent a derivatives transaction is subject to a clearing obligation gcm is required to post collateral in amounts determined by the relevant clearing organization and gcm clearing agreements with its futures commission merchants to the extent a derivatives transaction is not subject to a clearing obligation these derivative transactions are governed by bilateral master agreements the form of which is published by the international swaps and derivatives association inc isda these agreements primarily between gcm and third party financial institutions require collateral postings many of gcm transactions with aig and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements the purpose of which are to provide collateral to gcm which in turn is used to satisfy posting requirements with third parties including the margin requirements of clearing organizations and futures commission merchants in addition most of gcm cdss are subject to collateral posting provisions the collateral posting provisions contained in the isda master agreements and related transaction documents with respect to cdss differ among counterparties and asset classes the amount of future collateral posting requirements for super senior cdss is a function of our credit ratings the rating of the relevant reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor we estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior cdss using various methodologies the contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions as of september 30 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively gcm had total assets of 8 0 billion in both periods and total liabilities of 3 4 billion and 4 9 billion gcm assets consist primarily of cash short term investments other receivables net of allowance and unrealized gains on swaps options and forwards gcm liabilities consist primarily of trade payables and unrealized losses on swaps options and forwards collateral posted by gcm to third parties was 3 3 billion and 4 2 billion at september 30 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively gcm obtained collateral from third parties totaling 604 million and 846 million at september 30 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively the collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under isda master agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date direct investment book the dib portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due even under stress scenarios and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives if the dib risk target is breached we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the dib liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then prevailing market conditions any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by aig parent 147 item 2 liquidity and capital resources the dib assets consist primarily of cash short term investments fixed maturity securities issued by corporations u s government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset backed securities the dib liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short term financing obligations as of september 30 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively the dib had total assets of 23 7 billion and 28 5 billion and total liabilities of 20 8 billion and 23 8 billion the overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the dib is executed by gcm the value of hedges related to the non derivative assets and liabilities of aigfp in the dib is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of gcm and is not included within the dib operating results assets or liabilities collateral posted by operations included in the dib to third parties was 4 3 billion at both september 30 2013 and december 31 2012 this collateral primarily consists of securities of the u s government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties credit facilities we maintain a committed revolving four year syndicated credit facility the four year facility as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes the four year facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit we currently expect to replace or extend the four year facility on or prior to its expiration in october 2016 although no assurance can be given that the four year facility will be replaced on favorable terms or at all the four year facility provides for 4 0 billion of unsecured revolving loans which includes a 2 0 billion letter of credit sublimit as of september 30 2013 a total of approximately 3 6 billion remains available under the four year facility of which approximately 1 6 billion remains available for letters of credit during the third quarter of 2013 we reduced our utilization of letters of credit under the four year facility our ability to borrow under the four year facility is not contingent on our credit ratings however our ability to borrow under the four year facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal operating administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the four year facility these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the four year facility would restrict our access to the four year facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity we expect to borrow under the four year facility from time to time and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes contingent liquidity facilities aig parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to 500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes under this facility we have the unconditional right prior to december 15 2015 to issue up to 500 million in senior debt to the counterparty based on a put option agreement between aig parent and the counterparty our ability to borrow under this facility is not contingent on our credit ratings 148 item 2 liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations the following table summarizes contractual obligations in total and by remaining maturity data table removed a includes 22 3 billion of borrowings related to ilfc which is reported as discontinued operations b primarily includes contracts to purchase future services and other capital expenditures c does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of 4 6 billion 4 3 billion excluding ilfc the timing of which is uncertain loss reserves loss reserves relate to the aig property casualty and the mortgage guaranty businesses and represent future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns due to the significance of the assumptions used the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments we believe that aig property casualty and mortgage guaranty subsidiaries maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations 149 table of contents item 2 liquidity and capital resources insurance and investment contract liabilities insurance and investment contract liabilities including gic liabilities relate to aig life and retirement businesses these liabilities include various investment type products with contractually scheduled maturities including periodic payments of a term certain nature these liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations for these policies and contracts i we are currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event such as death or disability ii payments are conditional on survivorship or iii payment may occur due to a surrender or other non scheduled event out of our control we have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits these assumptions include mortality morbidity future lapse rates expenses investment returns and interest crediting rates offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in force policies due to the significance of the assumptions the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments the amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets we believe that aig life and retirement subsidiaries have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations these subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments in addition aig life and retirement businesses maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient we expect liquidity needs related to gic liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets borrowings our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value we expect to repay the long term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by aig through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets future cash flows from operations cash flows generated from invested assets future debt issuance and other financing arrangements 150 item 2 liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements and commercial commitments the following table summarizes off balance sheet arrangements and commercial commitments in total and by remaining maturity data

for indemnification obligations included in asset sales agreements see note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on indemnification obligations b includes commitments to invest in private equity funds hedge funds and mutual funds and commitments to purchase and develop real estate in the united states and abroad the commitments to invest in private equity funds hedge funds and other funds are called at the discretion of each fund as needed for funding new investments or expenses of the fund the expiration of these commitments is estimated in the table above based on the expected life cycle of the related fund consistent with past trends of requirements for funding investors under these commitments are primarily insurance and real estate subsidiaries c does not include guarantees capital maintenance agreements or other support arrangements among aig consolidated entities d primarily represents liquidity facilities provided in connection with certain municipal swap transactions and collateralized bond obligations e excludes commitments with respect to pension plans the remaining pension contribution for 2013 is expected to be approximately 18 million for u s and non u s plans f includes 335 million attributable to ilfc which is reported as discontinued operations 151 item 2 liquidity and capital resources arrangements with variable interest entities although we enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities vies in the normal course of business our involvement with vies is primarily as a passive investor in fixed maturity securities rated and unrated and equity interests issued by vies we consolidate a vie when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity for a further discussion of our

limitation depending on the specific terms of the arrangements the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations for additional information regarding our indemnification agreements see note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements we have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them these

investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit the investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for aig property casualty aig life and retirement and aig parent including the dib the primary objectives are generation of investment income preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities investments highlights during the nine months ended september 30 2013 an increase in interest rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities particularly during the second quarter of 2013 partially offset by narrowing spreads of high yield securities resulted in net unrealized losses in the investment portfolio net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio declined to approximately 13 billion as of september 30 2013 from approximately 25 billion as of december 31 2012 we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income net investment income benefited from higher returns on alternative investments primarily due to the performance of equity markets blended investment yields on new aig life and retirement and aig property casualty investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called other than temporary impairments remained at low levels with a small portion of impairments attributable to structured securities investment strategies at the local operating unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market general market conditions liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification in the case of aig life and retirement as well as in the dib our fundamental investment strategy is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration to the extent practicable fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in aig property casualty historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk to meet the current risk return and tax objectives of aig property casualty cash flows from the investment portfolio and insurance operations are generally being reinvested by the domestic property and casualty companies in taxable instruments which meet the companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by aig property casualty companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate aig parent liquidity resources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded intermediate term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities aig parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and tenor during the first nine months of 2013 upon an assessment of its immediate and longer term funding needs aig parent purchased publicly traded intermediate term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity 156 item 2 investments credit ratings at september 30 2013 approximately 89 percent of fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities approximately 18 percent of such securities were rated aaa by one or more of the principal rating agencies and approximately 16 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings third party rating services ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis a significant portion of our foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by moody s and p or similar foreign rating services rating services are not available for some foreign issued securities our credit risk management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio non rated fixed maturity securities at september 30 2013 approximately 17 percent of such investments were either rated aaa or on

tail casualty lines is greater than that for other lines as differentiated from the life insurance and retirement services companies the focus is not on asset liability matching but on preservation of capital and growth of surplus fixed maturity securities of aig property casualty domestic operations with an average duration of 4 1 years are currently comprised primarily of tax exempt securities which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds government and agency bonds and corporate bonds the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings 159 table of contents item 2 investments fixed maturity securities held in aig property casualty foreign operations are of high quality and short to intermediate duration averaging 4 1 years while invested assets backing reserves are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities in aig property casualty domestic operations a modest portion of surplus is allocated to alternative investments including private equity and hedge funds these investments have provided a combination of added diversification and attractive long term returns over time aig life and retirement with respect to aig life and retirement we use asset liability management as a tool to determine the composition of the invested assets our objective is to maintain an average duration in our asset and liability structure although we may occasionally determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position to the extent that we have maintained a matched asset liability structure the economic effect of interest rate fluctuations is partially mitigated our investment strategy for aig life and retirement is to produce cash flows greater than maturing insurance liabilities there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities aig life and retirement frequently reviews its interest rate assumptions and actively manages the crediting rates used for its new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a low interest rate environment the investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds from investment activity requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity a number of guaranteed benefits such as living benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits are offered on certain variable and indexed annuity products the fair value of these benefits is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts we manage our exposure resulting from these long term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments we actively review underlying assumptions of policyholder behavior and persistency related to these guarantees we have taken positions in certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the impact of changes in equity markets and interest rates on these benefit guarantees we execute listed futures and options contracts on equity indexes to hedge certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuity products we also enter into various types of futures and options contracts primarily to hedge changes in value of certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuities due to fluctuations in interest rates we use several instruments to hedge interest rate exposure including listed futures on government securities listed options on government securities and the purchase of government securities with respect to over the counter derivatives we deal with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts we have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically we generally use isda master agreements and credit support annexes csas with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures fixed maturity securities of aig life and retirement with an average duration of 6 7 years are comprised of taxable corporate bonds as well as municipal and government bonds and agency and

realization because certain realized losses will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain dac e item count is by cusip by subsidiary change in unrealized appreciation of investments the increases in unrealized depreciation of investments in the first nine months of 2013 were primarily attributable to depreciation in bonds available for sale due to an increase in interest rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities particularly during the second quarter of 2013 partially offset by narrowing spreads of higher yielding securities the increases in unrealized appreciation of investments in the first nine months of 2012 were primarily attributable to appreciation in bonds available for sale due to continued improvements in financial market conditions and significant spread tightening partially offset by higher u s treasury rates for the nine month period ended september 30 2013 net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by 12 8 billion primarily due to the increase in interest rates for investment grade fixed maturity securities which more than offset the narrowing of credit spreads for higher yielding securities and the realization of approximately 2 1 billion in gains from sales of securities see also note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment portfolio 171

european credit exposures especially those exposures to issuers in the euro zone periphery we use various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine the need for mitigating actions as a mitigating action we typically decide not to renew maturing exposures or when the opportunity presents itself to sell or to tender securities to date we have not actively used credit default protection we periodically evaluate the financial condition of issuers and adjust internal risk ratings as warranted the result of these continuing reviews has led us to believe that our combined credit risk exposures in the euro zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers 174 item

spreads we periodically adjust limits and review exposures for risk mitigation to provide reasonable assurance that we do not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that our credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units market risk management market risk is defined as the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in interest rates credit spreads equity and commodity prices foreign currencies and their levels of volatility we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance businesses and gcm in our insurance operations market risk results primarily from potential mismatches in our asset liability exposures rather than speculative positioning specifically our life insurance and retirement businesses collect premiums or deposits from policyholders and invest the proceeds in predominantly long term fixed maturity securities we earn a spread between the asset yield and the cost payable to policyholders we manage the business so that the cash flows from invested assets are sufficient to meet policyholder obligations when they become due without the need to sell assets prematurely into a potentially distressed market in periods of severe market volatility depressed and illiquid fair values on otherwise performing investments diminish shareholders equity even without actual credit event related losses 177 item 2 enterprise risk management our market exposures can be categorized as follows benchmark interest rates benchmark interest rates are associated with either the government treasury yield curve or the swap curve the fair value of our significant fixed maturity securities portfolio changes as benchmark interest rates change credit spread or risk premium credit spread risk is the potential for loss due to a change in an instrument risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration default free instrument equity and alternative investment prices we are exposed to equity and alternative investment prices affecting a variety of instruments these include direct investments in common stock and mutual funds minimum benefit guarantees embedded in the structure of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance products and other equity like investments such as hedge funds and private equity funds private equity investments commercial real estate and real estate funds foreign currency exchange rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income assets and liabilities denominated in and significant capital deployed in a variety of currencies we use a number of measures and approaches to measure and quantify our market risk exposure including duration key rate duration duration is the measure of the sensitivities of a fixed income instrument to the changes in the benchmark yield curve key rate duration measures sensitivities to the movement at a given term point on the yield curve scenario analysis scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forward looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 10 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world wide equity markets stress testing stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of rmbs or cmbs during 2008 var value at risk var is a summary statistical measure that uses the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors and a management determined level of confidence to estimate how frequently a portfolio of risk exposures could be expected to lose at least a specified amount as an example federal reserve market risk measure specifies a var based approach to calculate market risk equivalent assets for capital ratio calculations insurance operations portfolio sensitivities the following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed exposures to yield curve movements include fixed maturity securities loans finance receivables and short term investments but exclude consolidated separate account assets total yield sensitive assets decreased 4 8 percent or approximately 14 6 billion compared to december 31 2012 primarily due to a net decrease in fixed income securities and other fixed assets of 12 2 billion and a decrease in cash equivalents of 2 4 billion exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stock preferred stocks mutual funds hedge funds private equity funds commercial real estate and real estate funds but exclude consolidated 178 item 2 enterprise risk management separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds total exposure in these areas increased 1 4 percent or approximately 380 million compared to december 31 2012 primarily due to an increase of 310 million related to alternative investments and an increase in common equity securities of 311 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other equity investments of 126 million a decrease in real estate investments of 70 million and decrease in mutual fund value of 45 million exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect our consolidated non u s dollar net capital investments on a gaap basis foreign currency exchange rates net exposure increased 1 0 percent or 94 million compared to december 31 2012 this was primarily due to an increase in hong kong dollar exposure of 592 million resulting from aig life and retirement investment in picc group an increase in japanese yen exposure of 499 million resulting from aig property casualty japan operations and unrealized appreciation of investments and an increase in israeli shekel exposure of 101 million resulting from the increase in our ownership of aig israel insurance company limited to 100 percent from 50 percent the increase was partially offset by a decrease in canadian dollar exposure of 232 million from the operations of aig insurance company of canada a decrease in euro exposure of 202 million resulting from the operations of aig europe limited france branch a decrease in euro exposure of 149 resulting from ai overseas associations aioa ibnr reserves adjustments and decreases in the british pound and australian dollar exposures of 137 million and 102 million respectively resulting from the weakening of these currencies against the u s dollar for illustrative purposes we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u s dollar this should not be taken as a prediction but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short term cash collateral or other financial obligations the failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in reduced operating flexibility increased costs and reputational harm because liquidity is critically important our liquidity governance includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address both aig specific broader industry and market related liquidity events sources of liquidity risk can include but are not limited to financial market movements significant changes in interest rates can provide incentives for policyholders to surrender their policies changes in markets can impact collateral posting requirements or limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs due to unfavorable market conditions inadequate market depth or other investors seeking to sell the same or similar assets potential reputational events or credit downgrade changes can have an impact on policyholder cancellations and withdrawals or impact collateral posting requirements and catastrophic events including natural and man made disasters that can increase policyholder claims the principal objective of erm liquidity risk framework is to protect aig liquidity position and identify a diversity of funding sources available to meet actual and contingent liabilities during both normal and stress periods we defined our risk appetite to include a liquidity target aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a two year time horizon designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions if we project that we will breach the tolerance we will assess and determine the appropriate liquidity management actions however the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements additionally each business unit is responsible for managing liquidity within a framework designed for the measurement and monitoring of liquidity risks inherent in that business current cash and liquidity positions are reviewed for changes and against minimum liquidity levels future cash inflows and outflows are tracked through cash flow forecasting if the business unit projects a breach of the minimum liquidity levels the amount of required liquidity resources will be identified and we will determine any actions to be taken business unit level key indicators are assessed to provide advance warning of potential liquidity risks 179 table of contents item 2 critical accounting estimates

criteria for held for sale and discontinued operations accounting at september 30 2013 and december 31 2012 recoverability of net deferred tax asset the evaluation of the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed we consider a number of factors in order to reliably estimate future taxable income so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses nols foreign tax credits ftcs and other capital loss carryforwards these factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and aig specific conditions and events we also subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization we also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies our income forecasts coupled with our tax planning strategies and stress scenarios all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the tax attributes other than life insurance business capital loss carryforwards prior to their expiration our ability to utilize aig life and retirement capital loss carryforwards depends in part on our ability to sell fixed maturity securities in a gain position changes in market conditions including interest rates rising in excess of our projections may result in a reduction in projected taxable

classified as level 3 data table removed level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable we consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment we classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation including contractual terms prices and rates yield curves credit curves measures of volatility prepayment rates default rates mortality rates and correlations of such inputs the following paragraphs describe the methods we use to measure fair value on a recurring basis for super senior credit default

financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future the financial stability board fsb consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the g20 nations has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies particularly global systemically important financial institutions should be regulated these frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision capital and solvency standards systemic economic risk corporate governance including compensation and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis the fsb has directed the international association of insurance supervisors the iais headquartered in basel switzerland to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body insurance core principles icps iais icps form the baseline threshold against which countries financial services regulatory efforts in the insurance sector are measured that measurement is made by periodic financial sector assessment program fsap reviews conducted by the world bank and the international monetary fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country specific additional or amended regulatory changes lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the financial services agency in japan financial and banking regulation adopted in france and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in germany and the united kingdom prudential regulation authority the fsb has also charged the iais with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups the iais has requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine which elements of the insurance sector if any could materially and adversely impact other parts of the global financial services sector e g commercial and investment banking securities trading etc the iais has provided its assessment template to the 184 item 2 regulatory environment fsb based on this assessment template on july 18 2013 the fsb in consultation with the iais and national authorities identified an initial list of g siis which includes aig as a g sii aig will be subject to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements enhanced group wide supervision and higher loss absorbency capital requirements it is expected that the g sii policy framework will be fully implemented by 2019 the iais is also developing a comframe a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups iaigs which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its icps but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of iaigs as currently delineated under the comframe aig meets the parameters set forth to define an iaig while we currently do not know when any comframe directives will be finalized and become effective the iais will undertake a field testing of the comframe including the possibility of additional capital requirements for iaigs which is expected to commence in the beginning of 2014 it is expected that implementation of the comframe would begin in 2019 legislation in the european union could also affect our international insurance operations the solvency ii directive 2009 138 eec solvency ii which was adopted on november 25 2009 and is expected to become effective in 2016 reforms the insurance industry solvency framework including minimum capital and solvency requirements governance requirements risk management and public reporting standards the impact on us will depend on whether the u s insurance regulatory regime is deemed equivalent to solvency ii if the u s insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent then we along with other insurance companies could be required to be supervised under solvency ii standards whether the u s insurance regulatory regime will be deemed equivalent is still under consideration by european authorities and remains uncertain so we are not currently able to predict the impact of solvency ii we expect that the regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future the national
