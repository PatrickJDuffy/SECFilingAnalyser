we are not under any obligation and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter any projections goals assumptions or other statements whether written or oral that may be made from time to time whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise data table removed use of non gaap measures throughout this md and a we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results some of the measurements we use are nongaap financial measures under securities and exchange commission rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the nongaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarlynamed measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income aoci book value per common share excluding aoci and deferred tax assets dta adjusted book value per common share and adjusted book value per common share including dividend growth are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci and dta adjusted shareholders equity by total common shares outstanding adjusted book value per common share including dividend growth is derived by dividing adjusted shareholders equity including growth in quarterly dividends above 0 125 per share to shareholders by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a return on equity after tax operating income excluding aoci and dta adjusted return on equity is used to show the rate of return on shareholders equity we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on equity adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized after tax operating income attributable to aig by average adjusted shareholders equity the reconciliation to return on equity the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a after tax operating income attributable to aig is derived by excluding the tax effected pre tax operating income ptoi adjustments described below and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges and uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance general operating expenses operating basis is derived by making the following adjustments to general operating and other expenses include i certain loss adjustment expenses reported as policyholder benefits and losses incurred and ii certain investment and other expenses reported as net investment income and exclude i advisory fee expenses ii non deferrable insurance commissions iii direct marketing and acquisition expenses net of deferrals iv non operating litigation reserves and v other expense related to an asbestos retroactive reinsurance agreement we use general operating expenses operating basis because we believe it provides a more meaningful indication of our ordinary course of business operating costs regardless of within which financial statement line item these expenses are reported externally within our segment results the majority of these expenses are employee related costs for example other acquisition expenses and losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily represent employee related costs in the underwriting and claims functions respectively excluded from this measure are non operating expenses such as restructuring costs and litigation reserves direct marketing expenses insurance company assessments and non deferrable commissions we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the results of operations section of this md and a operating revenues exclude net realized capital gains losses income from non operating litigation settlements included in other income for gaap purposes and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits included in net investment income for gaap purposes operating revenues is a gaap measure for our operating segments pre tax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from income from continuing operations before income tax this definition is consistent across our modules including geography these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions and measures that we believe to be common to the industry ptoi is a gaap measure for our operating segments data table removed commercial insurance liability and financial lines property and special risks consumer insurance personal insurance ratios we along with most property and casualty insurance companies use the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses which for commercial insurance excludes net loss reserve discount and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on aig in excess of 10 million each catastrophes also include certain man made events such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the 10 million threshold we believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of managements control we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results consumer insurance individual retirement group retirement and life insurance other operations institutional markets premiums and deposits includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies group benefit policies and lifecontingent payout annuities as well as deposits received on universal life investmenttype annuity contracts and mutual funds results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment data table removed these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected for a complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates you should read part ii item 7 md and a critical accounting estimates in the 2016 annual report executive summary overview this overview of the md and a highlights

primary focus is growth in intrinsic value we believe the following priorities for 2017 will help us to achieve our value creation goals data table removed aigs outlook industry and economic factors our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates currency exchange rates credit and equity market conditions catastrophic claims events regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continued to operate under difficult market conditions in the first quarter of 2017 characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates the department of labors the dol final fiduciary duty rule the dol fiduciary rule instability in the global equity markets volatile energy markets slowing growth in china and euro zone economies and the formal commencement of the united kingdoms the uk withdrawal from its membership in the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has also affected the u s dollar british pound exchange rate increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro british pound and the japanese yen the major currencies and created volatility in the financial markets which may continue for some time impact of changes in the interest rate environment interest rates decreased marginally in the first quarter of 2017 and have remained at historically low levels certain markets in which we operate have experienced negative interest rates a sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset liability management including spread management strategies for our investment oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities annuity sales and surrenders the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on investment returns which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products however our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads as long as the low interest rate environment continues conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales but may also drive higher surrenders customers are however currently buying fixed annuities with surrender periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment in addition older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio we will closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for guaranteed products with income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets including the level of interest rates credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment the low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity in addition there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain inforce business specifically the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the assetliability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability the following table presents fixed annuities and group retirement base net investment spread data table removed in fixed annuities and group retirement average interest crediting rates decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year due to disciplined pricing and active crediting rate management group retirements base net investment spread decreased in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of lower prepayment income received on commercial mortgage loans which more than offset the decrease in crediting rate see investments for additional information on our investment and asset liability management strategies for investment oriented products in our individual retirement group retirement life insurance and institutional markets businesses our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads using asset liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees we will continue to adjust crediting rates on in force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment contractual minimum crediting rates and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre established intervals for example competitors including private equity held annuity writers are currently offering higher crediting rates as a result the timing and extent of crediting rate decreases may differ from the corresponding declines in investment yields which could reduce our spreads and future profitability of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products 74 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at march 31 2017 the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 70 percent at both march 31 2017 and december 31 2016 these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the core universal life business in our life insurance business 72 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at march 31 2017 the following table presents fixed annuity and universal life account values of our core individual retirement group retirement and life insurance businesses by contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate and current crediting rates data table removed individual retirement and group retirement amounts shown include fixed options within variable annuity products commercial insurance the impact of low interest rates on our commercial insurance segment is primarily on our long tail casualty line of business we expect limited impacts on our existing long tail casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities we do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long tail casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates however we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection in addition for our commercial insurance segment and run off insurance lines reported within the legacy portfolio sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers compensation and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves additionally sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense department of labor fiduciary rule our individual retirement and group retirement operating segments provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to restrictions imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa and the internal revenue code including the requirements of the department of labors the dol final fiduciary duty rule the dol fiduciary rule related exemption amendments and subsequent interpretative guidance we are prepared to implement the necessary adjustments to achieve compliance with the dol fiduciary rule as it is phased in beginning june 9 2017 overall the dol fiduciary rule as currently promulgated would result in increased compliance costs and as currently promulgated may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances including class actions on april 4 2017 the dol announced a 60 day extension of the applicability dates of the dol fiduciary rule and related exemptions this announcement followed a february 3 2017 presidential memorandum that directed the dol to review the dol fiduciary rule and determine whether the dol fiduciary rule will adversely impact the ability of retirement savers to access retirement information and financial advice under the terms of the dols extension the new definition of fiduciary and the impartial conduct standards under the dol fiduciary rule will become effective beginning on june 9 2017 rather than on april 10 2017 as originally scheduled compliance with the remaining conditions and related exemptions is not required until january 1 2018 the dol also requested comments on the issues raised by the presidential memorandum and noted its intent to complete its review and decide whether to make or propose further changes to the rule or associated exemptions in the interim in the absence of further action by the dol full compliance with the dol fiduciary rule will be required by january 1 2018 we are closely following the dols ongoing review and assessment of this rule impact of currency volatility currency volatility remains acute as the british pound weakened considerably against the u s dollar and the japanese yen strengthened against the u s dollar the euro also weakened modestly against the u s dollar such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations in particular growth trends in net premiums written reported in u s dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies the net effect on underwriting results however is significantly mitigated as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected these currencies may continue to fluctuate in either direction especially as a result of the uks announced exit from the eu and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in u s dollars as well as financial statement line

the same period in 2016 primarily due to an increase in net investment income due to higher income on alternative investments primarily in our hedge fund portfolio lower general operating and other expenses reflecting strategic actions to reduce expenses a decrease in net realized capital losses reflecting foreign exchange losses in the first quarter of 2016 due to 483 million of remeasurement losses for a short term intercompany balance losses on sales of fixed maturity securities in the energy sector in the first quarter of 2016 higher other than temporary impairments in the first quarter of 2016 partially offset by derivative and hedge accounting losses in the first quarter of 2017 including losses from guaranteed living benefit embedded derivatives net of hedging primarily due to movement in the non performance or own credit spread adjustment npa driven by tightening credit spreads lower losses incurred in commercial insurance due to u s casualty portfolio improvements and the effect of the reinsurance arrangement with swiss re group and higher legacy portfolio fair value gains on certain investments income tax expense analysis for the three month period ended march 31 2017 the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 29 9 percent the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits associated with tax exempt income reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities and excess tax deductions related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement in accordance with asu 2016 09 partially offset by tax charges related to the disposition of subsidiaries and non deductible transfer pricing charges for the three month period ended march 31 2016 the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations was 27 1 percent the effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax charges and related interest associated with increases in uncertain tax positions related to cross border financing transactions partially offset by tax benefits associated with the impact of an agreement reached with the internal revenue service irs related to certain tax issues under audit reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities and a decrease in the deferred tax asset valuation allowances associated with certain foreign jurisdictions business segment operations our business operations consist of commercial insurance consumer insurance other

certain lines of business that creates downward market pressure on pricing tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business and volatility in claims arising from natural and man made catastrophes outlookindustry and economic factors below is a discussion of the industry and economic factors impacting our specific business liability and financial lines the liability and financial lines market remains challenging due to excess capacity which is continuing to negatively affect the rate environment despite this we continue to achieve rate increases in challenged areas of the portfolio and more broadly across casualty lines as we execute our portfolio optimization strategy in the first quarter of 2017 we have continued to observe the trend of increasing frequency of severe losses particularly in auto which is impacting not only the primary books but also having a leveraged impact on excess layers loss trends across most u s casualty lines remain elevated liability and financial lines has large international exposure within the total commercial insurance portfolio and will therefore remain sensitive to volatility in foreign currencies property and special risks in the first quarter of 2017 property and special risks experienced growth in certain of our targeted lines of business that led to positive results that met or exceeded our expectations and we expect such growth to continue throughout 2017 the u s large limit property business continues to be a strategic focus rates in more commoditized lines of business such as u s excess and surplus lines continue to be unsatisfactory and we intend to continue to reduce our net premiums written in these areas overall property and special risks experienced rate pressure in the first quarter of 2017 which is expected to continue in the near term particularly in the u s and europe property and special risks continues to differentiate its underwriting capacity from its peers by

excludes net loss reserve discount and the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain business and financial highlights the net premiums written decrease in the first quarter of 2017 was driven by ongoing portfolio optimization efforts and execution on our pricing strategy partially offset by growth in targeted lines of business the decrease in losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred was driven by lower net losses incurred resulting primarily from u s casualty portfolio improvements the effect of the reinsurance arrangement with the swiss re group and the recognition of the amortization of the deferred gain from the adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico these decreases were partially offset by the increase in our loss reserves due to the uk ministry of justices recent decision to significantly reduce the ogden discount rate used for calculating lump sum awards in the uk bodily injury cases the acquisition expense decrease was primarily related to the reinsurance arrangement with the swiss re group the general operating expense decrease was mainly driven by lower employee related expenses and other expense savings initiatives higher net investment income was due to higher income on alternative investments partially offset by lower interest and dividends due to lower invested assets resulting from the funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico we continue to reduce the relative size of our u s casualty portfolio within liability and financial lines and consequently expect net premiums written will continue to decline through 2017 in large part driven by the continued execution of our risk selection strategy alongside a disciplined underwriting approach liability and financial lines pre tax operating income three months ended march 31 in millions 2017 and 2016 comparison pre tax operating income increased slightly due to higher net investment income due to higher income on alternative investments partially offset by lower interest and dividends due to lower invested assets resulting from funding the adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico lower losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred resulting primarily from u s casualty portfolio improvements the effect of the reinsurance arrangement with the swiss re group and the amortization of the deferred gain from the adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico

quarter of 2017 less credit market volatility in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 with a marginal decrease in interest rates and narrowing of credit spreads resulted in a net unrealized gain in our investment portfolio net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 10 6 billion as of march 31 2017 from approximately 9 7 billion as of december 31 2016 we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income during the first quarter of 2017 we funded the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with nico the approximate 10 2 billion funding commitment was the primary reason for the decrease in the invested asset portfolio in the quarter during the first quarter of 2017 we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by approximately 564 million as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure our hedge fund portfolio experienced above average returns in the first quarter of 2017 due to higher equity market performance blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called other than temporary impairments decreased due to lower impairments in our structured securities and corporate bond portfolios the u s election and brexit vote created increased volatility in credit markets and exchange rates as well as within the equity markets in 2016 which may continue for some time investment strategies investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification some of our key investment strategies are as follows fixed maturity securities held by the u s insurance companies included in property casualty insurance companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk return tax liquidity credit quality and diversification objectives outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by property casualty insurance companies consist primarily of high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate while more of a focus is placed on asset liability management in life insurance companies our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics to the extent practicable aig parent included in other operations actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and duration aig parents liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer term funding needs aig parent purchases publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity the following table presents the components of net investment income data table removed a includes income from hedge funds private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships hedge funds for which we elected the fair value option are recorded as of the balance sheet date other hedge funds are generally reported on a one month lag while private equity funds are generally reported on a one quarter lag b primarily includes changes in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities where the fair value option has been elected and income on life settlements for the quarters ended march 31 2017 and march 31 2016 the investment income loss recorded on these securities was 127 million and 114 million respectively and on life settlements was 115 million and 126 million respectively net investment income in the first quarter of 2017 was higher than the same period in the prior year as higher income on alternative investments primarily in our hedge fund portfolio was partially offset by lower invested assets and blended investment yields on new investments that were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called attribution of net investment income to operating modules net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses for commercial insurance liability and financial lines property and special risks and consumer insurance personal insurance and legacy property casualty insurance run off lines we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums the allocation of net investment income of the property casualty insurance companies to modules is calculated based on these estimated investable funds consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the required economic capital allocation for each module for consumer insurance individual retirement group retirement and life insurance other operations institutional markets and legacy life insurance run off lines net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our life insurance companies all invested assets of the life insurance companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital allocation for each module asset liability measurement for the property casualty insurance companies the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines as a result the investment strategy within the property casualty insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital subject to liability and other business considerations the property casualty insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans while invested assets backing reserves of the property casualty insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields particularly in the domestic operations in addition we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset backed investments for their risk return attributes as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates this asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged we expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the property casualty insurance companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current riskreturn and tax objectives in addition the property casualty insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio fixed maturity securities of the property casualty insurance companies domestic operations with an average duration of 4 2 years are currently comprised primarily of tax exempt securities which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds government and agency bonds and corporate bonds the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings fixed maturity securities held in the property casualty insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings with an average duration of 3 6 years the investment strategy of the life insurance companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value subject to liquidity requirements capital constraints diversification requirements assetliability management and available investment opportunities the life insurance companies use assetliability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses the life insurance companies fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that to the extent practicable complements the characteristics of liabilities including duration which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities and as a result certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio the life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans in addition the life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields while a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the life insurance companies we intend to reduce the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio fixed maturity securities of the life insurance companies domestic operations with an average duration of 6 9 years are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds as well as taxable municipal and government bonds and agency and nonagency structured securities the majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings fixed maturity securities held in the life insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings with an average duration of 21 0 years naic designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office svo of the national association of insurance companies naic evaluates the investments of u s insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called naic designations in general naic designations of 1 highest quality or 2 high quality include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade while naic designations of 3 through 6 generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities including non agency rmbs and cmbs which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies the following tables summarize the ratings distribution of u s insurance companies fixed maturity security portfolio by naic designation and the distribution by composite aig

change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the first quarter of each of 2017 and 2016 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by 0 9 billion and 4 7 billion respectively due primarily to a decrease in rates and a narrowing of credit spreads see also note 6 investments to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment portfolio net realized capital gains and losses the

of prudential financial inc for the three months ended march 31 2016 net realized capital losses in the first quarter of 2017 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year net realized capital losses in the first quarter of 2017 were primarily related to derivative and hedge accounting losses and impairments which were higher than the foreign exchange gains and the gains recognized on the sales of securities derivative and hedge accounting losses were primarily a result of the fair value changes in derivative instruments used to economically hedge market risk from variable

maturity securities in the energy sector other than temporary impairments and foreign exchange losses partially offset by gains realized on the sale of class b shares of prudential financial inc foreign exchange losses were primarily due to 483 million of remeasurement losses for a short term intercompany balance that was matched with available for sale securities in fixed maturity securities

retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain net loss development in the first quarter of 2017 we recognized adverse prior year loss reserve development of 10 million we increased our loss reserves by 102 million as a result of the recent decision made by the uk ministry of justice to reduce the discount rate applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts known as the ogden rate to 0 75 percent our carried reserves at december 31 2016 were estimated using our assumption that the ogden rate would decline to 1 0 percent this discount rate change primarily impacted the europe casualty and financial lines this prior year loss reserve increase was almost entirely offset by the recognition of the amortization of the deferred gain from the adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico of 41 million and favorable development from property and special risks of 35 million as a result of a reduction in catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2016 we recognized favorable prior year loss reserve development of 66 million this was driven by favorable development from consumer personal insurance primarily in the japan region the following

claims and environmental claims and for reinsurance recoverable losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us these reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the tables above this may affect the comparability of the data presented in our tables significant reinsurance agreements effective january 1 2016 we entered into a two year reinsurance arrangement with the swiss reinsurance company ltd under which we ceded a proportional share of our new and renewal u s casualty portfolio in order to reduce the concentration of casualty business in our portfolio our 2017 catastrophe reinsurance program includes coverage for natural catastrophes and some coverage for terrorism events it consists of a large north american occurrence cover without reinstatement to protect against large north america losses and japan cover to protect against losses in japan the attachment point for this reinsurance program is at 1 5 billion for the north american cover down from 3 0 billion in 2016 and varies for the japan cover on january 20 2017 we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement adc with nico a subsidiary of berkshire under which we transferred to nico 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our u s commercial long tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior under this agreement we ceded to nico 80 percent of the paid losses on subject business paid on or after january 1 2016 in excess of 25 billion of net paid losses up to an aggregate limit of 25 billion at nicos 80 percent share nicos limit of liability under the contract is 20 billion we account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance we paid total consideration including interest of 10 2 billion the consideration was placed into a collateral trust account as security for nicos claim payment obligations and berkshire has provided a parental guarantee to secure the obligations of nico under the agreement the following table calculates the amount of the deferred gain recorded in the first quarter of 2017 on a nominal and net basis and showing the effect of discounting of loss reserves the deferred gain will be amortized over the settlement period of the reinsured losses data table removed the lines of business subject to this agreement have been the source of substantially all of the prior year adverse development charges over the past several years the agreement resulted in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our u s insurance subsidiaries under u s gaap any potential future prior year development would be recognized immediately as losses are incurred however the related recoveries under the reinsurance agreement would be deferred and recognized over the expected recovery period however consistent with our definition of ptoi excludes the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain in addition amortization of the deferred gain is recognized in ptoi based on the original amortization schedule at the time we entered into the agreement see part ii item 7 md and a enterprise risk management insurance risks reinsurance activities reinsurance recoverable in our 2016 annual report for a summary of significant reinsurers life and annuity reserves and dac the following section provides discussion of life and annuity reserves and dac variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results our individual retirement and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with gmwb riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features the liabilities for gmwb are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates equity prices credit spreads and market volatility in addition to risk mitigating features in our variable annuity product design we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb including exposures to changes in interest rates equity prices credit spreads and volatilities the hedging program utilizes derivative instruments including but not limited to equity options futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election see part ii item 7 md and a enterprise risk management insurance risks life insurance companies key insurance risks variable annuity risk management and hedging programs in our 2016 annual report for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders the economic hedge target differs from the u s gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivatives due to the following the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations the u s gaap valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for u s gaap valuation such as margins for policyholder behavior mortality and volatility and the economic hedge target excludes the non performance or own credit risk adjustment npa used in the u s gaap valuation which reflects a market participants view of our claims paying ability by incorporating an additional spread the npa spread to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits because the discount rate includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margins the u s gaap valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors and to changes from actuarial assumption updates than the economic hedge target the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program the life insurance companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns which may be either positive or negative realized volatility versus implied volatility actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging particularly policyholder behavior and risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge the following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the u s gaap embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target data table removed impact on pre tax income loss the impact on our pre tax income loss of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments both of which are recorded in other realized capital gains losses realized capital gains losses as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program are excluded from pre tax operating income of individual retirement and group retirement the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target the u s gaap embedded derivatives and changes in the fair value of the hedging portfolio as discussed above when corporate credit spreads widen the change in the npa spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a gain and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a loss in addition to changes driven by credit market related movements in the npa spread the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits the following table presents the net increase decrease to consolidated pre tax income loss from changes in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives and related hedges excluding related dac amortization data table removed the net impact on pre tax income from the gmwb and related hedges in the first quarter of 2017 excluding related dac amortization was primarily driven by losses on a u s gaap basis from the impact of tightening credit spreads on the npa spread and the impact on the npa volume of lower expected gmwb payments driven by higher equity markets in the first quarter of 2016 both components of the npa adjustment had a positive impact on pre tax income primarily due to widening of spreads and declining interest rates fair value losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by decreases in liabilities on a u s gaap basis due to the npa and other risk margins used for u s gaap valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio on an economic basis the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the decrease in the economic hedge target as discussed below change in economic hedge target the decrease in the economic hedge target liability in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to positive equity markets and increases in market interest rates but was partially offset by lower credit spreads and equity volatility change in fair value of the hedging portfolio the changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and to a lesser extent the embedded derivatives were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities primarily corporate bonds for which the fair value option has been elected are used as a capital efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread related risk the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program in the first quarter of 2017 was a small gain due to tightening of credit spreads while the first quarter of 2016 included more significant gains primarily due to decreases in market interest rates partially offset by the impact of widening credit spreads the change in the fair value of the hedging bonds which is excluded from the pre tax operating income of the individual retirement and group retirement segments is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of income loss changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts which included swaps swaptions and futures resulted in net losses in the first quarter of 2017 from higher rates compared to significant gains from interest rate declines in the first quarter of 2016 the change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts which included futures and options resulted in losses in the first quarter of 2017 and to a lesser extent in the first quarter of 2016 based on the relative change in equity market performance in the respective periods dac the following table summarizes the major components of the changes in dac including voba within the life insurance companies excluding dac of institutional markets and legacy

businesses the life insurance companies made tax sharing payments to aig parent in the first quarter of 2017 totaling 2 6 billion in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities primarily as a result of these reinsurance transactions fixed maturity securities used to fund dividends and tax sharing payments included u s government and government sponsored entity securities u s agency mortgage backed securities corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities credit facilities we maintain a committed revolving syndicated credit facility the facility as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes the facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and or standby letters of credit of up to 4 5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in november 2020 as of march 31 2017 a total of 4 5 billion remains available under the facility our ability to borrow under the facility is not contingent on our credit ratings however our ability to borrow under the facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal operating administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facility these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the facility would restrict our access to the facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity we expect to borrow under the facility from time to time and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes

the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments the amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets we believe that our life insurance companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations these subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments in addition our life insurance companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient we expect liquidity needs related to gic liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets borrowings our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value we expect to repay the long term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by aig through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets future cash flows from operations cash flows generated from invested assets future debt issuance and other financing arrangements borrowings supported

counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterpartys credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads we devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures these exposures may arise from but are not limited to fixed income investments equity securities deposits commercial paper investments reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements corporate and consumer loans leases reinsurance recoverables counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities collateral extended to counterparties insurance risk cessions to third parties financial guarantees and letters of credit we monitor and control our company wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations whether funded or unfunded to minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances we may require mitigants such as thirdparty

more of the following market risk drivers equity and commodity prices residential and commercial real estate values interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange inflation and their levels of volatility we are engaged in a variety of insurance investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk directly and indirectly we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off balance sheet exposures the chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks then ensuring that they are appropriately measured monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the chief market risk officer cmro the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables as opposed to the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function risk identification market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad external predominantly market observable risks financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations financial condition liquidity and capital each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk equity prices we are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares investments in private equity hedge funds and mutual funds exchange traded funds and other equity linked capital market instruments as well as equity linked insurance products including but not limited to index annuities variable annuities universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance residential and commercial real estate values our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments changes in residential commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential commercial mortgages residential commercial mortgagebacked securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential commercial mortgages trusts that include residential commercial real estate and or mortgages residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments interest rates interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors conversely higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons however when rates rise quickly there can be a temporary asymmetric gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value which is largely reported in other comprehensive income and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities financial liabilities insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities variable annuities and derivative contracts credit spreads credit spreads measure an instruments risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration defaultfree instrument changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including but not limited to corporate bonds abs mortgage backed securities aig issued debt obligations credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments much like higher interest rates wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the longterm in the short term quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities which is largely reported in other comprehensive income a precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the creditworthiness of bond obligors potentially resulting in default losses foreign exchange fx rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with income assets and liabilities denominated in and capital deployed in a variety of currencies changes in fx rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions commodity prices changes in commodity prices the value of commodities can affect the valuation of publiclytraded commodities commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices we are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio inflation changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including aig issued debt obligations derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly via indexing or implicitly through medical costs or wage levels risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures at the firmwide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aigs risk appetite statement this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels at the market risk level the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis in addition we continue to use enhanced economic gaap accounting and statutory capitalbased risk measures at the market risk level businessunit level and firmwide levels this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures we use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities and a one percent increase in prices of equity securities scenario analysis scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in worldwide equity markets scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses stress testing stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of rmbs or cmbs during 2008 market risk sensitivities the following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed a at march 31 2017 the analysis covered 267 1 billion of 281 6 billion interest rate sensitive assets excluded were 8 1 billion of loans and 2 1 billion of investments in life settlements in addition 4 3 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations at december 31 2016 the analysis covered 276 9 billion of 292 5 billion interest rate sensitive assets excluded were 8 1 billion of loans and 2 5 billion of investments in life settlements in addition 5 0 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations b the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag foreign currency denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated nonu s dollar assets less our consolidated nonu s dollar liabilities on a gaap basis with certain adjustments we use a bottom up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level at the aig parent level we monitor our single foreign currency exposures and limit the risk of the aggregate currency portfolio our foreign currency denominated net asset position at march 31 2017 decreased by 1 5 billion compared to december 31 2016 the decrease was primarily due to a 663 million decrease in our japanese yen position primarily due to unrealized depreciation of investments and weakening of the yen against the u s dollar a 188 million decrease in our taiwan dollar position due to the sale of our taiwan insurance unit and a 119 million and 108 million decrease in our euro and british pound positions respectively due to the weakening of the euro and pound against the u s dollar for illustrative purposes we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u s dollar the estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short term cash collateral or other financial obligations failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency reduced operating flexibility increased costs reputational harm and regulatory action aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario we maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions if we project that we will breach these tolerances we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions however the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements risk identification the following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short term financial obligations as they come due market monetization risk assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs cash flow mismatch risk discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls event funding risk additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings a market event or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options financing risk we may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions aig specific issues or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding risk measurement comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk we produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows in addition we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity we use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure including minimum liquidity limits minimum liquidity limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions coverage ratios coverage ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon the portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon cash flow forecasts cash flow forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon stress testing asset liquidity and coverage ratios are re measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows liquid assets and or other funding sources relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to aig parent and business unit risk committees the frequency content and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity based on its complexity risk profile activities and size regulatory environment our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities including insurance securities derivatives investment advisory and thrift regulators in the united states and abroad our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business the insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which a majority voted for the uk to withdraw its membership in the eu commonly referred to as brexit the terms of withdrawal are subject to a formal negotiation period which was initiated on march 29 2017 through the invocation of article 50 of the treaty on european union negotiations on brexit could by treaty last up to two years it is not clear at this stage and may not be for some time what
