future events or otherwise 69 table of contents the md and a is organized as follows index to item 2 data table removed 70 table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures use of non gaap measures throughout this md and a we present aig financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful representative and most transparent some of the measurements we use are non gaap financial measures under sec rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the non gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis we believe book value per common share excluding aoci is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of non cash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale portfolio and foreign currency translation adjustments book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented below in the executive overview section of this md and a we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of aig and our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided in the results of operations section of this md and a aig after tax operating income loss attributable to aig is derived by excluding the following items from net income income loss from discontinued operations net loss gain on sale of divested businesses income from divested businesses legacy tax adjustments primarily related to certain changes in uncertain tax positions fin 48 and other tax adjustments legal reserves settlements related to legacy crisis matters deferred income tax valuation allowance releases charges changes in fair value of aig life and retirement securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities change in benefit reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs dac value of business acquired voba and sales inducement assets sia related to net realized capital gains losses gain loss on extinguishment of debt net realized capital gains losses non qualifying derivative hedging activities excluding net realized capital gains losses bargain purchase gain and net income loss from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests legacy crisis matters include favorable and unfavorable settlements related to events leading up to and resulting from our september 2008 liquidity crisis and legal fees incurred by aig as the plaintiff in connection with such legal matters aig property casualty operating income loss includes both underwriting income loss and net investment income but excludes net realized capital gains losses other income expense legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above and bargain purchase gain underwriting income loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expense acquisition expense and general operating expense ratios aig property casualty along with most property and casualty insurance companies uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of claims and claims adjustment expense and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss ratio as adjusted the loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on aig property casualty in excess of 10 million each 71 item 2 use of non gaap measures accident year combined ratio as adjusted the combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting aig life and retirement operating income loss is derived by excluding the following items from net income loss legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above changes in fair values of fixed maturity securities designated to hedge living benefit liabilities net realized capital gains losses and changes in benefit reserves and dac voba and sia related to net realized capital gains losses we believe that operating income loss is useful because excluding these volatile items permits investors to better assess the operating performance of the underlying business by highlighting the results from ongoing operations premiums and deposits includes life insurance premiums and deposits on annuity contracts guaranteed investment contracts gics and mutual funds other operations operating income loss income loss excluding certain legal reserves settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above gain loss on extinguishment of debt net realized capital gains losses net gains losses on sale of divested businesses and properties and income from divested businesses results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures executive overview this overview of management discussion and analysis highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important

overview executive summary we continued our positive financial and operational performance during the first quarter of 2013 aig property casualty reported improved operating income and has continued to experience positive pricing trends aig life and retirement assets under management grew from deposits net flows from individual variable annuities and retail mutual funds and appreciation due to higher equity markets we continued to enhance spread income and actively manage the low interest rate environment mortgage guaranty reported new insurance written of 10 6 billion for the first quarter

from our previous investments in maiden lane ii llc ml ii maiden lane iii llc ml iii and aia group limited aia improved through yield enhancement initiatives including the reduction of our concentration in lower yielding tax exempt municipal securities and the purchase of higher yielding securities the investment portfolio performance also improved due to an increase in partnership income primarily as a result of favorable equity market performance realized capital gains improved because of lower other than temporary impairments and foreign exchange gains due to the strengthening of the u s dollar against the british pound euro and japanese yen our balance sheet is stronger as a result of our maturities repayments and purchases of 2 9 billion of debt including the redemption of 1 1 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7 70 percent series a 5 junior subordinated debentures due 2047 and our purchase in cash tender offers an aggregate principal amount of

changes prior period revenues and expenses were conformed to the current period presentation these changes did not affect income from continuing operations before income tax expense or net income attributable to aig also the presentation of the operating segments within the aig life and retirement segment was revised in the current period to reflect two new operating segments retail and institutional for further discussion see notes 1 and 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements investment highlights net investment income decreased 41 percent to 4 2 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 primarily due to fair value gains in the first quarter of 2012 on our investments in ml ii ml iii and aia which were liquidated during 2012 the overall credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was largely unchanged and other than temporary impairments declined significantly compared to prior year levels due in part to favorable developments in the housing sector which resulted in strong performance in our structured products portfolios our insurance operations achieved a 110 million increase in net investment income in spite of the challenges presented by a continuing low interest rate environment net investment income improved due to higher partnership income driven primarily by equity market gains which was partially offset by the absence of ml ii gains in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 2012 while corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations we continued to focus on risk weighted opportunistic investments in residential mortgage backed rmbs and other structured securities to improve yields 75 item 2 executive overview other than temporary impairments were significantly lower than the prior year in part driven by favorable developments in the housing sector which led to strong performance in our structured products portfolios strategic outlook industry trends our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates credit and equity market conditions regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continue to operate under difficult market conditions in 2013 characterized by factors such as low interest rates instability in the global markets due to the european debt crisis uncertainly in the far east and slow growth in the u s economy low interest rates in the u s fixed income market have significantly affected our industry by reducing investment returns in addition current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines aig priorities for 2013 aig is focused on the following priorities for 2013 strengthen and improve the operating performance of our core businesses consummate the sale of up to 90 percent of our interest in ilfc enhance the yield on our investments while maintaining focus on credit quality manage our capital and interest expense more efficiently by improving our capital structure and redeploying excess capital in areas that promote profitable growth work with the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb in its capacity as our principal regulator and reduce operating expenses by leveraging our scale and driving increased standardization through investments in infrastructure outlook for our operating businesses the outlook for each of our businesses and management initiatives to improve growth and performance in 2013 and over the longer term is summarized below see our 2012 annual report for additional information concerning strategic initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses aig property casualty outlook we expect that the current low interest rate environment and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets through at least the end of 2013 due to these conditions coupled with overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry we have sought to tighten terms and conditions shed unprofitable business and develop advanced data analytics in order to improve profitability we have observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges commencing in the second quarter of 2011 and continuing since we have benefitted from favorable pricing trends particularly in our u s commercial business the property casualty insurance industry is experiencing modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in some markets we expect that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions 76 item 2 executive overview aig property casualty strategic initiatives and opportunities business mix shift continue shifting toward higher value business to increase profitability expand in attractive growth economies specifically in asia pacific the middle east and latin america underwriting excellence enhance risk selection and pricing to earn returns commensurate to the risk assumed claims best practices implement improved claims practices and advanced technology to lower the loss ratio operating expense discipline apply operating expense discipline and increase efficiencies by taking full advantage of our global footprint capital efficiency continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency investment strategy continue to execute our investment strategy which includes increased asset diversification and yield enhancement opportunities that meet our liquidity risk and return objectives capital efficiency we continue to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broad based risk tolerance guidelines for our operating units implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends in addition we remain focused on enhancing our global reinsurance strategy to improve capital efficiency we continue to streamline our legal entity structure to enhance transparency with regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency in the first quarter of 2013 we completed six legal entity and branch restructuring transactions effective march 29 2013 we simplified the ownership structure of our surplus lines carriers in the u s to facilitate efficient capital allocation additionally effective april 1 2013 the bermuda branch business of chartis excess limited was transferred to american international reinsurance company airco to simplify our business operations in bermuda airco will be our primary insurance operation based in bermuda our restructuring and capital management initiatives will enable airco to make capital available to be used by aig property casualty for general corporate purposes we made significant progress with respect to legal entity restructuring activities in the asia pacific region on april 1 2013 we completed the integration of most of our japan operations under one licensed insurance holding company aig japan holdings kk which holds the majority of our insurance companies and service companies that operate in japan the transaction is expected to enhance dividend capacity in the future we continue to implement restructuring plans in each region and the overall restructuring is expected to be mostly completed by the end of 2014 subject to regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions aig life and retirement outlook aig life and retirement businesses and the life and annuity industry continue to be affected by the current economic environment of low interest rates and volatile equity markets continued low interest rates put pressure on long term investment returns negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing businesses products such as payout annuities and traditional life insurance that are not rate adjustable may require increases in reserves if future investment yields fall to a level that results in expected future losses also low interest rates can affect the recoverability and accelerate the amortization of dac assets held with respect to our variable annuity fixed annuity and universal life businesses equity market volatility may result in higher reserves for variable annuity guarantee features and can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of dac assets 77 item 2 executive overview aig life and retirement has implemented a number of actions to address the impact of low interest rates these actions include a disciplined approach to pricing new business related to interest sensitive products e g fixed annuities and active management of renewal crediting rates we have filed new life insurance and annuity products with reduced minimum rate guarantees aig life and retirement strategic initiatives and opportunities assets under management fully leverage our unified distribution organization to increase sales of profitable products across all channels capitalize on the growing demand for income solutions and on aig life and retirement capital base risk controls innovative product designs expanded distribution initiatives and financial discipline to grow our variable annuity business pursue selected institutional market opportunities where aig life and retirement scale and capital base provide a competitive advantage increase life insurance in force develop innovative life offerings through consumer focused research that delivers superior differentiated product solutions consolidate life insurance platforms operations and systems to create a more efficient cost competitive and agile operating model enhance return on equity we completed the merger of six life insurance operating legal entities into american general life insurance company effective december 31 2012 we expect to leverage our streamlined legal entity structure to enhance financial strength and durability efficient capital allocation and the ease of doing business investment strategy consistent with aig worldwide insurance investment policy aig life and retirement places primary emphasis on investments in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among others residential and commercial real estate commercial mortgage loans and to a lesser extent private equity hedge funds other alternative investments and common and preferred stocks our fundamental investment strategy is to maintain primarily a diversified high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities with the intent to match the established duration targets based on the characteristics of its liabilities in addition aig life and retirement enhances its returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds hedge funds and affordable housing partnerships although these investments are subject to periodic volatility they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed income portfolio yields aig life and retirement expectation is that these alternative investments will continue to outperform the fixed income portfolio yields over the long term while providing important diversification to our investment portfolio aig life and retirement continues to make investments in structured securities and fixed income securities with attractive and appropriate risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income 78 item 2 executive overview other operations outlook mortgage guaranty mortgage guaranty strategic initiatives and opportunities underwriting discipline the mortgage market continues to show signs of improvement with increasing levels of originations house value appreciation and tight mortgage underwriting standards these trends combined with the modest improvement of u s macroeconomic conditions have had a favorable impact on our operating results most notably on the quality of business written since 2009 our risk based pricing strategy has positioned ugc to take advantage of these improving market conditions and has resulted in the underwriting of a high quality book of business over the last four years ugc plans to continue to execute this strategy during 2013 and to further enhance its risk based pricing model ugc will continue to review its new business pricing relative to changes in the market to ensure that the price of coverage is commensurate with the level of risk being underwritten increase new business production through competitor differentiation beginning in 2009 ugc has differentiated itself from competitors through its risk based pricing model that is designed to identify high quality new business and competitively price the associated risks global capital markets gcm aig markets inc aig markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between aig and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services the derivative portfolio of aig markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives the remaining derivatives portfolio of aig financial products corp and aig trading group inc and their respective subsidiaries collectively aigfp consists primarily of hedges of the assets and liabilities of the dib and a portion of the legacy hedges for aig and its subsidiaries aigfp derivative portfolio consists primarily of interest rate currency credit commodity and equity derivatives additionally aigfp has a credit default swap portfolio being managed for economic benefit and with limited risk the aigfp portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistent with our risk management objectives although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility it consists predominantly of transactions that we believe are of low complexity low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis direct investment book dib the dib portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all its liabilities as they come due even under stress scenarios and to maximize return consistent with our risk management objectives we are focused on meeting the dib liquidity needs including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the dib without relying on resources beyond the dib as part of this program management we may from time to time access the capital markets subject to market conditions in addition we may seek to buy back debt or sell assets on an opportunistic basis subject to market conditions from time to time we may utilize cash allocated to the dib that is not required to meet the risk target for general corporate purposes unrelated to the dib certain non derivative assets and liabilities of the dib are accounted for under the fair value option and thus operating results are subject to periodic market volatility the overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the dib is executed by gcm the value of hedges related to the non derivative assets and liabilities of aigfp in the dib is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of gcm and is not included within the dib operating results assets or liabilities 79 table of contents item 2 results of

metrics that provide management with measures to evaluate our profitability such as a risk adjusted profitability model along with underwriting results this risk adjusted profitability model incorporates elements of capital allocations costs of capital and net investment income we believe that such performance measures will allow us to better assess the true economic returns of our business aig property casualty first quarter 2013 highlights net premiums written decreased by four percent in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year we now recognize ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contract rather than ratably over the contract period in addition the timing of the 2013 catastrophe bond issuance decreased net premiums written excluding the impact of these items commercial insurance net premiums written increased by over four percent in the first quarter of 2013 partially offset by a two percent decrease in consumer insurance due to the strengthening of the u s dollar against the japanese yen the loss ratio improved by 4 7 points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the benefit from positive pricing trends the continued effect of the execution of our strategic initiatives which we began implementing in the second half of 2011 as well as lower catastrophe losses favorable net prior year development including related premium adjustments during the period contributed approximately one point to the overall decrease in the loss ratio the acquisition ratio decreased by 0 5 points due to decreases in the commercial insurance acquisition ratio which were partially offset by increases in the consumer insurance acquisition ratio the general operating expense ratio increased by 0 4 points due to an increase in personnel related costs which was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year net investment income increased by 11 percent in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the strong

development including premium adjustments was 52 million and 47 million for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 respectively see liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense for further discussion of prior year development acquisition expenses decreased primarily due to the timing of certain guaranty funds and other assessments in commercial insurance which were partially offset by higher commission rates in consumer insurance general operating expenses increased due to an increase in the cost of our employee incentive plans of 34 million primarily as a result of accelerated vesting provisions for retirement eligible individuals for the 2013 plan awards and increases in accruals for previously granted awards based on our stock price performance as well as a 42 million increase due to the implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in japan this was offset by decreases in bad debt expense and lower expenses related to strategic initiatives bad debt expense

decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the execution of our strategy to improve loss ratios our enhanced risk selection process and adherence to pricing targets resulted in the non renewal of approximately 80 million of net premiums written in the first quarter of 2013 primarily within the workers compensation business in the americas and within the primary casualty business in emea we also entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement in the u s for the excess casualty business that decreased net premiums written by 72 million in 2013 we implemented rate increases in retained business especially in the u s that partially offset these premium decreases growth in property new business and changes to our per risk reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure was more than offset by additional ceded premiums written in the first quarter of 2013 as described below catastrophe exposed business in the americas also benefitted from rate increases effective january 1 2013 we recognize the annual ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements at the inception of the contract rather than ratably over the contract period previously we recognized ceded premiums written on these agreements based on the quarterly contractual remittance requirements and recorded an adjustment at the end of the contract term to reflect the actual ceded premiums written amounts this change resulted in the acceleration of ceded premiums written to earlier quarters but had only a de minimis effect on net premiums earned for the first quarter of 2013 ceded premiums written increased by 398 million compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of this change the impact on net premiums written from this change will reverse throughout the rest of 2013 net premiums written also reflected the timing of a 2013 catastrophe bond issuance we have continued the strategy adopted in 2010 to improve the allocation of our reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets during the first quarter of 2013 as part of this strategy we secured a three year catastrophe bond providing for up to 400 million in protection on u s hurricanes and earthquakes to the extent both industry losses and our actual losses exceed specific thresholds the bond transaction reduced net premiums written by 96 million in the first quarter of 2013 our previous catastrophe bond issuance occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 specialty net premiums written decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to rate pressure in the european aerospace and marine markets this decrease was slightly offset by rate increases in small and medium sized enterprises and environmental business additionally we continue to restructure our reinsurance program to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure which increased net premiums written by 40 million in the first quarter of 2013 financial lines net premiums written increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting growth in new business related to targeted growth products as well as an improved rate environment globally global professional indemnity net premiums written increased by 35 million due to the restructuring of our reinsurance program as part of our decision to retain more favorable risks while continuing to manage aggregate exposure as well as by improved rates and strong new business growth consumer insurance net premiums written consumer insurance net premiums written decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as the u s dollar strengthened against the japanese yen and the effect of the excess of loss reinsurance ceded written premiums discussed above excluding these items net premiums written in the first quarter of 2013 increased compared to the same period in the prior year as the business continued to build momentum through multiple distribution channels and continuing focus on direct marketing in the first quarter of 2013 net premiums written generated by direct marketing increased by approximately 8 percent compared to the same period in the prior year and accounted for approximately 16 percent of consumer insurance business excluding foreign exchange a and h net premiums written increased as a result of our focus on the growth of fuji life products direct marketing and individual a and h in asia in addition travel business continued to increase in most geographies across the globe including in emea americas continued its strategy of repositioning u s direct 90 item 2 results of operations marketing operations and maintaining our pricing discipline and underwriting targets as a result several programs in the group personal accident business were not renewed in the first quarter of 2013 excluding foreign exchange personal lines net premiums written increased as a result of growth in automobile products and the continued execution of our strategic initiative to grow higher value lines of business in non automobile products automobile products reported growth in emea as our market share continued to improve over local competition in key countries non automobile products also reported continued growth including increases in europe personal lines specialty products and personal property in asia due to our focus on diversifying the global product mix these increases were partially offset by a 47 million increase in ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements previously discussed in addition the timing of the catastrophe bond issuance reduced net premiums written by 20 million aig property casualty net premiums written by region the following table presents aig property casualty net premiums written by region data table removed 91 item 2 results of operations the americas net premiums written decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the effect of the increase in ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements discussed above of approximately 210 million and approximately 120 million due to the timing of a catastrophe bond issuance these items which affected both commercial insurance and consumer insurance were partially offset by rate increases in commercial insurance and by continued growth in the personal property and private client group in consumer insurance asia pacific net premiums written decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the strengthening of the u s dollar against the japanese yen excluding foreign exchange net premiums written increased primarily due to an increase in consumer insurance reflecting growth of fuji life products and direct marketing business in japan the expansion in asia pacific countries outside of japan also continued in the first quarter of 2013 supported by growth in individual personal accident insurance direct marketing and personal lines products commercial insurance increased in the region primarily due to organic growth and rate increases in property specialty and casualty in addition retention in property and specialty increased during the first quarter of 2013 emea net premiums written decreased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the change in methodology for recognizing ceded premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance agreements discussed above of approximately 230 million partially offset by commercial insurance growth due to new business growth and rate improvements on retained business as well as modest growth in consumer insurance travel warranty and specialty personal lines products 92 item 2 results of operations aig property casualty underwriting ratios the following table presents the aig property casualty combined ratios based on gaap data and reconciliation to the accident year combined ratio as adjusted data table removed 93 table of contents item 2 results of operations given the nature of the lines of business and the expenses included in other we have determined that the traditional underwriting measures of loss ratio acquisition ratio general operating expense ratio and combined ratio do not provide an appropriate measure of underwriting performance therefore these ratios are not separately presented for other the following table presents aig property casualty accident year catastrophe losses by major event and severe losses data table removed events shown in the above table are catastrophic insured events having a net impact in excess of 10 million each severe losses are defined as non catastrophe individual first party losses greater than 10 million net of related reinsurance 94 item 2 results of operations commercial insurance ratios the improvement in the accident year loss ratio as adjusted for the first quarter of 2013 reflects the realization of benefits from the continued execution of our multi faceted strategy to enhance risk selection pricing discipline exposure management and claims processing although the execution of these strategies resulted in a reduction of casualty net premiums written it also improved the accident year loss ratio as we remediated our primary and excess casualty books in both the americas and emea regions financial lines improved due to rate strengthening restructuring and re underwriting of certain products severe losses in the first quarter of 2013 totaled approximately 60 million compared to 42 million in the first quarter of 2012 and are included in the accident year loss ratio as adjusted the acquisition ratio decreased by 1 7 points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to insurance related assessments the general operating expense ratio decreased by 0 4 points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense of 55 million slightly offset by the employee incentive compensation plan increases previously discussed of 26 million consumer insurance ratios the accident year loss ratio as adjusted increased in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year the underwriting income for the first quarter of 2012 included a benefit of approximately 45 million from refinements to certain actuarial assumptions within the a and h line of business this was partially offset by improvements in personal lines primarily automobile as a result of rate actions taken in prior years in japan as well as by improvements in europe specialty business and in the u s private client group the acquisition ratio increased by 1 2 points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to higher commissions in lines of business targeted for growth and an increase in direct marketing expenses overall net commissions increased by 1 2 percent driven by higher growth in fuji life products and individual a and h direct marketing costs increased by approximately 22 percent in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year the general operating expense ratio increased by 0 8 points primarily as a result of the employee incentive compensation increases previously discussed other category we incurred higher costs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily related to our implementation of a voluntary early retirement plan in japan which contributed approximately 0 6 points to the aig property casualty general operating expense ratio we continue to invest in a number of strategic initiatives including the implementation of global finance and information systems compliance with the regulatory requirements of the frb legal entity restructuring and underwriting and claims improvement initiatives the costs of these initiatives which are not specific to either commercial insurance or consumer insurance are reported as part of the other category in the first quarter of 2013 such costs totaled 40 million representing a decrease of approximately 12 million over the same period in 2012 aig property casualty investing and other results the following table presents aig property casualty investing and other results data table removed 95 item 2 results of operations we manage and account for our invested assets on a legal entity basis in conformity with regulatory requirements within a legal entity invested assets are available to pay claims and expenses of both commercial insurance and consumer insurance operating segments as well as the other category invested assets are not segregated or otherwise separately identified for the commercial insurance and consumer insurance operating segments investment income is allocated to the commercial insurance and consumer insurance operating segments based on an internal investment income allocation model the model estimates investable funds based primarily on loss reserves unearned premium and a capital allocation for each segment the investment income allocation is calculated based on the estimated investable funds and risk free yields plus an illiquidity premium consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities the actual yields in excess of the allocated amounts and the investment income from the assets not attributable to the commercial insurance and the consumer insurance operating segments are assigned to the other category commencing in the first quarter of 2013 we began applying similar duration and risk free yields plus an illiquidity premium to the allocated capital of commercial insurance and consumer insurance as is applied to loss reserves net realized capital gains losses and other income expense net are not allocated to commercial insurance and consumer insurance but are reported as part of the other category net investment income net investment income is influenced by a number of factors including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows the interest rate environment and changes in overall asset allocation certain of our structured securities are accounted for under the fair value option which may also increase the volatility of our net investment income the increase in the fair value of structured securities in the first quarter of 2013 was offset by a decrease in interest income from available for sale securities net investment income increased by 135 million or 11 percent in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to the strong performance in equity partnership investments corporate debt securities continues to be our largest asset category we continued to reduce our concentration in lower yielding tax exempt municipal bond holdings and focus on risk weighted opportunistic investments in higher yielding assets such as structured securities this asset diversification has achieved an increase in average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity investments were largely unchanged we expect to continue to execute our investment strategy in 2013 to meet our liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives net investment income from investment categories other than debt securities increased by 133 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 approximately 125 million was attributed to the strong performance of equity partnership investments following an 8 percent increase in the s and p 500 index income from the life settlement portfolios also increased by approximately 35 million during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 net realized capital gains losses net realized capital gains in the first quarter of 2013 were driven by gains recognized on the sale of fixed maturity and equity securities of 71 million partially offset by impairment charges on life settlement contracts of approximately 49 million as a result of decreases in their estimated fair value and other than temporary impairment charges of 18 million net realized capital losses in the first quarter of 2012 were driven by impairment charges of 58 million on life settlement contracts and other than temporary impairments of 94 million attributable to rmbs and 98 million attributable to partnership investments which were offset in part by the gains on fixed maturity securities of 169 million 96 table of contents item 2 results of operations liability for unpaid claims and claims

loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including estimates for ibnr and loss expenses less applicable discount for future investment income we regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in operating income because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase prior years estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease prior years estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable net of an allowance for unrecoverable

we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed our loss reserves as of march 31 2013 in our opinion such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves data table removed see

respective years in the table above data table removed 99 item 2 results of operations net loss development in determining the loss development from prior accident years we analyze and evaluate the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable as appropriate we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence as part of our reserving process we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues such as those related to the u s mortgage and housing market for the three month period ended march 31 2013 the net favorable development was driven by reserve decreases on claims in the commercial insurance and consumer insurance operating segments that was partially offset by net adverse development in reserves in other the net favorable development in commercial insurance was primarily attributable to the reduction of reserves on large excess casualty cases and favorable development in domestic property exposures and partially offset by adverse development in the primary casualty lines the favorable development in consumer insurance was due to lower than expected losses on natural catastrophe and non catastrophe exposures in personal lines the adverse development in other included adverse development on legacy asbestos and environmental exposures 1986 and prior and adverse development on run off environmental exposures 1987 2003 for the three month period ended march 31 2012 the net adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in commercial insurance and other partially offset by net favorable development in reserves in consumer insurance the net adverse development in commercial insurance was primarily attributable to the increase in reserves on large excess casualty cases primarily casualty and environmental business policies written after 1987 partially offset by favorable development in domestic property exposures and catastrophe losses the favorable development in consumer insurance was due to lower than expected losses on natural catastrophe losses in personal lines the adverse development in other included adverse development on run off environmental exposures 1987 2003 aig property casualty recognized additional premiums on loss sensitive business of 10 million and 6 million for the three month period ended march 31 2013 and 2012 respectively and incurred reinstatement premiums of 14 million in 2013 associated with the development on prior years catastrophes see aig property casualty results herein and other operations other operations results mortgage guaranty for further discussion of net loss development asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2012 annual report aig reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground up analysis performed periodically in the first quarter of 2013 a minor amount of incurred loss pertaining to the asbestos loss reserve discount was recognized in the first quarter of 2013 aig increased its gross and net environmental reserves by 18 million this development is primarily attributable to development on one large account expected to be settled in the near future in addition to the u s asbestos and environmental reserve amounts shown in the

program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in equity markets interest rates and volatilities related to embedded derivative liabilities contained in guaranteed benefit features of variable annuities we substantially hedge our exposure to equity markets however due to regulatory capital considerations a portion of our interest rate exposure is unhedged in the first quarter of 2012 we began purchasing u s treasury bonds as a capital efficient strategy to reduce our interest rate risk exposure over time as a result of increases in interest rates on u s treasury securities the fair value of the u s treasury securities used for hedging net of financing costs decreased by 29 million net realized capital gains losses net realized capital gains were 156 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a loss of 466 million in the first quarter of 2012 while gains from sales activity were comparable to 2012 results were positively impacted by foreign currency transaction gains in the first quarter of 2013 lower other than temporary impairments and lower fair value losses on variable annuity embedded derivatives net of hedges the large embedded derivative losses in 2012 were primarily due to declining credit spreads in the first quarter of 2012 changes in benefit reserves and dac voba and sia related to net realized capital gains losses in conjunction with a program to utilize capital loss tax carryforwards we sold investments in the first quarter of both 2013 and 2012 these and other sales with subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered loss recognition on certain long term payout annuity contracts of 102 million in the first quarter of 2013 and 87 million in the same period of 2012 which effectively transferred shadow loss recognition from unrealized included in aoci to actual loss recognition included in policyholder benefits and claims incurred and to a much lesser extent transferred shadow dac included in aoci to amortization of deferred acquisition costs additional sales of such securities are contemplated in the remainder of 2013 which could result in additional loss recognition assumptions related to investment yields mortality experience and expenses are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate which could also result in additional loss recognition reserves in addition due to the reinvestment of the assets at lower yields earnings related to this payout annuity block of business are expected to decline in the reminder of 2013 the following table summarizes the major components of the changes in aig life and retirement dac voba data table removed because aig life and retirement operates in various markets the estimated gross profits used to amortize dac and voba are subject to differing market returns and interest yield assumptions in any single period the combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products dac and voba for insurance oriented investment oriented and group retirement products are reviewed for recoverability which involves estimating the future profitability of current business this review involves significant judgment see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2012 annual report for additional

reluctant to purchase these products at the relatively low crediting rates currently offered group retirement deposits which include deposits into mutual funds and fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets decreased due to lower levels of individual rollover deposits and periodic deposits in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012

first quarter of 2013 primarily driven by lower deposits and higher surrenders for group retirement products driven by actions we took to mitigate a prolonged low interest rate environment net flows also declined due to lower fixed annuity deposits compared to the first quarter of 2012 resulting from the low interest rate environment these decreases were offset by improvements in net flows for individual variable annuities due to both increases in deposits and favorable surrender experience 109 item 2 results of operations the following table presents aig life and retirement insurance

table removed excludes mutual funds of 12 8 billion and 10 7 billion at march 31 2013 and 2012 respectively low interest rate environment a variety of factors affect aig life and retirement businesses and the life insurance and annuity industry in general during a prolonged low interest rate environment declining interest rates result in higher fair values of assets backing insurance and annuity liabilities and may result in improved persistency of certain lines of business a sustained low interest rate environment may also result in lower sales of fixed annuities and other products and lower net investment spreads as portfolio cash flows are reinvested at lower rates spread compression we have taken a number of actions to mitigate these impacts as discussed below aig life and retirement has addressed the impact of sustained low interest rates with a number of actions taken on both the asset and liability sides of our balance sheet opportunistic investment in structured securities to increase yields continued disciplined approach to new business pricing active management of renewal credited rates re priced certain life insurance and annuity products to reflect current low rate environment re filed certain products to continue lowering minimum rate guarantees included product limits where appropriate to minimize exposure to low interest rates as a result of these actions we estimate that the effect of interest rates remaining at or near current levels through the end of 2013 on pre tax operating income would not be material and would be modestly more significant with respect to 2014 results opportunistic investments the majority of assets backing insurance and annuity liabilities consists of intermediate and long term fixed maturity securities we generally purchase assets with the intent of matching expected maturities of the insurance liabilities an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability maturities from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses opportunistic investments in structured securities private placement corporate debt securities and mortgage loans continue to be made to improve yields increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment disciplined new business pricing new fixed annuity sales have declined in the first quarter of 2013 relative to the first quarter of 2012 due to the relatively low crediting rates offered as a result of our disciplined approach to new business however even in the current interest rate environment we continue to pursue new sales of life and annuity products at targeted net investment spreads new sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of 1 percent universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on 111 item 2 results of operations new non indexed products and 1 percent on new indexed products and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted net investment spreads active management of renewal credited rates the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in our products may have the effect in a continued low interest rate environment of reducing our spreads and thus reducing future profitability although we partially mitigate this interest rate risk through our asset liability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability our annuity and universal life products were designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees we have adjusted and will continue to adjust crediting rates to maintain targeted net investment spreads on both new business and in force business where crediting rates are above minimum guarantees in addition to annuity and universal life products certain traditional long duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates such as payout annuities are exposed to reduced earnings and potential reserve increases in a prolonged low interest rate environment as indicated in the table below approximately 73 percent of our annuity and universal life account values are at their minimum crediting rates as of march 31 2013 an increase from 61 percent at december 31 2012 these products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of march 31 2013 ranging from 1 percent to 5 5 percent with the higher rates representing guarantees on older products data table removed effective product management aig life and retirement has a dynamic product management process designed to ensure that new business product offerings appropriately reflect the current low interest rate environment to the extent that we cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business products are re priced

including requirements arising out of reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events through cash from operations and to the extent necessary dispositions of invested assets mortgage guaranty subsidiaries maintain substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments totaling 419 million as of march 31 2013 mortgage guaranty businesses also maintain significant levels of investment grade fixed maturity securities which could be monetized in the event liquidity levels are insufficient to meet obligations these securities included substantial holdings in municipal and corporate bonds totaling 3 7 billion at march 31 2013 global capital markets gcm acts as the derivatives intermediary between aig and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services it executes its derivative trades under international swaps and derivatives association inc isda agreements the agreements with third parties typically require collateral postings many of gcm transactions with aig and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements however generally no collateral is called under these contracts unless it is needed to satisfy posting requirements with third parties most of gcm cds are subject to collateral posting provisions these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes the amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of our credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor we estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior cds using various methodologies the contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions as of march 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively gcm had total assets of 8 6 billion and 8 0 billion and total liabilities of 4 2 billion and 4 9 billion gcm assets consist primarily of cash short term investments other receivables net of allowance and unrealized gains on swaps options and forwards gcm liabilities consist primarily of trade payables and unrealized losses on swaps options and forwards collateral posted included in gcm to third parties was 3 9 billion and 4 2 billion at march 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively gcm obtained collateral from third parties totaling 751 million and 846 million at march 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively the collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under master netting agreements and are inclusive of collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date direct investment book the dib is managed so that it maintains the liquidity that we believe is necessary to meet all of the dib liabilities as they come due even under stress scenarios without having to liquidate dib assets or rely on additional liquidity from aig parent if the dib risk target is breached we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the dib liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under then prevailing market conditions any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by aig parent the dib assets consist primarily of cash short term investments fixed maturity securities issued by u s government and government sponsored entities mortgage and asset backed securities and to a lesser extent bank loans and mortgage loans the dib liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short term financing obligations as of march 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively the dib had total assets of 26 4 billion and 28 5 billion and total liabilities of 22 7 billion and 23 8 billion the overall hedging activity for the assets and liabilities of the dib is executed by gcm the value of hedges related to the non derivative assets and liabilities of aigfp in the dib is included within the assets and liabilities and operating results of gcm and are not included within the dib operating results assets or liabilities collateral posted by operations included in the dib to third parties was 4 3 billion at both march 31 2013 and december 31 2012 this collateral primarily consists of securities of the u s government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties 126 table of contents item 2 liquidity and capital resources credit facilities we maintain a committed revolving four year syndicated credit facility the four year facility as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes the four year facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit we currently expect to replace or extend the four year facility on or prior to its expiration in october 2016 although no assurance can be given that the four year facility will be replaced on favorable terms or at all the four year facility entered into on october 5 2012 provides for 4 0 billion of unsecured revolving loans which includes a 2 0 billion letter of credit sublimit as of march 31 2013 a total of approximately 3 0 billion remains available under the four year facility of which approximately 1 0 billion remains available for letters of credit our ability to borrow under the four year facility is not contingent on our credit ratings however our ability to borrow under the four year facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal operating administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the four year facility these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the four year facility would restrict our access to the four year facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity we expect to borrow under the four year facility from time to time and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes contingent liquidity facilities aig parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to 500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes under this facility we have the unconditional right prior to december 15 2015 to issue up to 500 million in senior debt to the counterparty based on a put option agreement between aig parent and the counterparty our ability to borrow under this facility is not contingent on our credit ratings contractual obligations the following table summarizes contractual obligations in total and by remaining maturity data table removed a includes 24 1 billion of borrowings related to

aig life and retirement businesses these liabilities include various investment type products with contractually scheduled maturities including periodic payments of a term certain nature these liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations for these policies and contracts i we are currently not making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event such as death or disability ii payments are conditional on survivorship or iii payment may occur due to a surrender or other non scheduled event out of our control we have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits these assumptions include mortality morbidity future lapse rates expenses investment returns and interest crediting rates offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in force policies due to the significance of the assumptions the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments the amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the condensed consolidated balance sheet we believe that aig life and retirement subsidiaries have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations these subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments in addition aig life and retirement businesses maintain significant levels of investment grade fixed income securities including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient we expect liquidity needs related to gic liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from maturities and sales of invested assets loss reserves relate to the aig property casualty and the mortgage guaranty businesses and represent future loss and loss adjustment expense payments estimated based on historical loss development payment patterns due to the significance of the assumptions used the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments we believe that aig property casualty and mortgage guaranty subsidiaries maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations borrowings our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value we expect to repay the long term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by aig and its

each operating unit the investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for aig property casualty aig life and retirement and the direct investment book the primary objectives are generation of investment income preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities market conditions our investments and investment strategies were affected by the following conditions in the first quarter of 2013 central banks initiated actions intended to improve weakening economic conditions including the european central bank commitment to further bond purchases and the u s federal reserve commitment to maintain the federal funds rate in the zero to a quarter percent range the federal reserve also committed to support the mortgage market via purchases of agency mortgage backed securities and extended operation twist a program of redeeming short term u s treasury securities and using the proceeds to buy longer term u s treasury securities with the objective of putting downward pressure on longer term interest rates equity markets experienced positive returns and reached record highs in the first quarter of 2013 bond yields remained low although the 10 year u s treasury rate temporarily increased above 2 percent before retreating to 1 85 percent at the end of the quarter investment grade interest rates increased during the first quarter the u s dollar strengthened by 3 percent 7 percent and 9 percent against the euro british pound and japanese yen respectively investment strategies at the local operating unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market general market conditions liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification in the case of aig life and retirement as well as in the dib our fundamental investment strategy is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration to the extent practicable fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in aig property casualty historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk to meet the current risk return and tax objectives of aig property casualty cash flows from the investment portfolio and insurance operations are generally being reinvested by the domestic property and casualty companies in taxable instruments which meet the companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by aig property casualty companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate aig parent liquidity resources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities aig parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and tenor during the first quarter of 2013 upon an assessment of its immediate and longer term funding needs aig parent purchased publicly traded intermediate term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity 134 item 2 investments investment highlights the following is an overview of investment activities during the first quarter of 2013 we continued to make risk weighted opportunistic investments in rmbs and other structured securities to improve yields and increase net investment income blended investment yields on new aig life and retirement and aig property casualty investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called an increase in rates in investment grade asset classes more than offset a continued narrowing of spreads on below investment grade securities resulting in net unrealized losses in the investment portfolio other than temporary impairments continued their downward trend with structured securities experiencing only minor impairments in the quarter credit ratings at march 31 2013 approximately 88 percent of fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities approximately 18 percent of such securities were rated aaa by one or more of the principal rating agencies and approximately 15 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings third party rating services ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis a significant portion of our foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by moody s and p or similar foreign rating services rating services are not available for some foreign issued securities our credit risk management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio non rated fixed maturity securities at march 31 2013 approximately 15 percent of such investments were either rated aaa or on the basis of our internal analysis were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated aaa and approximately 4 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated approximately 47 percent of the foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance with respect to our fixed maturity

investments by segment the following tables summarize the composition of aig investments by reportable segment data table removed at both march 31 2013 and december 31 2012 approximately 88 percent and 12 percent of investments were held by domestic and foreign entities respectively aig property casualty in our property casualty business the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than that for other lines as differentiated from the life insurance and retirement services companies the focus is not on asset liability matching but on preservation of capital and growth of surplus fixed maturity securities of aig property casualty domestic operations with an average duration of 4 3 years are currently comprised primarily of tax exempt securities which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds government and agency bonds and corporate bonds the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings 137 item 2 investments fixed maturity securities held in aig property casualty foreign operations are of high quality and short to intermediate duration averaging 4 4 years while invested assets backing reserves are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities in aig property casualty domestic operations a modest portion of surplus is allocated to alternative investments including private equity and hedge funds these investments have provided a combination of added diversification and attractive long term returns over time aig life and retirement with respect to aig life and retirement we use asset liability management as a tool to determine the composition of the invested assets our objective is to maintain a matched asset liability structure although we may occasionally determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position to the extent that we have maintained a matched asset liability structure the economic effect of interest rate fluctuations is partially mitigated our investment strategy for aig life and retirement is to produce cash flows greater than maturing insurance liabilities there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities aig life and retirement frequently reviews its interest rate assumptions and actively manages the crediting rates used for its new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a low interest rate environment the investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity a number of guaranteed benefits such as living benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits are offered on certain variable and indexed annuity products the fair value of these benefits is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts we manage our exposure resulting from these long term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments we actively review underlying assumptions of policyholder behavior and persistency related to these guarantees we have taken positions in certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the impact of changes in equity markets and interest rates on these benefit guarantees we execute listed futures and options contracts on equity indexes to hedge certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuity products we also enter into various types of futures and options contracts primarily to hedge changes in value of certain guarantees of variable and indexed annuities due to fluctuations in interest rates we use several instruments to hedge interest rate exposure including listed futures on government securities listed options on government securities and the purchase of government securities with respect to over the counter derivatives we deal with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts we have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically we generally use isda master agreements and credit support annexes csas with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures fixed maturity securities of aig life and retirement with an average duration of 6 4 years are comprised of taxable corporate bonds as well as municipal and government bonds commercial mortgage loans and agency and non agency structured securities the majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on our composite ratings naic designations the svo

for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related we generally prospectively accrete into earnings the difference between the new amortized cost and the expected undiscounted recovery value over the remaining life of the security the accretion that was recognized for these securities in earnings was 205 million and 218 million for the three month periods ended

recoverables collateral extended to counterparties mostly pursuant to derivative transactions derivatives and captive fronting risk management programs for these financial institutions european concentrations we actively monitor our european credit exposures especially those exposures to issuers in the euro zone periphery we use various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine the need for mitigating actions as a mitigating action we typically decide not to renew maturing exposures or when the opportunity presents itself to sell or to tender securities to date we have not actively used credit default protection we periodically evaluate the financial condition of issuers and adjust internal risk ratings as warranted the result of these continuing reviews has led us to believe that our combined credit risk exposures in the euro zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers 152 item 2 enterprise risk management the following table presents our aggregate united kingdom and european credit exposures excluding ilfc by major sector data table

country or jurisdiction in which an aig business unit taking the risk is domiciled these cross border exposures include both aggregated cross border credit exposures to unrelated third parties and cross border investments in our own international subsidiaries five countries had cross border exposures in excess of 10 percent of total equity at both march 31 2013 and december 31 2012 based on our internal risk ratings at march 31 2013 three countries were rated aaa and two were rated aa the two largest cross border exposures were to the united kingdom and bermuda we regularly review concentration reports in the categories listed above as well as credit trends by risk ratings and credit spreads we periodically adjust limits and review exposures for risk mitigation to provide reasonable assurance that we do not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that our credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units market risk management market risk is defined as the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies equity and commodity prices and their levels of volatility market risk includes credit spread risk the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in credit spreads of securities or counterparties we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance businesses and gcm in our insurance operations market risk results primarily from potential mismatches in our asset liability exposures rather than speculative positioning specifically our life insurance and retirement businesses collect premiums or deposits from policyholders and invest the proceeds in predominantly long term fixed maturity securities we earn a spread between the asset yield and the cost payable to policyholders we manage the business so that the cash flows from invested assets are sufficient to meet policyholder obligations when they become due without the need to sell assets prematurely into a potentially distressed market in periods of severe market volatility depressed and illiquid fair values on otherwise performing investments diminish shareholders equity even without actual credit event related losses 155 item 2 enterprise risk management our market exposures can be categorized as follows benchmark interest rates benchmark interest rates are also known as risk free interest rates and are associated with either the government treasury yield curve or the swap curve the fair value of our significant fixed maturity securities portfolio changes as benchmark interest rates change credit spread or risk premium credit spread risk is the potential for loss due to a change in an instrument risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration default free instrument equity and alternative investment prices we are exposed to equity and alternative investment prices affecting a variety of instruments these include direct investments in common stock and mutual funds minimum benefit guarantees embedded in the structure of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance products and other equity like investments such as hedge funds and private equity funds private equity investments commercial real estate and real estate funds foreign currency exchange rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income assets and liabilities denominated in and significant capital deployed in a variety of currencies we use a number of measures and approaches to measure and quantify our market risk exposure including duration key rate duration duration is the measure of the sensitivities of a fixed income instrument to the changes in the benchmark yield curve key rate duration measures sensitivities to the movement at a given term point on the yield curve scenario analysis scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forward looking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 10 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world wide equity markets stress testing stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of rmbs or cmbs during 2008 var value at risk var is a summary statistical measure that uses the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors and a management determined level of confidence to estimate how frequently a portfolio of risk exposures could be expected to lose at least a specified amount insurance operations portfolio sensitivities the following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed exposures to yield curve movements include fixed maturity securities loans finance receivables and short term investments but exclude consolidated separate account assets total yield sensitive assets decreased 1 4 percent or 156 item 2 enterprise risk management approximately 4 3 billion compared to december 31 2012 primarily due to a net decrease in fixed income securities and other fixed assets of 2 7 billion and a decrease in cash equivalents of 1 6 billion exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stock preferred stocks mutual funds hedge funds private equity funds commercial real estate and real estate funds but exclude consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds total exposure in these areas decreased 0 7 percent or approximately 202 million compared to december 31 2012 primarily due to a decrease of 80 million related to decreases in partnership investments a decrease in common equity securities of 70 million and a decrease in other equity investments of 65 million these decreases were partially offset by an increase in real estate investments of 11 million exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect our consolidated non u s dollar net capital investments on a gaap basis foreign currency exchange rates net exposure increased 7 1 percent or 651 million compared to december 31 2012 this was primarily due to an increase in hong kong dollar exposure of 562 million as a result of aig life and retirement investment in picc and an increase in hong kong dollar exposure of 143 million due to the increase in market value of aig property casualty investment in picc property and casualty company limited for illustrative purposes we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u s dollar this should not be taken as a prediction but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short term cash collateral or other financial obligations the failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in reduced operating flexibility increased costs and reputational harm because liquidity is critically important our liquidity governance includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address both aig specific broader industry and market related liquidity events sources of liquidity risk can include but are not limited to financial market movements significant changes in interest rates can provide incentives for policyholders to surrender their policies changes in markets can impact collateral posting requirements or limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs due to unfavorable market conditions inadequate market depth or other investors seeking to sell the same or similar assets potential reputational events or credit downgrade changes can have an impact on policyholder cancellations and withdrawals or impact collateral posting requirements and catastrophic events including natural and man made disasters that can increase policyholder claims the principal objective of erm liquidity risk framework is to protect aig liquidity position and identify a diversity of funding sources available to meet actual and contingent liabilities during both normal and stress periods we defined our risk appetite to include a liquidity target aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a two year time horizon designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions if we project that we will breach the tolerance we will assess and determine the appropriate liquidity management actions however the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements additionally each business unit is responsible for managing liquidity within a framework designed for the measurement and monitoring of liquidity risks inherent to the business current cash and liquidity positions are reviewed for changes and against minimum liquidity levels future cash inflows and outflows are tracked through cash flow forecasting if the business unit projects a breach of the minimum liquidity levels the amount of required liquidity resources will be identified and we will determine any actions to be taken business unit level key indicators are assessed to provide advance warning of potential liquidity risks 157 table of contents item 2 critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment the accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions which are critical accounting estimates are related to the determination of classification of ilfc as held for sale insurance liabilities including property casualty and mortgage guaranty unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts income tax assets and liabilities including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset recoverability of assets including reinsurance assets estimated gross profits for investment oriented products impairment charges including other than temporary impairments of financial instruments and goodwill impairments liabilities for legal contingencies and fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities see note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters that may be highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected the following discussion updates critical accounting estimates included in the 2012 annual report for a complete discussion of aig critical accounting estimates you should read this section in conjunction with part ii item 7 md and a critical accounting estimates in the 2012 annual report classification of ilfc as held for sale we report a business as held for sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business and is committed to a formal plan the business is available for immediate sale the business is being actively marketed the sale is anticipated to occur during the next 12 months which may require significant judgment and certain other specified criteria are met a business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell if the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value a loss is recognized on december 9 2012 we entered into a definitive agreement with jumbo acquisition limited for the sale of 80 1 percent of the common stock of ilfc for approximately 4 23 billion in cash jumbo acquisition limited may elect to purchase an additional 9 9 percent of the common stock of ilfc for 522 5 million the option within ten days after approval of the ilfc transaction and the option by the committee on foreign investment in the united states the transaction is subject to required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions we determined ilfc met the criteria at december 31 2012 for held for sale accounting and consequently we recorded a 4 4 billion after tax loss for the year ended december 31 2012 which was reported in income loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations in 2012 158 item 2 critical accounting estimates recoverability of net deferred tax asset the evaluation of the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed we consider a number of factors in order to reliably estimate future taxable income so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses nols foreign tax credits ftcs and nonlife capital loss carryforwards these factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and aig specific conditions and events we also subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization we also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies our income forecasts coupled with our tax planning strategies and stress scenarios all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the tax attributes other than life insurance business capital loss

accounting estimates developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment we classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation including contractual terms prices and rates yield curves credit curves measures of volatility prepayment rates default rates mortality rates and correlations of such inputs the following paragraphs describe the methods we use to measure fair value on a recurring basis for super senior credit default swaps classified in level 3 see note 6 to the consolidated

dodd frank in the united states regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future the financial stability board fsb consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the g20 nations has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies particularly sifis should be regulated these frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision capital and solvency standards systemic economic risk corporate governance including compensation and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis the fsb has directed the international association of insurance supervisors the iais headquartered in basel switzerland to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body insurance core principles icps iais icps form the baseline threshold against which countries financial services regulatory efforts in the insurance sector are measured that measurement is made by periodic financial sector assessment program fsap reviews conducted by the world bank and the international monetary fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country specific additional or amended regulatory changes lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the financial services agency in japan financial and banking regulation adopted in france and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in germany and the united kingdom financial services authority the fsb has also charged the iais with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups the iais has requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine which elements of the insurance sector if any could materially and adversely impact other parts of the global financial services sector e g commercial and investment banking securities trading etc ultimately the iais will recommend its final assessment template to the fsb to determine whether any insurer groups should be designated as globally systemically important insurers g siis the current timetable indicates preliminary designations to be announced by june 2013 aig could be preliminarily designated a g sii and if a final designation is made aig could be then be subject to enhanced supervisory efforts which could include enhanced capital requirements under the current timetable insurer groups would expect to be definitively designated g siis in 2017 and would then be subject to such enhanced capital requirements currently termed high loss absorbance capital requirements in 2019 the iais is developing a comframe a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups iaigs which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its icps but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of iaigs as currently delineated under the comframe aig meets the parameters set forth to define an iaig while we currently do not know when any comframe directives will be finalized and become effective the iais will undertake a field testing of the comframe including the possibility of additional capital requirements for iaigs which is expected to commence in the latter part of 2013 it is expected that the comframe would be fully implemented by 2018 legislation in the european union could also affect our international insurance operations the solvency ii directive 2009 138 eec solvency ii which was adopted on november 25 2009 and is expected to become effective in january 2016 reforms the insurance industry solvency framework including minimum capital and solvency requirements governance requirements risk management and public reporting standards the impact on us will
