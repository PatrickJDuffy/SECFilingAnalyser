form 10 k in the opinion of management these consolidated financial statements contain the normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results presented herein aig evaluated the need to disclose events that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment aig considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of insurance liabilities including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts recoverability of assets including deferred policy acquisition costs dac and flight equipment estimated gross profits for investment oriented products the allowance for finance receivable losses impairment charges including other than temporary

differs from the assumptions used aig consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows would be materially affected out of period adjustments for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2010 aig recorded out of period adjustments relating to prior periods that increased net loss attributable to aig by 151 million and 279 million respectively primarily related to the effect of recording impairments on certain consolidated investments held in the institutional asset management operations which affected the calculation of income taxes and a foreign currency adjustment while these adjustments were noteworthy for the periods after evaluating the quantitative and qualitative aspects of 11 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited these corrections aig concluded that its prior period financial statements were not materially misstated and therefore no restatement was required had these and all previously reported out of period adjustments been recorded in their appropriate periods net loss attributable to aig for the year ended december 31 2009 would have increased by 644 million from 10 9 billion to 11 6 billion going concern considerations in the audited financial statements included in the 2009 annual report on form 10 k management disclosed the conditions and

twelve months liquidity of parent and subsidiaries aig manages liquidity at both the parent and subsidiary levels aig parent has not had access to its traditional sources of financing through the public debt markets since september 2008 aig is currently evaluating its ability to re access the capital markets historically aig depended on dividends distributions and other payments from subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations in light of aig current financial situation certain of its regulated subsidiaries are restricted from making dividend payments or advancing funds to aig as a result aig has also been dependent on the federal reserve bank of new york frbny credit facility the frbny credit facility provided by the frbny under the credit agreement dated as of

periods approximately 3 billion in metlife securities will be held in escrow to support indemnity claims if any which will wind down over a 30 month period unless otherwise agreed with the frbny net cash proceeds from the monetization of these securities will be used to reduce the liquidation preference of the preferred interests owned by the frbny in alico holdings and thereafter to repay any outstanding debt under the frbny credit facility other sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 aig entered into an agreement to sell its 97 57 percent share of nan shan life insurance company ltd nan shan for approximately 2 15 billion in the second quarter of 2010 aig entered into an agreement with the nan shan purchasers whereby on the closing of the sale of nan shan the purchasers will deposit 325 million of the 2 15 billion purchase price into an escrow account for possible use by nan shan if its risk based capital ratio falls below 200 percent during the four year period after the closing of the sale any amount left in escrow at the end of the four year period will be released to aig dispositions of certain businesses will be subject to regulatory approval unless a waiver is obtained from the frbny net proceeds from these dispositions after taking into account taxes and transaction expenses to the extent such proceeds do not represent capital of aig insurance subsidiaries required for

prepayments 13 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited from september 2008 through july 28 2010 aig entered into agreements to sell or completed the sale of operations and assets that generated or are expected to generate approximately 23 1 billion in aggregate net proceeds including the metlife securities discussed above of this amount 17 3 billion in aggregate net proceeds represents amounts not yet collected on various transactions the largest of which are the alico and nan shan transactions referred to above unless a waiver is obtained from the frbny net proceeds collected or monetized in the case of the metlife securities by aig are generally required to be applied toward the repayment of the frbny credit facility as mandatory prepayments except for net cash proceeds on the alico sale which would first be used to reduce the liquidation preference of the preferred interests owned by the frbny in alico holdings which was approximately 9 2 billion including accrued return as of june 30 2010 and thereafter to repay any outstanding debt under the frbny credit facility through july 28 2010 1 4 billion has been paid to the frbny under the frbny credit facility as mandatory prepayments aig has also made payments of approximately 3 6 billion to the frbny that could be determined to be mandatory prepayments in the future proceeds from sales of assets of aig financial products corp and aig trading group inc collectively aigfp are excluded from these amounts because the frbny waived the requirement that the proceeds from these specific sales be applied as mandatory prepayments gains and losses recorded in connection with the dispositions of businesses include estimates that are subject to subsequent adjustment based on the transactions closed to date aig does not believe that such adjustments will be material to future consolidated results of operations or cash flows aia transaction as of march 1 2010 aig and aia aurora llc a special purpose vehicle formed by aig aia holdings entered into a definitive agreement the aia share purchase agreement with prudential plc prudential and prudential group limited formerly known as petrohue uk investments limited for the sale of aia group limited aia to prudential group limited for approximately 35 5 billion on june 1 2010 prudential proposed revised terms to acquire aia aig board of directors declined the proposal on june 2 2010 aig and prudential terminated the transaction as a result aig concluded that it is no longer probable that it will close a sale of aia within twelve months accordingly aia is no longer being presented as held for sale or as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements see note 2 herein for discussion of segment reporting presentation in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement prudential paid aig a termination fee of 228 million which was included in net loss gain on sale of divested businesses in the consolidated statement of income loss in july 2010 aig announced plans to conduct an initial public offering of aia by seeking a listing of aia on the hong kong stock exchange subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions management assessment and conclusion in assessing aig current financial position and developing operating plans for the future management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potential financial and liquidity effects of aig risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the commitment of the frbny and the department of the treasury to the orderly restructuring of aig and their commitment to continuing to work with aig to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due the potential adverse effects on aig businesses that could result if there are further downgrades by rating agencies including in particular the uncertainty of estimates relating to the derivative transactions of aigfp such as estimates of both the number of counterparties who may elect to terminate under 14 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited contractual termination provisions and the amount that would be required to be paid in the event of a downgrade the potential for declines in bond and equity markets pending sales of significant subsidiaries or the potential for delays in asset dispositions and reduction in the anticipated proceeds therefrom the potential effect on aig if the capital levels of its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support current business plans the effect on aig businesses of continued compliance with the covenants of the frbny credit agreement and other agreements with the frbny and the department of the treasury aig highly leveraged capital structure the effect of the provisions of the troubled asset relief program tarp standards for compensation and corporate governance and the determination memoranda issued by the office of the special master for tarp executive compensation with respect to aig compensation practices and structures on aig ability to retain and motivate key employees or hire new employees the potential that loss of key personnel could reduce the value of aig business and impair its ability to stabilize businesses and effect a successful asset disposition plan and the potential for regulatory actions in one or more countries including possible actions resulting from the execution of management plans for stabilization of aig and repayment of aig obligations as they come due based on the u s government continuing commitment the already completed transactions with the frbny management plans and progress made to stabilize aig businesses and dispose of certain assets and after consideration of the risks and uncertainties of such plans management believes that it will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate aig businesses execute its asset disposition plan and repay its obligations for at least the next twelve months it is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of management plans could be materially different or that one or more of management significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect or that the transactions with the frbny discussed above fail to achieve the desired objectives if one or more of these possible outcomes is realized and third party financing is not available aig may need additional u s government support to meet its obligations as they come due under these adverse assumptions without additional support from the u s government in the future there could exist substantial doubt about aig ability to continue as a going concern in connection with making the going concern assessment and conclusion management and the board of directors of aig confirmed in connection with the filing in february 2010 of the 2009 annual report on form 10 k that as first stated by the u s treasury and the federal reserve in connection with the announcement of the aig restructuring plan on march 2 2009 the u s government remains committed to continuing to work with aig to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due aig consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or relating to the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should aig be unable to continue as a going concern 15 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited accounting policies transfers of financial assets securities purchased sold under agreements to resell repurchase at contract value securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase other than those entered into by aigfp generally are accounted for as collateralized borrowing or lending transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts plus accrued interest aigfp carries such agreements at fair value based on market observable interest rates and credit spreads aig policy is to take possession of or obtain a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell when aig does not obtain cash collateral sufficient to fund substantially all of the cost of purchasing identical replacement securities during the term of the contract generally less than 90 percent of the security value aig accounts for the transaction as a sale of the security and reports the obligation to repurchase the security as a derivative contract where securities are carried in the available for sale category aig records a gain or loss in income where changes in fair value of securities are recognized through income no additional gain or loss is recognized the fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was 2 6 billion and 2 3 billion at june 30 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively and the related cash collateral obtained was 1 9 billion and 1 5 billion at june 30 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively aig minimizes the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with aig when necessary securities lending invested collateral at fair value and securities lending payable in 2008 aig exited the domestic securities lending program and during the first quarter of 2010 aig exited its foreign securities lending activities recent accounting standards accounting changes aig adopted the following accounting standards during the first six months of 2010 accounting for transfers of financial assets in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard addressing transfers of financial assets that removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe from the fasb accounting standards codification and removes the exception that exempted transferors from applying the consolidation rules to qspes the new standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning on january 1 2010 for aig earlier application was prohibited the adoption of this standard increased both assets and liabilities by approximately 1 3 billion as a result of consolidating two previously unconsolidated qspes the adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on aig consolidated results of operations or cash flows consolidation of variable interest entities in june 2009 the fasb issued an accounting standard that amends the rules addressing consolidation of certain variable interest entities with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly affect the entity economic performance and has 1 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or 2 the right to receive benefits from the entity the new standard also requires enhanced financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 16 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited the following table summarizes the two methods applied by aig and the amount and classification in the consolidated balance sheet of the assets and liabilities consolidated as a result of the adoption of the new standard on january 1 2010 data table removed the cumulative

previously unconsolidated vies as a result of the adoption of the new standard on january 1 2010 data table removed 17 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited in february 2010 the fasb also issued an update to the aforementioned accounting standard that defers the revised consolidation rules for variable interest entities with attributes of or similar to an investment company or money market fund the primary effect of this deferral for aig is that aig will continue to apply the consolidation rules in effect before the amended guidance discussed above for its interests in eligible entities such as certain mutual funds future application of accounting standards accounting for embedded credit derivatives in march 2010 the fasb issued an accounting standard that amends the accounting for embedded credit derivative features in structured securities that redistribute credit risk in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another the new standard clarifies how to determine whether embedded credit derivative features including those in collateralized debt obligations cdos credit linked notes clns synthetic cdos and clns and other synthetic securities e g commercial and residential mortgage backed securities issued by securitization entities that wrote credit derivatives are considered to be embedded derivatives that require bifurcation and separate accounting the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on july 1 2010 for aig upon adoption aig will account for its investments in synthetic securities otherwise requiring bifurcation at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings aig expects that adoption of this standard will result in a reclassification of 306 million of synthetic securities from bonds available for sale to bond trading securities and will also result in a reclassification of 64 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to accumulated deficit as of july 1 2010 aig does not expect the adoption of this new standard to be material to its consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows consolidation of investments in separate accounts in april 2010 the fasb issued an accounting standard that clarifies that an insurance company should not combine any investments held in separate account interests with its interest in the same investment held in its general account when assessing the investment for consolidation separate accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who bear the investment risk the standard also provides guidance on how an insurer should consolidate an investment fund in situations in which the insurer concludes that consolidation of an investment is required and the insurer interest is through its general account in addition to any separate accounts the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on january 1 2011 for aig earlier application is permitted aig does not expect the adoption of this new standard to be material to its consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 2 segment information aig reports the results of its operations through four reportable segments general insurance domestic life

agreement to sell alico for approximately 15 5 billion also in the fourth quarter of 2009 aig entered into an agreement to sell its 97 57 percent share of nan shan for approximately 2 15 billion in the second quarter of 2010 aig entered into a 325 million escrow agreement with the nan shan purchasers whereby on the closing of the sale of nan shan the purchasers will deposit 325 million of the 2 15 billion purchase price into an escrow account for possible use by nan shan if its risk based capital ratio falls below 200 percent during the four year period after the closing of the sale any amount left in escrow at the end of the four year period will be released to aig accordingly aig is accounting for the escrow agreement as contingent sales consideration which will be recorded in income upon the release of such amount to aig if any this agreement contributed to an additional loss accrual related to the sale of nan shan of 294 million in the second quarter of 2010 which is reflected in loss on sale in the table below on june 21 2010 aig and the buyers agreed to extend the agreement to sell deadline to purchase nan shan to october 12 2010 to allow more time for regulatory approval aig expects the alico and nan shan sales to close during the fourth quarter of 2010 and accordingly the results of operations for these companies are presented as discontinued operations in aig consolidated statement of income loss for all periods presented and the aggregated assets and liabilities are presented separately as single line items in the asset and liability

foreign life insurance and retirement services reportable segment in the first quarter of 2010 aig entered into an agreement to sell aia and at march 31 2010 and for the three months then ended aig presented aia as held for sale and as a discontinued operation as a result of aig agreement with the buyer to terminate the agreement aig has concluded that it is no longer probable that it will close a sale of aia within 12 months accordingly aia is no longer being presented as held for sale or as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements see notes 1 and 2 herein for further discussion 21 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited in the 2009 annual report on form 10 k nan shan was presented as a discontinued operation in accordance with the terms of the frbny credit facility net proceeds from dispositions after taking into account taxes and transaction expenses to the extent such proceeds do not represent capital of aig insurance subsidiaries required for regulatory or ratings purposes are contractually required to be applied toward the repayment of the frbny credit facility as mandatory prepayments unless otherwise agreed with the frbny as a result of restructuring activities with respect to nan shan immediate parent in the second quarter of 2010 the net proceeds from the expected sale of nan shan will no longer be required for rating or regulatory purposes with respect to aig insurance company subsidiaries therefore it is now anticipated that a mandatory prepayment from net proceeds will be required upon closing the mandatory prepayment will reduce the amount available to be borrowed under the frbny credit facility by approximately the same amount as the prepayment in conjunction with this anticipated prepayment an allocation to interest expense of 82 million for the six month period ended june 30 2010 including periodic amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset was included in income loss from discontinued operations the interest expense allocation to discontinued operations shown in the table below was based on the estimated funds of 1 825 billion committed to repay the frbny credit facility multiplied by the daily interest rate for each respective period the periodic amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset allocated to discontinued operations was determined based on the ratio of funds committed to repay the frbny credit facility to the total outstanding available amount under the frbny credit facility

measurements fair value measurements on a recurring basis aig measures the following financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis trading and available for sale securities portfolios certain mortgage and other loans receivable derivative assets and liabilities securities purchased sold under agreements to resell repurchase non traded equity investments and certain private limited partnerships and certain hedge funds included in other invested assets certain short term investments separate and variable account assets certain policyholder contract deposits securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased certain trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors certain long term debt and certain hybrid financial instruments included in other liabilities the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing able and knowledgeable market participants at the measurement date the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value conversely financial instruments traded in other than active markets or those that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment an active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis an other than active market is one in which there are few transactions the prices are not current price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers or in which little information is released publicly for the asset or liability being valued pricing observability is affected by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions fair value hierarchy assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three levels based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair values as discussed below level 1 fair value measurements that are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that aig has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities market price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer markets aig does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 include certain government and agency securities actively traded listed common stocks and derivative contracts most separate account assets and most mutual funds 26 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited level 2 fair value measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 generally include certain government and agency securities most investment grade and high yield corporate bonds certain residential mortgage backed securities rmbs commercial

purchased sold under agreements to resell repurchase mutual fund and hedge fund investments certain derivative contracts guaranteed investment agreements gias and cpff at aigfp other long term debt and physical commodities level 3 fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that use significant inputs that are unobservable these measurements include circumstances in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety aig assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment in making the assessment aig considers factors specific to the asset or liability assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 include certain rmbs cmbs and cdo abs corporate debt certain municipal and sovereign debt certain derivative contracts including aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio policyholder contract deposits carried at fair value private equity and real estate fund investments and direct private equity investments aig non financial instrument assets that are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis generally are classified as level 3 the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments carried at fair value these methodologies are applied to assets and liabilities across the levels noted above and it is the observability of the inputs used that determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for the respective asset or liability valuation methodologies incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements aig own credit risk fair value measurements for aigfp debt gias structured note liabilities and freestanding derivatives incorporate aig own credit risk by determining the explicit cost for each counterparty to protect against its net credit exposure to aig at the balance sheet date by reference to observable aig credit default swap or cash bond spreads a counterparty net credit exposure to aig is determined based on master netting agreements when applicable which take into consideration all positions with aig as well as collateral posted by aig with the counterparty at the balance sheet date fair value measurements for embedded policy derivatives and policyholder contract deposits take into consideration that policyholder liabilities are senior in priority to general creditors of aig and therefore are much less sensitive to changes in aig credit default swap or cash issuance spreads counterparty credit risk fair value measurements for freestanding derivatives incorporate counterparty credit by determining the explicit cost for aig to protect against its net credit exposure to each counterparty at the balance sheet date by reference to observable counterparty credit default swap spreads when available when not available other directly or indirectly observable credit spreads are used to derive the best estimates of the counterparty spreads aig net credit exposure to a counterparty is determined based on master netting agreements which take into consideration all derivative positions with the counterparty as well as collateral posted by the counterparty at the balance sheet date 27 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited a cds is a derivative contract that allows the transfer of third party credit risk from one party to the other the buyer of the cds pays an upfront and or annual premium to the seller the seller payment obligation is triggered by the occurrence of a credit event under a specified reference security and is determined by the loss on that specified reference security the present value of the amount of the annual and or upfront premium therefore represents a market based expectation of the likelihood that the specified reference party will fail to perform on the reference obligation a key market observable indicator of non performance risk the cds spread fair values for fixed maturity securities based on observable market prices for identical or similar instruments implicitly incorporate counterparty credit risk fair values for fixed maturity securities based on internal models incorporate counterparty credit risk by using discount rates that take into consideration cash issuance spreads for similar instruments or other observable information the cost of credit protection is determined under a discounted present value approach considering the market levels for single name cds spreads for each specific counterparty the mid market value of the net exposure reflecting the amount of protection required and the weighted average life of the net exposure cds spreads are provided to aig by an independent third party aig utilizes an interest rate based on the benchmark london interbank offered rate libor curve to derive its discount rates while this approach does not explicitly consider all potential future behavior of the derivative transactions or potential future changes in valuation inputs aig believes this approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities including consideration of the impact of non performance risk fixed maturity securities trading and available for sale aig maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair

sale portfolios market price data is generally obtained from dealer markets management is responsible for the determination of the value of the investments carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions aig employs independent third party valuation service providers to gather analyze and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments when aig valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote which is generally non binding or by employing widely accepted internal valuation models valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and through the use of widely accepted internal valuation models provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of service agreements the inputs used by the valuation service providers include but are not limited to market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities benchmark yields interest rate yield curves credit spreads currency rates and other market observable information as applicable the valuation models take into account among other things market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term interest rate credit rating industry sector and when applicable collateral quality and other security or issuer specific information when market transactions or other market observable data is limited the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased aig has processes designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value aig assesses the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers through various analytical techniques in addition aig may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained 28 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited from aig valuation service providers to other third party valuation sources for selected securities aig also validates prices for selected securities obtained from brokers through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions the methodology above is relevant for all fixed maturity securities following are discussions of certain procedures unique to specific classes of securities fixed maturity securities issued by government entities for most debt securities issued by government entities aig obtains fair value information from independent third party valuation service providers as quoted prices are generally only available for limited debt securities issued by government entities the fair values received from these valuation service providers may be based on a market approach using matrix pricing which considers a security relationship to other securities for which a quoted price in an active market may be available or alternatively based on an income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows to a single present value amount fixed maturity securities issued by corporate entities for most debt securities issued by corporate entities aig obtains fair value information from third party valuation service providers for certain corporate debt instruments for example private placements that are not traded in active markets or that are subject to transfer

lane iii at their inception ml ii and ml iii were valued and recorded at the transaction prices of 1 billion and 5 billion respectively subsequently the maiden lane interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the maiden lane assets aig applies model determined market discount rates to its interests these discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with aig interests in the capital structure of the respective entities estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated to the extent possible using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools structure and terms the fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in the maiden lane interests will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets underlying the maiden lane interests other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts

investments after repayment of the first priority obligations owed to the frbny aig cash flow methodology considers the capital structure of the collateral securities and their expected credit losses from the underlying asset pools the fair values of the maiden lane interests are most affected by changes in the discount rates and changes in the underlying estimated future collateral cash flow assumptions used in the valuation model the libor interest rate curve changes are determined based on observable prices interpolated or extrapolated to derive a libor for a specific maturity term as necessary the spreads over libor for the maiden lane interests including collateral specific credit and liquidity spreads can change as a result of changes in market expectations about the future performance of these investments as well as changes in the risk premium that market participants would demand at the time of the transactions changes in estimated future cash flows would primarily be the result of changes in expectations for defaults recoveries and prepayments on underlying loans changes in the discount rate or the estimated future cash flows used in the valuation would alter aig estimate of the fair value of the maiden lane interests as shown in the table below data table removed aig believes that the ranges of discount rates used in these analyses are reasonable based on implied spread volatilities of similar collateral securities and implied volatilities of libor interest rates the ranges of estimated future cash flows were determined based on variability in estimated future cash flows implied by cumulative loss estimates for similar instruments because of these factors the fair values of the maiden lane interests are likely to vary perhaps materially from the amount estimated equity securities traded in active markets trading and available for sale aig maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when

market prices and rates yield curves credit curves measures of volatility prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets such as generic forwards swaps and options model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means and model selection does not involve significant management judgment certain otc derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult when aig does not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions the transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value accordingly when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equals the transaction price subsequent to initial recognition aig updates valuation inputs when

various factors such as liquidity bid offer spreads and credit considerations such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence management best estimate is used embedded policy derivatives the fair value of embedded policy derivatives contained in certain variable annuity and equity indexed annuity and life contracts is measured based on actuarial and

or loans using internal valuation models third party price estimates and market indices the principal market was determined to be the market in which super senior credit default swaps of this type and size would be transacted or have been transacted with the greatest volume or level of activity aig has determined that the principal market participants therefore would consist of other large financial institutions who participate in sophisticated over the counter derivatives markets the specific valuation methodologies vary based on the nature of the referenced obligations and availability of market prices the valuation of the super senior credit derivatives is challenging given the limitation on the availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in the structured finance market these market conditions have increased the reliance on management estimates and judgments in arriving at an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes further disparities in the valuation methodologies employed by market participants and the varying judgments reached by such participants when assessing volatile markets have increased the likelihood that the various parties to these instruments may arrive at significantly different estimates as to their fair values 32 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited aigfp valuation methodologies for the super senior credit default swap portfolio have evolved over time in response to market conditions and the availability of market observable information aig has sought to calibrate the methodologies to available market information and to review the assumptions of the methodologies on a regular basis regulatory capital portfolio in the case of credit default swaps written to facilitate regulatory capital relief aigfp estimates the fair value of these derivatives by considering observable market transactions the transactions with the most observability are the early terminations of these transactions by counterparties aigfp continues to reassess the expected maturity of the portfolio aigfp has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties the regulatory benefit of these transactions for aigfp financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision basel i that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards issued by the basel committee on banking supervision basel ii it was expected that financial institution counterparties would have transitioned from basel i to basel ii by the end of the two year adoption period on december 31 2009 after which they would have received little or no additional regulatory benefit from these cds transactions except in a small number of specific instances however the basel committee announced that it had agreed to keep in place the basel i capital floors beyond the end of 2009 although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various european central banking districts should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame in assessing the fair value of the regulatory capital cds transactions aigfp also considers other market data to the extent relevant and available for further discussion see note 8 herein multi sector cdo portfolios aigfp uses a modified version of the binomial expansion technique bet model to value its credit default swap portfolio written on super senior tranches of multi sector collateralized debt obligations cdos of abs including maturity shortening puts that allow the holders of the securities issued by certain cdos to treat the securities as short term 2a 7 eligible investments under the investment company act of 1940 2a 7 puts the bet model was developed in 1996 by a major rating agency to generate expected loss estimates for cdo tranches and derive a credit rating for those tranches and remains widely used aigfp has adapted the bet model to estimate the price of the super senior risk layer or tranche of the cdo aig modified the bet model to imply default probabilities from market prices for the underlying securities and not from rating agency assumptions to generate the estimate the model uses the price estimates for the securities comprising the portfolio of a cdo as an input and converts those estimates to credit spreads over current libor based interest rates these credit spreads are used to determine implied probabilities of default and expected losses on the underlying securities this data is then aggregated and used to estimate the expected cash flows of the super senior tranche of the cdo prices for the individual securities held by a cdo are obtained in most cases from the cdo collateral managers to the extent available cdo collateral managers provided market prices for 63 2 percent of the underlying securities used in the valuation at june 30 2010 when a price for an individual security is not provided by a cdo collateral manager aigfp derives the price through a pricing matrix using prices from cdo collateral managers for similar securities matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the relationship of the security to other benchmark quoted securities substantially all of the cdo collateral managers who provided prices used dealer prices for all or part of the underlying securities in some cases supplemented by third party pricing services the bet model also uses diversity scores weighted average lives recovery rates and discount rates aigfp employs a monte carlo simulation to assist in quantifying the effect on the valuation of the cdo of the unique aspects of the cdo structure such as triggers that divert cash flows to the most senior part of the capital 33 table of contents american international

addition to calculating an estimate of the fair value of the super senior cdo security referenced in the credit default swaps using its internal model aigfp also considers the price estimates for the super senior cdo securities provided by third parties including counterparties to these transactions to validate the results of the model and to determine the best available estimate of fair value in determining the fair value of the super senior cdo security referenced in the credit default swaps aigfp uses a consistent process which considers all available pricing data points and eliminates the use of outlying data points when pricing data points are within a reasonable range an averaging technique is applied corporate debt collateralized loan obligation clo portfolios in the case of credit default swaps written on portfolios of investment grade corporate debt aigfp uses a mathematical model that produces results that are closely aligned with prices received from third parties this methodology is widely used by other market participants and uses the current market credit spreads of the names in the portfolios along with the base correlations implied by the current market prices of comparable tranches of the relevant market traded credit indices as inputs one transaction representing one percent of the total notional amount of the corporate arbitrage transactions is valued using third party quotes given its unique attributes aigfp estimates the fair value of its obligations resulting from credit default swaps written on clos to be equivalent to the par value less the current market value of the referenced obligation accordingly the value is determined by obtaining third party quotes on the underlying super senior tranches referenced under the credit default swap contract policyholder contract deposits policyholder contract deposits accounted for at fair value are measured using an earnings approach by taking into consideration the following factors current policyholder account values and related surrender charges the present value of estimated future cash inflows policy fees and outflows benefits and maintenance expenses associated with the product using risk neutral valuations incorporating expectations about policyholder behavior market returns and other factors and a risk margin that market participants would require for a market return and

liabilities and hybrid financial instruments where performance is linked to structured interest rates inflation or currency risks using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above given the nature of the embedded risk profile such instruments are classified in level 2 or level 3 depending on the observability of significant inputs to the model in addition adjustments are made

debt certain municipal bonds related to affordable housing partnerships and investment partnerships the transfers into level 3 related to investments in abs rmbs and cmbs were due to a decrease in market transparency and downward credit migration in these securities transfers into level 3 for private placement corporate debt were primarily the result of aig overriding third party matrix pricing information downward to better reflect the additional risk premium associated with those securities that aig believes was not captured in the matrix certain municipal bonds were transferred into level 3 based on limited market activity for the particular issuances and related limitations on observable inputs for their valuation investment partnerships transferred into level 3 were primarily comprised of certain hedge funds with limited market activity due to fund imposed redemption restrictions assets are transferred out of level 3 when circumstances change such that significant inputs can be corroborated with market observable data this may be due to a significant increase in market activity for the asset a specific event one or more significant input s becoming observable or when a long term interest rate significant to a valuation becomes short term and thus observable during the three and six month periods ended june 30 2010 aig transferred approximately 2 0 billion and 3 0 billion respectively of assets out of level 3 these transfers out of level 3 are primarily related to investments in private placement corporate debt as well as investments in certain abs and rmbs and

quote that appropriately reflects the fair value of those securities without the need for adjustment based on aig own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or the current liquidity in the market transfers out of level 3 for rmbs investments were primarily due to increased usage of pricing from valuation service providers that were reflective of market activity where previously an internally adjusted price had been used certain investment partnerships were transferred out of level 3 primarily due to the availability of information related to the underlying assets of these funds during the three and six month periods ended june 30 2010 aig transferred into level 3 approximately 33 million and 807 million of liabilities respectively primarily related to term

security prior to recovery the standard also changes the threshold for determining when an other than temporary impairment has occurred on a fixed maturity security with respect to intent and ability to hold the security until recovery and requires additional disclosures a credit impairment which is recognized in earnings when it occurs is the difference between the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security and the estimated present value of cash flows expected to be collected recovery value as determined by management the difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not

following criteria the security has traded at a significant 25 percent or more discount to cost for an extended period of time nine consecutive months or longer a discrete credit event has occurred resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised

substantially lower than par value of their claims or aig has concluded that it may not realize a full recovery on its investment regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events the determination that an equity security is other than temporarily impaired requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer its near term prospects and

relationships and terms nature of the vie operations and purpose nature of the vie interests issued and aig involvements with the entity aig also evaluates the design of the vie and the related risks the entity was designed to expose the variable interest holders to in evaluating consolidation for vies with attributes consistent with that of an investment company or a money market fund the primary beneficiary is the party or group of related parties that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the vie receives the majority of the expected residual returns of the vie or both for all other variable interest entities the primary beneficiary is the entity that has both 1 the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly affect the entity economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the vie while also considering these factors the consolidation conclusion depends on the breadth of aig decision making ability and its ability to influence activities that significantly affect the economic performance of the vie exposure to loss aig total off balance sheet exposure associated with vies primarily consisting of financial guarantees and commitments to real estate and investment funds was 1 6 billion and 2 2 billion at june 30 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively 54 table of

arising from its transactions in most cases aigfp did not hedge its exposures related to the credit default swaps it had written as a dealer aigfp structured and entered into derivative transactions to meet the needs of counterparties who may be seeking to hedge certain aspects of such counterparties operations or obtain a desired financial exposure aigfp derivative transactions involving interest rate swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts aigfp typically became a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and therefore is exposed to counterparty credit risk and may be exposed to loss if counterparties default currency commodity and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps but involve the exchange of specific currencies or cash flows based on the underlying commodity equity securities or indices also they may involve the exchange of notional amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction aigfp follows a policy of minimizing interest rate currency commodity and equity risks associated with investment securities by entering into offsetting positions on a security by security basis within its derivatives portfolio thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation and depreciation in addition to reduce its credit risk aigfp has entered into credit derivative transactions with respect to 455 million of securities to economically hedge its credit risk the timing and the amount of cash flows relating to aigfp foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements futures and forward contracts are contracts that obligate the holder to sell or purchase foreign currencies commodities or financial indices in which the seller purchaser agrees to make take delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument at a specified price or yield options are contracts that allow the holder of the option to purchase or sell the underlying commodity currency or index at a specified price and within or at a specified period of time as a writer of options aigfp generally receives an option premium and then manages the risk of any unfavorable change in the value of the underlying commodity currency or index by entering into offsetting transactions with third party market participants risks arise as a result of movements in current market prices from contracted prices and the potential inability of the counterparties to meet their obligations under the contracts aigfp super senior credit default swaps aigfp entered into credit default swap transactions with the intention of earning revenue on credit exposure in the majority of aigfp credit default swap transactions aigfp sold credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities generally aigfp provides such credit protection on a second loss basis meaning that aigfp would incur credit losses only after a shortfall of principal and or interest or other credit events in respect of the protected loans and debt securities exceeds a specified threshold amount or level of first losses typically the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities has been tranched into different layers of risk which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies at origination there is usually an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio and then successive layers ranging generally from a bbb rated layer to one or more aaa rated layers a significant majority of aigfp transactions that were rated by rating agencies had risk layers or tranches rated aaa at origination and are immediately junior to the threshold level above which aigfp payment obligation would generally arise in transactions that were not rated aigfp applied equivalent risk criteria for setting the threshold level for its payment obligations therefore the risk layer assumed by aigfp 60 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited with respect to the designated portfolio of loans or debt securities in these transactions is often called the super senior risk layer defined as a layer of credit risk senior to one or more risk layers rated aaa by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated structured to the equivalent thereto the following table presents the

sector cdo arbitrage portfolio and 4 8 years for the corporate debt clo portfolio regulatory capital portfolio the regulatory capital portfolio represents derivatives written for financial institutions in europe for the purpose of providing regulatory capital relief rather than for arbitrage purposes in exchange for a periodic fee the counterparties receive credit protection with respect to a portfolio of diversified loans they own thus reducing their minimum capital requirements these cds transactions were structured with early termination rights for counterparties allowing them to terminate these transactions at no cost to aigfp at a certain period of time or upon a regulatory event such as the implementation of basel ii during the six month period ended june 30 2010 59 8 billion in net notional amount was terminated or matured at no cost to aigfp through july 30 2010 aigfp had also received termination notices for an additional 1 8 billion in net notional amount with effective termination dates in 2010 the regulatory capital relief cds transactions require cash settlement and other than for collateral posting aigfp is required to make a payment in connection with a regulatory capital relief transaction only if realized credit losses in respect of the underlying portfolio exceed aigfp attachment point all of the regulatory capital transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution or its affiliates receiving the credit protection rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties in the vast majority of transactions the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the cds either directly or through an intermediary the super senior tranches of these cds transactions continue to be supported by high levels of subordination which in most instances have increased since origination the weighted average subordination supporting the prime residential mortgage and corporate loan referenced portfolios at june 30 2010 was 12 82 percent and 15 32 percent respectively the highest realized losses to date in any single residential mortgage and corporate loan pool were 2 56 percent and 0 52 percent respectively the corporate loan transactions are each comprised of several hundred secured and unsecured loans diversified by industry and in some instances by country and have per issuer concentration limits both types of transactions generally allow some substitution and replenishment of loans subject to defined constraints as older loans mature or are prepaid these replenishment rights generally expire within the first few years of the trade after which the proceeds of any prepaid or maturing loans are applied first to the super senior tranche sequentially thereby increasing the relative level of subordination supporting the balance of aigfp super senior cds exposure given the current performance of the underlying portfolios the level of subordination and aigfp own assessment of the credit quality of the underlying portfolio as well as the risk mitigants inherent in the transaction structures aigfp does not expect that it will be required to make payments pursuant to the contractual terms of those transactions providing regulatory relief aigfp continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio as of june 30 2010 aigfp estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 2 34 years aigfp has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties the regulatory benefit of these transactions for aigfp financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of basel i that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by basel ii it was expected that financial institution counterparties would have transitioned from basel i to basel ii by the end of the two year adoption period on december 31 2009 after which they would 62 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited have received little or no additional regulatory benefit from these cds transactions except in a small number of specific instances however in 2009 the basel committee announced that it had agreed to keep in place the basel i capital floors beyond the end of 2009 although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various european central banking districts should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions

unsecured corporate obligations that were generally rated investment grade at inception of the cds these cds transactions require cash settlement also included in this portfolio are cds transactions with a net notional amount of 1 3 billion written on the senior part of the capital structure of clos which require physical settlement certain of the super senior credit default swaps provide the counterparties with an additional termination right if aig rating level falls to bbb or baa2 at that level counterparties to the cds transactions with a net notional amount of 10 1 billion at june 30 2010 have the right to terminate the transactions early if counterparties exercise this right the contracts provide for the counterparties to be compensated for the cost to replace the transactions or an amount reasonably determined in good faith to estimate the losses the counterparties would incur as a result of the termination of the transactions due to long term maturities of the cds in the arbitrage portfolio aig is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made however the net notional amount represents the maximum exposure to loss on the super senior credit default swap portfolio collateral most of aigfp super senior credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions which typically are governed by international swaps and derivatives association inc isda master agreements master agreements and related credit support annexes csa these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes aigfp has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps of which a large majority relate to multi sector cdos to a lesser extent aigfp has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage the amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of aig credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor while a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined given the severe market disruption lack of observable data and the uncertainty of future market price movements aigfp is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future at june 30 2010 and december 31 2009 the amounts of collateral postings with respect to aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions were 4 0 billion and 4 6 billion

june 30 2010 aigfp had posted 269 million of collateral under these contracts non aigfp derivatives aig and its subsidiaries other than aigfp also use derivatives and other instruments as part of their financial risk management programs interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps are used to manage interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed income securities outstanding medium and long term notes and other interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in addition foreign exchange derivatives principally foreign exchange forwards and options are used to economically mitigate risk associated with non u s dollar denominated debt net capital exposures and foreign exchange transactions the derivatives are effective economic hedges of the exposures they are meant to

provide for collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels at june 30 2010 29 7 million of collateral was posted for cds contracts related to the mip the notional amount represents the maximum exposure to loss on the written cds contracts however due to the average investment grade rating and expected default recovery rates actual losses are expected to be less 65 table of contents

downgrade of aig long term senior debt ratings to baa1 by moody investors service moody and bbb by standard and poor financial services llc a subsidiary of the mcgraw hill companies inc s and p would permit counterparties to make additional collateral calls and permit the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts resulting in up to approximately 1 7 billion of corresponding collateral postings and termination payments a two notch downgrade to baa2 by moody and bbb by s and p would result in approximately 1 3 billion in additional collateral postings and termination payments above the one notch downgrade amount and a three notch downgrade to baa3 by moody and bbb by s and p would result in approximately 0 2 billion in additional collateral postings and termination payments above the two notch downgrade amount additional collateral postings upon downgrade are estimated based on the factors in the individual collateral posting provisions of the csa with each counterparty and current exposure as of june 30 2010 factors considered in estimating the termination payments upon downgrade include current market conditions the complexity of the derivative transactions historical termination experience and other observable market events such as bankruptcy and downgrade events that have occurred at other companies the actual termination payments could significantly differ from management estimates given market conditions at the time of downgrade and the level of uncertainty in estimating both the number of counterparties who may elect to exercise their right to terminate and the payment that may be triggered in connection with any such exercise 9 commitments contingencies and guarantees in the normal course of business various commitments and contingent

suppression for misrepresenting and or concealing the nature and extent of coverage the complaints filed by the plaintiffs and the intervenor plaintiffs request compensatory damages for the 1999 class in the amount of 3 2 billion plus punitive damages aig and its subsidiaries deny the allegations of fraud and suppression and have asserted that information concerning the excess policy was publicly disclosed months prior to the approval of the settlement aig and its subsidiaries further assert that the current claims are barred by the statute of limitations and that plaintiffs assertions that the statute was tolled cannot stand against the public disclosure of the excess coverage the plaintiffs and intervenor plaintiffs in turn have asserted that the disclosure was insufficient to inform them of the nature of the coverage and did not start the running of the statute of limitations on december 1 2008 the intervenor plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in intervention that purports to bring claims against all defendants for deceit and conspiracy to deceive and a claim against aig and its subsidiaries for aiding and abetting caremark alleged deception the defendants have moved to

effect of stop loss limits on certain second lien policies a net gain on sales of divested businesses of 198 million in the second quarter of 2010 reflecting 228 million of income related to the termination of the aia sale transaction compared to losses of 566 million in the same period in 2009 and a decline in other than temporary impairment charges on available for sale securities of 210

are adequate to cover estimated losses attributable to this event however aig claims estimates may change over time as the forensic investigation is incomplete the cleanup is incomplete and the litigation has only just begun there may also be other policyholders involved as the matter evolves the types of claims may include but not be limited to cleanup costs both directly incurred and those for which reimbursement to the government may be required natural resource damages including damages to the various fisheries impacted by the spill property damage to private property business interruption to gulf coast businesses the bodily injury and wrongful death claims of the workers on the rig claims for the destruction of the rig itself and various class actions brought by gulf coast

the frbny has been considering whether prior payments made by aig to repay the frbny credit facility from asset sales should be treated as mandatory prepayments that reduce the amount available under the frbny credit facility if the frbny takes this position at june 30 2010 this would reduce the amount available to be borrowed under the frbny credit facility by approximately 3 6 billion such reduction in the frbny credit facility would trigger accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of approximately 600 million significant events in 2010 alico sale as of march 7 2010

holdings to metlife and the sale of delaware american life insurance company by aig to metlife for approximately 15 5 billion consisting of 6 8 billion in cash and the remainder in equity securities of metlife subject to closing adjustments the cash portion of the proceeds from this sale will be paid to the frbny to reduce the liquidation preference of a portion of the preferred interests owned by the frbny in alico holdings together with the preferred interests owned by the frbny in aia holdings the preferred interests upon the closing of this sale to metlife alico holdings will receive and pay to the frbny the cash consideration and will hold the remainder of the transaction consideration consisting of 78 239 712 shares of metlife common stock 6 857 000 shares of newly issued participating preferred stock convertible into 68 570 000 shares of common stock upon the approval of metlife shareholders and 40 000 000 equity units of metlife with an aggregate stated value of 3

will be held in escrow to support indemnity claims which will wind down over a 30 month period unless otherwise agreed with the frbny net cash proceeds from the monetization of these securities will be used to reduce the liquidation preference of the preferred interests owned by the frbny in alico holdings and thereafter to repay any outstanding debt under the frbny credit facility 102 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries retained financial interest in the case of the sale of alico the value of the securities consideration is subject to fluctuation from the date of signing of the alico stock purchase agreement through closing of sale and the ultimate monetization by aig of the metlife securities these fluctuations will be influenced by market prices of metlife securities generally and the market prices of metlife common stock in particular which will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of aig including the business and financial performance of metlife aig is subject in each case to agreed upon minimum holding periods that also restrict aig ability to enter into hedging transactions that might protect aig against fluctuations in the value of the securities consideration these minimum holding periods and hedging restrictions cannot be altered without the consent of metlife so aig will bear the risk of these market price fluctuations during the applicable holding periods the amount of any gain or loss recognized by aig upon each sale will depend upon the fair value of the securities consideration received as of closing and the proceeds received by aig from the monetization of the securities this may also result in aig realizing ultimate cash proceeds from the monetization of the securities consideration that is substantially less than what might be expected from the value of such consideration as of the date of signing of the purchase agreement during the holding period aig will carry these securities as available for sale investments with changes in the fair value of the securities recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss aia transaction on june 1 2010 prudential

expenses the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies as well as by policy retention rates cash provided by general insurance operations was 729 million for the first six months of 2010 compared to 652 million in the same period in 2009 as a reduction in claims paid was partially offset by declines in premiums collected arising primarily from a decrease in domestic production

through february 28 2011 at the current time aig believes that any further extension of such support will not be necessary aig is continuing to explore strategic alternatives for agf including a potential sale of all or a majority of its 2 4 billion investment in agf depending on the amount of proceeds to be realized on a potential sale aig may incur a loss which could be material to its consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period debt maturities for the matched investment program mip are expected to be funded through cash flows generated from invested assets as well as the sale or financing of the asset portfolios in the program however mismatches in the timing of cash flows of the mip as well as any shortfalls due to impairments of mip assets would need to be funded by aig parent in addition as a result of aig restructuring activities aig expects to utilize assets from its noncore businesses and subsidiaries to provide future cash flow enhancement and assist the mip in meeting its maturing debt obligations approximately 603 million of aigfp debt maturities through june 30 2011 are fully collateralized with assets backing the corresponding liabilities however mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities depending on market conditions and aigfp ability to sell assets at that time proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities any shortfalls would need to be funded by aig parent aig expects to meet its debt maturities primarily through borrowings under the frbny credit facility and dividends distributions and other payments from subsidiaries the department of the treasury commitment is primarily used for capital support of subsidiaries in the future aig may need to provide additional capital support for its subsidiaries aig has developed certain plans some of which have already been implemented to provide stability to its businesses and to provide for the timely repayment of the frbny credit facility in addition certain of aig outstanding financial derivative transactions could require collateral calls or termination payments based on a downgrade in aig credit rating see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements sales of other businesses from september 2008 through july 28 2010 aig entered into agreements to sell or completed the sale of operations and assets that generated or are expected to generate approximately 23 1 billion in aggregate net proceeds including the metlife securities discussed above of this amount 17 3 billion in aggregate net proceeds represents amounts not yet collected on various transactions the largest of which are the alico referred to above and nan shan transactions unless a waiver is obtained from the frbny net proceeds collected or monetized in the case of the metlife securities by aig are generally required to be applied toward the repayment of the frbny credit facility as mandatory prepayments except for net cash proceeds on the alico sale which would first be used to reduce the liquidation preference of the preferred interests owned by the frbny in alico holdings which was approximately 9 2 billion including accrued return as of june 30 2010 108 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries and thereafter to repay any outstanding debt under the frbny credit facility through july 28 2010 1 4 billion has been paid to the frbny under the frbny credit facility as mandatory prepayments aig has also made payments of approximately 3 6 billion to the frbny that could be determined to be mandatory prepayments in the future proceeds from sales of assets of aig financial products corp and aig trading group inc collectively aigfp are excluded from these amounts because the frbny waived the requirement that the proceeds from these specific sales be applied as mandatory prepayments gains and losses recorded in connection with the dispositions of businesses include estimates that are subject to subsequent adjustment based on the transactions

aig has also been dependent on the frbny as a primary source of liquidity and on the department of the treasury commitment to support the capital needs of aig insurance company subsidiaries in the

of operations investments for further information domestic and foreign life insurance and retirement services operations the most significant potential liquidity needs of aig domestic and foreign life insurance and retirement services companies are the funding of surrenders and withdrawals a substantial increase in these needs could place stress on the liquidity of these companies however management considers the sources of liquidity for domestic and foreign life insurance and retirement services subsidiaries adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs these subsidiaries generally have been lengthening their maturity profile by purchasing investment grade fixed income securities in order to reduce the high levels of liquidity which had been maintained during 2009 given the size and liquidity profile of aig domestic and foreign life insurance and retirement services investment portfolios aig believes that deviations from their projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk a significant increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals which could be triggered by a variety of factors including aig specific concerns could result in a substantial liquidity strain other potential events causing a liquidity strain could include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to domestic and foreign life insurance and retirement services operations nationalization catastrophic terrorist acts pandemics or other economic or political upheaval aig believes that its domestic and foreign life insurance and retirement services companies

need to contribute capital to these companies financial services aig major financial services operating subsidiaries consist of ilfc aigfp agf and aig consumer finance group inc aigcfg certain traditional sources of funds to meet the short term liquidity needs of these operations are generally no longer available these sources included issuance of commercial paper and bank credit facilities

subject to the satisfaction of certain collateralization milestones 110 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries in addition as mentioned above ilfc agreed to sell 61 aircraft to third parties these sales are expected to generate approximately 2 2 billion in gross proceeds during 2010 most of the sales of the individual aircraft are expected to be consummated during the remainder of 2010 and the related proceeds are receivable upon the completion of each individual sale as part of its ongoing fleet strategy ilfc may pursue additional potential aircraft sales and debt issuances ilfc management is balancing the need for funds with the long term value of holding aircraft and other financing alternatives because the current market for aircraft is depressed due to the economic downturn and limited availability of buyer financing it is likely that if additional aircraft are sold to meet liquidity needs realized losses may be incurred in the first six months of 2010 ilfc recorded asset impairment charges aggregating 387 million and operating lease related losses of 90 million on aircraft under contract to be sold aig expects that ilfc existing cash balances future cash flows from operations potential debt issuances and aircraft sales will be sufficient for ilfc to meet its existing obligations for at least the next twelve months

mitigation options monitoring metrics and certain implications of various potential outcomes each plan has been reviewed by a steering committee whose membership includes senior executives of aig the plans are subject to change as efforts progress and as conditions in the financial markets evolve and they contemplate depending on the book in question alternative strategies including sales assignments or other transfers of positions terminations of positions and or run offs of positions in accordance with existing terms execution of these plans is overseen by a transaction approval process involving senior members of aigfp and aig respective management groups as specific actions entail greater liquidity and financial consequences successful execution of these plans is subject to varying degrees depending on the transactions of a given book to market conditions and in many circumstances counterparty negotiation and agreement in connection with the wind down certain assets were

early 2011 that the remaining aigfp derivatives portfolio will consist of transactions that aig believes will be of low complexity or of low risk or not economically feasible to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis during the latter stages of the wind down aig expects to assume direct management of the investments and debt obligations of aigfp at which time the performance of those assets and liabilities will no longer be reported as part of capital markets however aig anticipates that the remaining derivatives business will continue to be reported as capital markets the cost of executing the wind down will depend on many factors many of which are not within aig control including market conditions aigfp access to markets via market counterparties the availability of liquidity

expenses including the change in deferred acquisition costs aig along with most property and casualty insurance companies uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance the loss ratio is the sum of claims and claims adjustment expenses divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is underwriting expenses divided by net premiums earned these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the cost of claims and expenses respectively a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates an underwriting profit and over 100 indicates an underwriting loss net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity regulation product

review are currently reflected in pre tax income because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve

years aig conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence such additional analyses were conducted for each class of business as appropriate in the three month period ended june 30 2010 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for three month

see general insurance results herein for further discussion of net loss development asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2009 annual report on form 10 k aig reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground up analysis in the six month period ended june 30 2010 a minor amount of adverse incurred loss

american international group inc and subsidiaries survival ratios asbestos and environmental the following table presents aig survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at june 30 2010 and 2009 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the june 30 2010 gross asbestos survival ratio is lower than the ratio at june 30 2009 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments in addition aig survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007 these settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at june 30 2010 by approximately 0 3 years and 0 7 years respectively and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at june 30 2009 by approximately 1 0 years and 2 1 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aig determination of its reserves is not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio the following table presents aig survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined which

hypothetical business combination an impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess in connection with the announced sale of alico on march 7 2010 and management decision that alico met the held for sale criteria on march 31 2010 total goodwill of 4 6 billion associated with the foreign life insurance and retirement services japan operating segment through that date was allocated among alico and the japan businesses to be retained retained reporting unit based on their relative fair values as of march 31 2010 this resulted in 3 3 billion and 1 3 billion of goodwill being allocated to alico and the retained reporting unit respectively for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairment management tested goodwill for impairment in both reporting units and determined the fair values of alico and the retained reporting unit exceeded book value at march 31 2010 by 1 percent and 51 percent respectively and therefore the goodwill of these reporting units was considered not impaired the fair value of alico used to test goodwill for impairment at march 31 2010 was determined by aig by considering among other information a third party valuation at march 31 2010 of the announced proceeds from the sale of alico to metlife given the significance of the equity component of the consideration the fair value of alico is sensitive to the market value and volatility of metlife common stock the risk free interest rate yield curve and discount rate assumptions used in estimating fair value because the market value of metlife common stock declined 13 percent at june 30 2010 compared with march 31 2010 aig updated its goodwill impairment test for alico at june 30 2010 aig estimated the fair value of alico and determined the fair value of alico to be less than its carrying value accordingly aig performed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis and estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill allocated to alico by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of alico over the amounts that would be assigned to alico assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination based on the results of the goodwill impairment test aig determined that all of the goodwill allocated to alico should be impaired and accordingly recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 3 3 billion in the second quarter of 2010 there were no events that warranted an update of the fair value of the retained reporting unit at june 30 2010 as a result of earnings the book value of the japan businesses to be retained increased to 4 8 billion at june 30 2010 such that the march 31 2010 fair value of the retained reporting unit exceeded its june 30 2010 book value by 30 percent aig will continue to monitor overall competitive business and economic conditions and other events or circumstances including the operating results and level of net assets of the japan operating segment that more likely than not could reduce the fair value of the japan operating segment below its carrying amount it is possible that such future conditions or events might result in an impairment of a portion or all of the 1 2 billion of goodwill remaining in the japan operating segment in the future valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at june 30 2010 and december 31 2009 aig had a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of 5 5 billion and 5 9 billion respectively a valuation allowance is established if necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized a likelihood of more than 50 percent realization of aig net deferred tax asset depends upon its ability to generate gains on asset sales including from the divestitures of aia and alico and tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to 167 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset but does not depend on projected future operating income for aig u s consolidated income tax group when making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax asset at june 30 2010 aig considered all available evidence including the nature frequency and severity of cumulative financial reporting losses certain transactions including the recognition of the gains on asset sales and the planned divestitures of aia and alico the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards and tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset estimates of future gains generated from specific transactions and tax planning strategies could change in the near term perhaps materially which may require aig to adjust its valuation allowance such adjustment either positive or negative could be material to aig consolidated financial condition or its results of operations for an individual reporting period when estimating the fair values of the subsidiaries to be divested aig considered among other information valuations prepared for various purposes during the first quarter of 2010 aig increased its estimate of the aia and alico expected divestiture proceeds following an updated assessment of the range of valuation estimates that considered among other factors the expected proceeds from the sales to prudential plc and metlife inc announced in that quarter which gave rise to the 910 million reduction in the valuation allowance as discussed in note 1 herein on june 2 2010 aig and prudential plc terminated the aia transaction because aig is continuing with its plans to divest aia this termination did not affect the amount of deferred tax asset expected to be realized in connection with the planned divestiture of aia this determination was based on an updated assessment of the expected gain and considered a range of possible outcomes associated with alternative divestiture strategies including an initial public offering u s income taxes on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries due to the complexity of the u s federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes related to differences between book carrying value and tax basis of subsidiaries as well as the level of judgment and reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability aig considers the u s federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate measurement of the fair values of the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of fuji on march 31 2010 aig through a chartis international subsidiary purchased additional voting shares in fuji the acquisition of the additional voting shares for 145 million increased chartis total voting ownership interest in fuji from 41 7 percent to 54 8 percent which resulted in chartis obtaining control of fuji because the acquisition was completed on the last day of the quarter the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete when aig issued its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended march 31 2010 the initial purchase price allocation was based on the information that was available at the time to identify and estimate certain of the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of fuji as of the acquisition date fuji financial information is reported to chartis on a quarter lag as such chartis was awaiting additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date furthermore at the time chartis had not obtained final appraisals of fuji insurance contracts loans certain real estate or intangible assets during the quarter ended june 30 2010 chartis completed the accounting for the acquisition and retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts initially recorded chartis obtained the additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date including final appraisals of fuji insurance contracts loans certain real

information becomes known about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the amounts recognized as of that date the acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately 406 million which is included in other income in the consolidated statement of income loss aig will retrospectively revise its results of operations for the three months ended march 31 2010 when presenting comparative financial information containing that period the bargain purchase gain is primarily attributable to the depressed market value of fuji common stock which aig believes is the result of macro economic capital market and regulatory factors in japan coupled with fuji financial condition and results of operations aig anticipates that the bargain purchase gain will not be subject to u s or foreign income tax because the gain would only be recognized for tax purposes upon the sale of the fuji shares see note 4 to the consolidated

liabilities respectively measured at fair value on a recurring basis as level 3 this represented 4 6 percent and 1 9 percent of the total assets and liabilities respectively at december 31 2009 level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable these measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability aig assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment 169 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries in making the assessment aig considers factors specific to the asset or liability in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of transfers of level 3 assets and liabilities valuation of level 3 assets and liabilities aig values its assets and liabilities classified as level 3 using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices and rates yield curves credit curves measures of volatility prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs some of which may be unobservable the following paragraphs describe the methods aig uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified in level 3 private equity and real estate fund investments these assets initially are valued at the transaction price i e the price paid to acquire the asset subsequently they are measured based on net asset value using

interests in the maiden lane interests at their inception ml ii and ml iii were valued at the transaction prices of 1 billion and 5 billion respectively subsequently maiden lane interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the assets to which the maiden lane interests are entitled and the discount rates applicable to such interests as derived from the fair value of the entire asset pool the implicit discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with aig interests in the capital structure of the respective entities estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated to the extent possible using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools structure and terms the fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in the maiden lane interests will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets of the maiden lane interests other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts reported refer to note 5 for sensitivity analysis disclosures with respect to the maiden lane interests 170 table

notional amount with an effective termination date in 2010 aigfp continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio as of june 30 2010 aigfp estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 2 34 years aigfp has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties the regulatory benefit of these transactions for aigfp financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of basel i that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by basel ii it was expected that financial institution counterparties would have transitioned from basel i to basel ii by the end of the two year adoption period on december 31 2009 after which they would have received little or no additional regulatory benefit from these cds transactions except in a small number of specific instances however in 2009 the basel committee announced that it had agreed to keep in place the basel i capital floors beyond the end of 2009 although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various european central banking districts should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame the weighted average expected maturity of the regulatory capital portfolio increased as of june 30 2010 by approximately one year from december 31 2009 due to certain counterparties not terminating transactions with a combined net notional amount of 18 3 billion where these counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early aigfp has extended the expected maturity dates by one year which is based on how long aigfp believes the basel i extension will be effective where the counterparties no longer have the right to terminate early aigfp has used the weighted average life of those transactions as their expected maturity these counterparties in the corporate loan and prime residential mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits as a result of the extension of the basel i capital floor announced by the basel committee on banking supervision and thus aig continues to categorize them as regulatory capital transactions included in the regulatory capital portfolio are transactions with one counterparty that notified aig that it would not terminate early two of its prime residential mortgage transactions and a related mezzanine transaction with a combined net notional amount of 25 3 billion that were expected to be terminated in the first quarter of 2010 with respect to these transactions the counterparty no longer has any rights to terminate the transactions early and is required to pay aig fees on the original notional amounts reduced only by realized losses through the final contractual maturity since the two transactions have weighted average lives that are considerably less than their final contractual maturities there is value to aigfp representing counterparty contractual fees to be received beyond the date at which the net notional amounts have fully amortized through to the final contractual maturity date the fair value of these two super senior transactions as of june 30 2010 was a derivative asset of 163 million with respect to these two transactions aigfp has also written cds transactions on the mezzanine tranches of these portfolios however the majority of the transactions on the mezzanine tranches were hedged by aigfp with other third party cds transactions the fair value of the net derivative liability for all mezzanine tranches including hedge transactions increased from 143 million as of december 31 2009 to 191 million as of june 30 2010 for more information on aigfp collateral calls see collateral calls below in light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data to the extent deemed relevant and available aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the six month period ended june 30 2010 other than 1 for transactions where aigfp believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above and 2 for transactions where the counterparty has failed to terminate the transaction early as expected and no longer has any rights to terminate early in the future although aigfp believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties the counterparties early termination rights and aigfp expectation that such rights will be exercised preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions 173 table of contents american international group inc

regulatory capital cds transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution or its affiliates receiving the credit protection rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties in the vast majority of transactions the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the cds either directly or through an intermediary as further discussed below aigfp receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets aigfp also obtains other information such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer the nature of the information provided or otherwise available to aigfp with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital cds transaction is not consistent across all transactions furthermore in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions the pools are blind meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to aigfp in addition although aigfp receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools virtually all of the regulatory capital cds transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude aigfp public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets the originating financial institutions calculation agents or trustees each a report provider provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below including for those within the blind pools while much of this information received by aigfp cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information it does provide a sufficient basis for aigfp to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value for regulatory capital cds transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans aigfp receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more report

such credit event ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available but aigfp estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the report providers to rating agency criteria the percent non investment grade information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the cds transactions which is determined by the individual transaction structures for example small and medium enterprise sme loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large well established enterprises however the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the sme loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools in addition the transaction structures reflect aigfp assessment of the loan collateral arrangements expected recovery values and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss the percentage of non investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably the two pools containing the highest percentages of non investment grade obligations which include all transactions with pools having non investment grade percentages greater than 40 00 percent are all granular sme loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions the average number of loans in each pool is over 4 500 this large number of sme loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool these transactions benefit from a tranche junior to it which was still rated aaa by at least two rating agencies at june 30 2010 three other pools with a total net notional amount of 1 9 billion have non investment grade percentages greater than 35 00 percent each with a remaining life to maturity of 15 7 years these pools have realized losses of 0 16

posting provisions these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes although aigfp has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi sector cdos regulatory capital relief transactions as of june 30 2010 53 6 percent of aigfp regulatory capital relief transactions measured by net notional amount were subject to credit support annexes csa linked to aig credit rating and 46 4 percent of the

derivatives association inc isda master agreement master agreement or similar agreement under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction the underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty and there is no standard formula the varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties the following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio reference to market indicesunder this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index such as either itraxx or cdx this mechanism is used for cds transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages while the market index is not a direct proxy it has the advantage of being readily obtainable 181 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries expected loss modelsunder this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses generally determined using a rating agency model negotiated amountunder this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between aigfp and the counterparty which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by aigfp the following table presents the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio prior to consideration of transactions other than aigfp super senior credit default swaps subject to the same master agreements as of the periods ended data table removed arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos in the cds transactions with physical settlement provisions in respect of multi sector cdos the standard csa provisions for the calculation of exposure have been modified with the exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying cdo security rather than the replacement value of the transaction as of any date the market value of the relevant cdo security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such cdo security in a market transaction on such date while the replacement value of the transaction is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation e g the cdo security in cases where a formula is utilized a transaction specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of exposure which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted these thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of aig and or the reference obligations with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings for the large majority of counterparties to these transactions the master agreement and csa cover non cds transactions e g interest rate and cross currency swap transactions as well as cds transactions as a result the amount of collateral to be posted by aigfp in relation to the cds transactions will be added to or offset by the amount if any of the exposure aig has to the counterparty on the non cds transactions arbitrage portfolio corporate debt clos all of aigfp corporate arbitrage transactions are subject to csas none of these transactions measured by net notional amount contains a special collateral posting provision but each is subject to a master agreement that includes a csa these transactions are treated the same as other transactions subject to the same master agreement and csa with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard csa procedures outlined above none of these transactions although subject to a master agreement and csa has specific valuation and threshold provisions collateral calls aigfp has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps of which a large majority relate to multi sector cdos to a lesser extent aigfp has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage from time to time valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference cdo securities for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by aigfp in connection with such instruments have resulted in estimates that differ at times significantly from aigfp estimates in almost all cases aigfp has been able to 182 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements aigfp regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences including at the present time valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are like any other third party valuation considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio the following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions as of the periods ended data table removed the amount of future collateral posting requirements generally is a function of aig credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor while a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined given the severe market disruption lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption aigfp is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future valuation sensitivity arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aig calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average prices for cdos increased 0 90 percent and 1 61 percent of the notional amount outstanding for the first and second quarters of 2010 further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the total 6 8 billion net notional amount of cds written on multi sector cdos outstanding at june 30 2010 a bet value is available for 4 3 billion net notional amount no bet value is determined for 2 5 billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 4 3 billion the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities while the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a cdo the changes are subject to actual market 183 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries conditions which have proved to be highly volatile especially given current market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo

capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at aig consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities in the case of life insurance and retirement services companies as well as in the mip portfolio the fundamental investment strategy is as nearly as is practicable to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in the commercial insurance group historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in order to meet the commercial insurance group current risk return and tax objectives the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies liquidity duration and quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives fixed maturity securities held by foreign general insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities the market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components including interest rate environment credit spread embedded optionality such as call features liquidity structural complexity foreign exchange risk and other credit and non credit factors however in most circumstances pricing is most sensitive to interest rates such that the market price declines as interest rates rise and increases as interest rates fall this effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities aig accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value however with limited exceptions primarily with respect to separate account products on aig consolidated balance sheet aig does not fair value its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities and falling interest rates have the opposite effect
