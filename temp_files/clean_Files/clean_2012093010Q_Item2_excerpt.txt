businesses and the life and annuity industry in general continue to be affected by the current low interest rate environment low interest rates can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of dac continued low interest rates also put pressure on long term investment returns negatively affect future sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits loss recognition certain long duration products including traditional life insurance accident and health products such as long term care insurance and payout annuities may require increases in reserves if changes in estimates 88 table of contents of future investment returns result in projected future losses long term care products may also require additional reserve if future expected premium increases are not sufficient to cover future benefit cost increases not provided for in the current reserves for these long duration traditional products the assumptions used to calculate benefit liabilities and dac are locked in

estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing dac is adjusted and additional policyholder benefit liabilities may be recorded through a charge to policyholder benefit expense aig life and retirement does not expect a dac unlocking or an increase in reserves due to loss recognition in 2012 solely as a result of the low interest rate environment in conjunction with a program to utilize capital loss tax carryforwards aig life and retirement sold approximately 14 7 billion of investments in the first nine months of 2012 these sales and other sales and subsequent reinvestment at lower yields triggered loss recognition on certain long term contracts in the amount of 1 1 billion which effectively transferred shadow loss recognition from unrealized to actual loss recognition and to a much lesser extent transferred shadow dac to dac amortization expense in the first nine months of 2012 in connection with this block of business assumptions related to investment yields mortality and expenses will be reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate which may result in additional loss recognition or reserve increases in addition due to the reinvestment of the assets at lower yields earnings related to this block of business are expected to decline beginning in 2013 see results of operations segment results aig life and retirement operations equity market volatility declines in the equity markets may result in higher reserves for variable annuity guarantee features and equity market volatility can affect the recoverability and amortization rate of dac

returns for its variable annuity business given inherent changes in equity market returns and interest rates this methodology reduces the effect of short term volatility on valuations of reserves for

anticipated for 2012 solely as the result of positive market returns dac voba and sia for investment oriented products for long duration traditional business which includes traditional life accident

expects to reduce the number of its operating life insurance legal entities to three subject to receiving all necessary regulatory approvals these legal entity mergers are targeted to be effective as of december 31 2012 variable annuities aig life and retirement variable annuity sales increased due to access to broad distribution including the addition of several new distributors and aig life and retirement reinstatement by its largest pre financial crisis distribution partner as well as its innovative product offerings in addition several competitors have scaled back or ceased selling variable annuity products in 2012 as a result of a broad distribution network and a more favorable competitive environment aig life and retirement expects variable annuity sales to remain strong for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013 aig life and retirement has a dynamic hedging program designed to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities contained in certain variable annuity contracts caused by changes in the equity markets interest rates and market implied volatilities aig life and retirement substantially hedges its exposure to equity markets however due to regulatory capital considerations a portion of aig life and retirement interest rate exposure is unhedged in 2012 aig life and retirement began purchasing u s treasury bonds as a capital efficient strategy to reduce its interest rate risk exposure over time in addition aig life and retirement launched a new product offering with a volatility controlled fund which further reduces aig life and retirement risk related to market volatility while offering a competitive benefit the volatility controlled fund seeks capital appreciation and current income while managing net equity exposure by investing a portion of aig life and retirement assets using a strategy designed to reduce the effects of equity market volatility fixed annuities changes in the interest rate environment affect the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products as a result of the current low interest rate environment fixed annuity sales in the first nine months of 2012 were significantly below 2011 levels if the low interest rate environment continues aig life and retirement expects its fixed annuities sales including deposits into fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets to remain weak for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013 life insurance aig life and retirement strategic focus for mortality based products includes disciplined underwriting active expense management and product innovation aig life and retirement distribution strategy is to grow new sales by strengthening the core retail independent and career agent distributor channels and expanding its market presence with competitively priced products offering superior consumer value and differentiated features in addition aig life and retirement is enhancing its service and technology platform through the consolidation of its life operations and administrative systems which is expected to result in an improved service delivery model and a more efficient operating platform in connection with this project aig life and retirement recorded a charge of 20 million in the three months ended september 30 2012 interest crediting rates the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in aig life and retirement products may have the effect in a continued low interest rate environment of reducing aig life and retirement spreads and thus reducing future profitability although aig life and retirement partially mitigates this interest rate risk through its asset liability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability 90 table of contents as of september 30 2012 the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities consisted of intermediate and long term fixed maturity securities aig life and retirement generally purchases assets with the intent of matching expected maturities of the insurance liabilities an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability maturities from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses opportunistic investments in structured securities continue to be made in order to improve yields increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment aig life and retirement annuity and universal life products were designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees aig life and retirement has adjusted and will continue to adjust crediting rates in order to maintain targeted interest rate spreads on both new business and in force business where crediting rates are above minimum guarantees new fixed annuity sales have declined in the first nine months of 2012 relative to the same period in 2011 due to the relatively low crediting rates offered however even in the current interest rate environment aig life and retirement continues to pursue new sales of life and annuity products at targeted interest rate spreads the annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of 1 percent universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non indexed products and 1 percent on new indexed products and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted interest spreads as a result of these actions aig life and retirement estimates that the effect of interest rates remaining at or near current levels through the end of 2013 on pre tax operating income would not be material and would be modestly more significant with respect to 2014 results as indicated in the table below approximately 61 percent of aig life and retirement annuity and universal life account values are at their minimum crediting rates as of september 30 2012 an increase from 45 percent at december 31 2011 these products have minimum guaranteed interest rates as of september 30 2012 ranging from 1 0 percent to 5 5 percent with the higher rates representing guarantees on older products in addition to the products discussed above certain traditional long duration products for which aig life and retirement does not have the ability to adjust interest rates such as payout annuities are exposed to reduced earnings and potential losses in a prolonged low interest rate environment the following table presents account values by range of current minimum guaranteed interest rates and current

developments ugc believes it is a market leader in the mortgage insurance industry with a differentiated risk based pricing model producing new high quality business the withdrawal of certain competitors from the market during 2011 combined with ugc investment grade rating and differentiation strategy that ugc implemented in late 2010 and early 2011 has positioned ugc to take advantage of market opportunities ugc is continuing to execute this strategy in the first nine months of 2012 ugc increased pricing nationally by approximately 6 percent on average ugc will continue to review its new business pricing relative to changes in the market to ensure that the price of coverage is commensurate with the level of risk being underwritten delinquent inventory review beginning in the third quarter of 2011 and continuing into the third quarter of 2012 ugc requested that lenders file claims in accordance with the terms of the respective master policies on approximately 21 000 accounts that had been delinquent approximately 24 months or more and were not expected to be cured many of these delinquencies were the result of the foreclosure moratorium discussed below through september 30 2012 ugc received responses to over 90 percent of these requests while accelerating the payment of claims these requests have resulted in coverage rescissions and claim denials at levels higher than previously experienced ugc has considered these higher levels of rescissions and denials and the potential for higher levels of overturns in estimating its reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses over the remainder of 2012 and during the first half of 2013 ugc expects that reserve development and premium refunds associated with these claim requests will continue to impact the business ugc continues to monitor and review the status of these requests and plans to contact lenders on an ongoing basis regarding additional delinquencies that meet these criteria under the terms of these master policies if a claim is not submitted within a year of ugc request the lender would no longer be able to file a claim foreclosure delays since 2010 a variety of servicing practices have come to light that have delayed the foreclosure process in many states some of these practices such as the robo signing of affidavits in judicial foreclosures have resulted in government investigations into lenders foreclosure practices these developments have slowed the reporting of foreclosures which has in turn slowed the filing of mortgage insurance claims and increased the uncertainty surrounding the determination of the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses 92 table of contents ugc assumptions regarding future foreclosures on current delinquencies take into consideration this trend although significant uncertainty remains surrounding the determination of the liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses ugc expects that this trend may continue for the

impact that any resolution individually or collectively may have on its future results of operations or financial condition as discussed above ugc has requested that lenders file claims on delinquent

fees premiums decreased in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 primarily due to declines in commercial insurance resulting from enhanced risk selection and the continued execution of strategic initiatives to improve pricing and loss ratios these declines were partially offset by increases in consumer insurance resulting from the business

investment income the following table summarizes the components of consolidated net investment income data table removed includes hedge funds mutual funds private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships net investment income for the three months ended september 30 2012 was significantly higher than the same period in 2011 due to the following fair value gains on aig ml iii residual interest and its investment in aia equity securities compared to decreases in fair value of both investments for the same period in 2011 higher income on fixed maturity securities as a result of opportunistic risk weighted increases in the structured securities portfolio and higher income from alternative investments due to improved equity market performance 95 table of contents net investment income for the nine months ended september 30 2012 increased significantly from the same period of 2011 primarily due to fair value gains on aig ml iii residual interest the frbny completed

value gains on aig investment in aia equity securities increases in the fair value of maiden lane ii llc ml ii which made its final distribution in the first quarter of 2012 and higher income from fixed maturity securities and short term investments attributable to higher average invested balances in connection with the redeployment of cash in the first half of 2011 the increases were partially offset by declines in alternative investment income in the first half of 2012 due to relatively weaker equity market performance in 2012 compared to 2011 net realized capital gains losses the following table summarizes the components of consolidated net realized capital gains losses data table removed aig recognized higher net realized capital gains in the three month period ended september 30 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to higher gains from sales of fixed maturity securities due in part to a program that resulted in the utilization of capital loss tax carryforwards in the aig life and retirement operations and lower other than temporary impairments these gains were partially offset by foreign exchange losses driven by a weakening u s dollar against most foreign currencies in the third quarter of 2012 compared to strengthening of the u s dollar in the same period in 2011 aig recognized net realized capital gains in the nine month period ended september 30 2012 compared to net realized capital losses in the same period in 2011 due to the following significantly higher gains from sales of fixed maturity securities due in part to the capital

exchange losses during the nine month period ended september 30 2012 primarily due to strengthening of the u s dollar against the japanese yen 96 table of contents these gains were partially offset by derivative losses driven primarily by spread tightening and the u s dollar strengthening against foreign currencies aircraft leasing revenues and expenses aircraft leasing revenue increased slightly in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2012 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to an increase from the consolidation of aeroturbine commencing in october 2011 this increase was partially offset by the impact of early returns of aircraft from lessees who ceased operations lower lease revenue earned on re leased aircraft in its fleet and the decrease in the

valuation adjustment loss of 97 million in 2011 the slight increase in other income for the nine month period ended september 30 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 was driven by an improvement

partially offset by losses on liabilities due to the tightening of aig credit spreads net credit valuation adjustment gains of 453 million and 370 million were recognized for the nine month periods ended september 30 2012 and 2011 respectively these improvements were partially offset by lower gains on real estate dispositions and losses on real estate equity investments other expenses decreased in the three month period ended september 30 2012 due to a decrease in losses on trusts that hold leased commercial aircraft and a reduction in expense of 117 million in 2012 resulting from the

fees for the sale of aig common stock as described above policyholder benefits and claims incurred policyholder benefits and claims incurred decreased in the three and nine month periods ended

tornadoes in the second quarter of 2011 and the tohoku catastrophe in japan and earthquakes in new zealand in the first quarter of 2011 policyholder benefits and claims incurred also decreased for mortgage guaranty in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2012 due to declines in newly reported delinquencies and favorable loss development in 2012 compared to unfavorable loss development in 2011 partially offsetting these decreases were increases in policyholder benefit expenses in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2012 for aig life and retirement due to the sale of securities in unrealized gain positions that support certain payout annuity products and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields which triggered loss recognition

ended september 30 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 amortization of dac increased in the nine month period ended september 30 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to aig property casualty continued strategy to grow the higher margin consumer insurance business which carries higher acquisition costs than commercial insurance and change its mix of business within commercial insurance and consumer insurance to more profitable lines with higher acquisition costs partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in the amortization of dac in the nine month period

nine month periods ended september 30 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 due to increases in compensation expense bad debt expense direct marketing expense and expenses related to strategic

offset by changes in uncertain tax positions for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2011 the effective tax rates on pretax loss from continuing operations were 15 6 and 31 3 percent

in the estimates in the payout patterns of previously established loss reserves did not have a significant impact on the change in discount in any of the periods presented quarterly reserving process aig believes that its net loss reserves are adequate to cover net losses and loss expenses as of september 30 2012 while aig regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that aig ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed aig loss reserves as of september 30 2012 in the opinion of management such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on aig consolidated financial condition although such events could have a material adverse effect on aig consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period in determining the loss development from prior accident years aig conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years management examines the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence aig conducted reserve analyses in 2012 to determine the loss development from prior accident years as part of its reserving process aig also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues such as those related to changes in the legal regulatory judicial and social

business policies written after 1987 primary workers compensation lines and primary casualty which is included in all other net for the nine month period ended september 30 2012 the adverse development was driven by reserve increases on claims in the aig property casualty environmental business policies written after 1987 legacy environmental exposures 1986 and prior and excess casualty lines this was partially offset by net favorable development in reserves for natural catastrophes principally the tohoku catastrophe and favorable development in the consumer insurance operating segment which is included in all other net the development in the environmental business for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2012 was primarily attributable to claims increases in four major categories site liability coverage for known remediation projects and increased clean up costs fixed facility coverage for manufacturers and distributors whose raw materials products or industrial processes present a significant environmental exposure policies that provide an enhanced general liability product designed specifically to meet the needs of environmental consultants and contractors and a surety policy that provided performance bonding for the remediation and closure of a landfill site the reserve increase in the environmental business was the result of an on going review of certain cases that aig believes to be subject to the most volatility for several of those cases aig concluded that the reserves should be increased to take into account the updated assessment of the claims aig also reviewed the legacy environmental 1986 and prior claims and increased the reserves accordingly partially offsetting the prior accident year adverse development aig property casualty recognized additional premiums on loss sensitive business of 66 million and 52 million for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2012 respectively compared to 25

to the asbestos loss reserve discount is reflected in the table below in the nine month period ended september 30 2012 aig increased its gross environmental reserves by 150 million and increased its net environmental reserves by 75 million this development is primarily attributable to several large accounts which led to an increase in the estimate of claims that have been incurred but not

resolved increased substantially during 2012 as a result of aig property casualty determination that certain methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe claims presented no further potential for exposure since these underlying claims were resolved through dismissal settlement or trial for all of the accounts involved all of these accounts were fully reserved at the account level and included adequate reserves for those underlying individual claims that contributed to the actual losses these individual claim closings therefore had no impact on aig property casualty environmental reserves b represents an administrative change to the method of determining the number of open claims which had no effect on carried reserves survival ratios asbestos and environmental the following table presents aig survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at september 30 2012 and 2011 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would take before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aig determination of its reserves is not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analyses thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio the following table presents survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims which were based upon a three year average payment data table removed survival ratios are calculated consistent with the basis on historical reserve excluding the effects of the nico reinsurance transaction 119 table of contents aig life and retirement highlights the results of aig life and retirement for the three and nine

interest rates on u s treasury securities during the first nine months of 2012 the fair value of the u s treasury securities used for hedging net of financing costs increased by 48 million this was partially offset by embedded derivative losses related to the decline in interest rates which are reported in net realized gains losses pre tax income for aig life and retirement included a 621 million increase in net realized capital gains compared to the 2011 period due to higher gains from the sale of investments and lower other than temporary impairments these higher gains were partially offset by 421 million higher fair value losses on variable annuity embedded derivatives net of related hedges and other interest and currency rate swaps which were primarily due to declining credit spreads and declines in long term interest rates the sale of securities in an unrealized gain position and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds at generally lower yields triggered loss recognition for certain payout annuity products in the amount of 1 1 billion in 2012 which effectively transferred shadow loss recognition from unrealized to actual loss recognition and to a lesser extent

in both the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2012 as substantial decreases in individual fixed annuities were only partially offset by significant increases in individual variable annuities and retail mutual funds individual fixed annuity deposits declined due to the low interest rate environment as consumers are reluctant to purchase such annuities at the relatively low crediting rates currently offered group retirement product deposits which include deposits into mutual funds and fixed options within variable annuities sold in group retirement markets decreased modestly due to slightly lower levels of individual rollover deposits and periodic deposits in 2012 partially offset by higher mutual fund deposits the low interest rate environment has also begun to impact group retirement deposits resulting in lower levels of deposits into fixed options individual variable annuity deposits increased due to innovative product enhancements and expanded distribution as well as a more favorable competitive environment premiums from life insurance products increased in 2012 but were more than offset by declines in deferred annuities sold through life insurance distribution channels retail mutual fund sales growth was principally driven by sunamerica asset management corp focused dividend strategy product offering which continues as a top short and long term performer within its respective peer group aig life and retirement total life sales increased nine percent during the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due in part to the timing of large institutional product sales sales of aig life and retirement term products through its affiliated matrix direct channel in the first nine months of 2012 were up due in part

september 30 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 primarily due to lower net realized capital gains on foreign denominated debt resulting from u s dollar strengthening against the euro and the british pound and lower gains on real estate dispositions and losses on real estate equity investments partially offsetting these losses was a reduction in expense of 117 million in the three months ended september 30 2012 resulting from the decrease in the estimate of the liability for the department of the treasury underwriting fees for the sale of aig common stock as shares were sold at a

a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the frbny credit facility and the exchange of outstanding junior subordinated debentures for senior unsecured notes in 2011 partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in corporate expenses due to an increased estimated litigation liability of approximately 729 million based on developments in several actions ongoing corporate initiatives and higher compensation expense which varies in part based on aig stock price real estate and other non core businesses declined due to lower gains on real estate dispositions and higher equity losses on real estate investments 133 table of contents consolidated comprehensive income loss the following table presents aig consolidated comprehensive income loss data table removed change in unrealized appreciation of investments the increases in 2012 were primarily attributable to appreciation in bonds available for sale due to lower interest rates and narrowing spreads

rates and increased unrealized appreciation in the quarter u s treasury rates declined during the second quarter of 2012 with the ten year rate declining to a historical low during the quarter partially offsetting the u s treasury rate decline were widening spreads although the increased spreads were less than the u s treasury rate decline u s treasury rates ended the third quarter of 2012 approximately flat however spreads narrowed considerably in the quarter resulting in significant unrealized appreciation during 2011 the insurance operations portfolios experienced appreciation in bonds available for sale and increased valuations on cost method partnerships and appreciation on equities available for sale the bond appreciation was driven by lower rates with spread tightening on high yield securities more than offsetting the u s treasury rate increase during the first quarter of 2011 higher valuations on cost method partnerships also contributed to the appreciation during the first quarter of 2011 driven by positive equity market performance a combination of lower u s treasury rates and spread tightening on investment grade securities drove appreciation during the second quarter of 2011 with an additional contribution coming from appreciation in aig investment in the picc property and casualty co ltd u s treasury rates dropped significantly in the third quarter of 2011 partially offset by spreads widening the net effect was an increase in unrealized appreciation primarily in respect of government obligations and high grade fixed securities the third quarter of

month period ended september 30 2012 net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by 9 5 billion primarily resulting from the narrowing of credit spreads as of september 30 2012 the majority of aig fixed maturity investments in an unrealized loss position of more than 50 percent for 12 months or more consisted of the unrealized loss of 158 million related to cmbs and rmbs securities originally rated investment grade that are floating rate or that have low fixed coupons relative to current market yields a total of 2 securities with an amortized cost of 12 million and a net unrealized loss of 10 million are still investment grade as part of its credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities aig considers 166 the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities for most security types supported by real estate related assets current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities this is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors in addition for floating rate securities persistently low libor levels continue to make these securities less attractive aig believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral based securities low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts based on its analysis and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities aig continues to believe that the expected cash flows from these securities will be sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment aig continues to monitor these positions for potential credit impairments that could result from further deterioration in commercial and residential real estate fundamentals see also note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of aig investment

downgraded or placed under review in the recent past by one or more of the major rating agencies these downgrades occurred mostly in countries in the euro zone periphery spain italy and portugal where aig credit exposures totaled 266 million at september 30 2012 the downgrades primarily reflect large government budget deficits rising government debt to gdp ratios and large financing requirements of these sovereigns which have given rise to widening credit spreads and difficult financing conditions these credit exposures primarily included available for sale and trading securities at fair value issued by these governments aig had no direct or guaranteed credit exposure to the governments of greece or ireland aig aggregate credit exposure to the government of japan was 9 3 billion at

especially those exposures to issuers in the euro zone periphery and uses various stress assumptions to identify issuers and securities warranting review by senior management and to determine whether mitigating actions should be taken mitigating actions in these areas to date have largely included non renewal of maturing exposures and sales and tenders of securities to date aig purchases of credit default swap protection have been minimal the financial condition of issuers is periodically evaluated and internal risk ratings are adjusted as circumstances warrant the result of these continuing reviews has led aig to believe that its combined credit risk exposures to sovereign governments financial institutions and non financial corporations in the euro zone are manageable risks given the type and size of exposure and the credit quality and size of the issuers 172 aig also monitors its aggregate cross border exposures by country and regional group of countries aig includes in its cross

reasonable assurance that it does not incur excessive levels of credit risk and that aig credit risk profile is properly calibrated across business units market risk management insurance and aircraft leasing sensitivities the following table provides estimates of aig sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed exposures to yield curves include assets that are directly sensitive to yield curve movements such as fixed maturity securities loans finance receivables receivables from aircraft equipment under leases and short term investments excluding consolidated separate account assets exposures to equity and alternative investment prices include investments in common stocks preferred stocks mutual funds hedge funds private equity funds commercial real estate and real estate funds excluding consolidated separate account assets and consolidated managed partnerships and funds exposures to foreign currency exchange rates reflect aig consolidated non u s dollar net capital investments on a gaap basis total yield sensitive assets increased 1 6 percent or approximately 5 3 billion compared to december 31 2011 this was primarily due to a net increase in fixed income securities and other fixed assets of 6 3 billion partially offset by a decrease in cash equivalents of 959 million total equity and alternative investments exposure decreased 15 9 percent or approximately 6 3 billion compared to december 31 2011 this was primarily due to a decrease of 6 2 billion related to aig sale of aia equity securities as well as decreases in other common equity securities of 629 million mutual fund values of 128 million and other equity investments of 11 million the decrease was partially offset by increases in partnership values of 532 million and real estate investments of 261 million foreign currency exchange rates net exposure increased 42 4 percent or 2 5 billion compared to december 31 2011 this was primarily due to an increase in british pound exposure of 1 8 billion from changes in chartis europe foreign currency exchange hedging and investment strategy other increases include euro exposure of 443 million as a result of a reduction in euro denominated debt outstanding of 231 million an additional purchase of aire investment of 109 million positive results from operations at chartis europe sa of 103 million 173 and changes in canadian dollar denominated unearned premium reserves of 378 million this was partially offset by a net decrease across currencies of 67 million the above sensitivities of a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u s dollar were chosen solely for illustrative purposes the selection of these specific events should not be construed as a prediction but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events these scenarios should not be construed as the only risks aig faces these events are shown as an indication of several possible losses aig could experience in addition losses from these and other risks could be materially higher than illustrated the sensitivity factors are the same as those used in the 2011 annual report critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment the accounting policies that aig believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions which are critical accounting estimates are related to the determination of income tax assets and liabilities including recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset recoverability of assets including deferred policy acquisition costs flight equipment and reinsurance insurance liabilities including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts estimated gross profits for investment oriented products impairment charges including other than temporary impairments of financial instruments and goodwill impairments liabilities for legal contingencies and fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters that may be highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used aig consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected the following is a discussion of 2012 updates to critical accounting estimates included in the 2011 annual report for a complete discussion of aig critical accounting estimates see the 2011 annual report recoverability of deferred tax asset the evaluation of the recoverability of aig deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires aig to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion about aig framework for assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax asset recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs short duration aig property casualty recoverability of dac is based on the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned generally 12 months for short duration insurance contracts dac is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts for short duration insurance contracts starting on january 1 2012 aig elected to include anticipated investment income in its determination of whether the deferred policy acquisition costs are recoverable aig believes the inclusion of anticipated investment income in the recoverability analysis is a preferable accounting policy because it 174 includes in the recoverability analysis the fact that there is a timing difference between when the premiums are collected and in turn invested and when the losses and related expenses are paid this is considered a change in accounting principle that requires retrospective application to all periods presented because aig historically has not recorded any premium deficiency on its short duration insurance contracts even without the inclusion of anticipated investment income there were no changes to the historical financial statements for the change in accounting principle aig assesses the recoverability of its dac on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred this assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income on inforce business to the sum of expected claims claims adjustment expenses anticipated policy maintenance costs and unamortized dac if the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for dac this offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge management tested the recoverability of dac and determined that recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income for aig property casualty exceeded the sum of these costs at september 30 2012 on january 1 2012 aig adopted an accounting standard that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts the adoption of this standard resulted in a 5 1 billion decrease in the january 1 2012 consolidated dac balance fair value

the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability aig assessment of the significance of a particular unobservable input to the fair value measurement in its

super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions as of the periods ended data table removed regulatory capital portfolio during the nine month period ended september 30 2012 3 1 billion in net notional amount of regulatory capital cdss were terminated or matured at no cost the expected maturity of this portfolio continues to be monitored as of september 30 2012 the estimated weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was less than one year there have been no requirements to make any payments as part of terminations of super senior regulatory capital cdss initiated by counterparties the regulatory benefit of these transactions for financial institution counterparties was generally derived from basel i in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision finalized basel iii which when fully implemented may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions in prior years it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from basel i to an intermediate standard known as basel ii which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions at the end of 2009 basel iii has now superseded basel ii but the details of its implementation by the various european central banking districts have not been finalized should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame 177 in light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data to the extent deemed relevant and available aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2012 other than for transactions where global capital markets believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief although aig believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties the counterparties early termination rights and the expectation that such rights will be exercised preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions arbitrage portfolio a portion of the super senior credit default swaps as of september 30 2012 are arbitrage motivated transactions written on multi sector cdos or designated pools of investment grade senior unsecured corporate debt or clos multi sector cdos the following table summarizes gross transaction notional amount of the multi sector cdos on which protection was written on the super senior tranche subordination below the super senior risk layer net notional amount and fair value of derivative liability by underlying collateral type data table removed a total outstanding principal amount of securities held by a cdo b high grade refers to transactions in which the underlying collateral credit ratings on a stand alone basis were predominantly aa or higher at origination c mezzanine refers to transactions in which the underlying collateral credit ratings on a stand alone basis were predominantly a or lower at origination corporate debt clos the corporate arbitrage portfolio consists principally of cds written on portfolios of corporate obligations that were generally rated investment grade at the inception of the cds these cds transactions require cash settlement this portfolio also includes cds with a net notional amount of 1 2 billion written on the senior part of the capital structure of clos which require physical settlement valuation sensitivity arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aig calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average prices for cdos increased during 2012 further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions 178 for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the binomial expansion technique bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the total 4 4 billion net notional amount of cds written on multi sector cdos outstanding at september 30 2012 a bet value is available for 2 8 billion net notional amount no bet value is determined for 1 6 billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 2 8 billion the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities while the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a cdo the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile especially given current market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo at this time the following table presents key inputs used in the bet model and the potential increase decrease to the fair value of the derivative liability by abs category at september 30 2012 corresponding to changes in these key inputs data table removed a the diversity score is an input at the cdo level a calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible b the discount curve is an input at the cdo level a calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible furthermore for this input it is not possible to disclose a weighted average input as a discount curve consists of a series of data points these results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption no assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed perhaps significantly the ranges assumed by aig for purposes of the above analysis no assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these key inputs can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above regulatory environment in addition to the information set forth in this quarterly report on form 10 q aig regulatory status is also discussed in part i item 1 business regulation in the 2011 annual report aig operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities including insurance securities investment advisory banking and thrift regulators in the united states and abroad federal reserve supervision as a result of the completion of the september 14 2012 registered public offering of aig common stock the department of the treasury ceased to own a majority of the outstanding shares of aig common stock and consequently aig is regulated and subject to the examination supervision and enforcement authority and reporting 179 requirements of the frb as successor to the u s office of thrift supervision ots as an slhc because aig was grandfathered as a unitary slhc in1999 aig generally is not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage as long as aig federal savings bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank dissolved the ots and transferred its functions and personnel to the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the frb supervision of federal savings associations such as aig federal savings bank has been transferred to the occ and supervision of slhcs has been transferred to the frb elements of dodd frank also align the regulation of slhcs more closely to that of bank holding companies and the frb is taking additional steps to do so under both dodd frank and the frb supervisory and rulemaking authority over slhcs changes mandated by dodd frank include directing the frb to promulgate minimum capital requirements for slhcs in addition the frb as the primary supervisor for slhc has the authority to impose enhanced prudential standards on slhcs the frb occ and fdic have proposed revised minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements that would apply to all bank holding companies and slhcs as well as to insured depository institutions such as aig federal savings bank as required by dodd frank the frb has also proposed enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding company and nonbank sifis and has stated its intention to propose enhanced prudential standards for slhcs pursuant to the home owners loan act the proposed regulations are described below aig cannot predict whether the capital regulations will be adopted as proposed or what enhanced prudential standards the frb will promulgate for slhcs either generally or as applicable to insurance businesses further aig cannot predict how the frb will exercise general supervisory authority over aig although the frb could as a prudential matter for example limit aig ability to pay dividends repurchase shares of its common stock or acquire or enter into other businesses aig cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether dodd frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally impact aig businesses results of operations cash flows or financial condition or require aig to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of aig credit ratings in addition dodd frank requires sifis to be subject to regulation examination and supervision by the frb including minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements nonbank sifis will be designated by the financial stability oversight council council created by dodd frank if aig is designated as a sifi aig will be regulated by the frb both in that capacity and in its capacity as an slhc the regulations applicable to sifis and to slhcs when all have been adopted as final rules may differ materially from each other in october 2012 aig received a notice that it is under consideration by the council for a proposed determination that it is a sifi the notice stated that aig will be reviewed in stage 3 of the sifi determination process described in the council interpretive guidance for nonbank financial company determinations volcker rule in july 2012 section 619 of dodd frank referred to as the volcker rule became effective though the final rule implementing section 619 has not yet been released under the proposed rule released in october 2011 if aig continues to control aig federal savings bank aig and its affiliates are considered banking entities for purposes of the rule and after the rule conformance date of july 21 2014 would be prohibited from proprietary trading and sponsoring or investing in covered funds subject to the rule exceptions even if aig no longer controlled an insured depository institution it could be subject to restrictions on these activities if it is designated as a sifi as dodd frank authorizes the frb to subject sifis to capital requirements quantitative limits or other restrictions if they engage in activities prohibited for banking entities under the volcker rule the volcker rule as proposed contains an exemption for proprietary trading by insurance companies for their general account but the final breadth and scope of this exemption is uncertain capital requirements before dodd frank the ots did not subject slhcs to consolidated regulatory capital requirements section 171 of dodd frank the so called collins amendment subjects slhcs to capital requirements that are not less stringent than the requirements generally applicable to insured depository institutions or quantitatively lower than the requirements in effect for insured depository institutions as of july 21 2010 180 the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to insured depository institutions such as aig federal savings bank are computed in accordance with the u s federal banking agencies generally applicable risk based capital requirements which are based on accords established by the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee these accords have evolved over time and are referred to as basel i basel ii and basel iii in june 2012 the frb and the other federal banking agencies proposed modifications to their existing capital adequacy regulations to address both the collins amendment and basel iii the frb would apply these revised capital adequacy regulations to slhcs upon the effective date of the regulations which is proposed to be january 1 2013 matching the international basel iii phase in calendar the federal banking agencies have also proposed to replace their existing basel i based rules for determining risk weighted assets rwas a component of capital ratios with a basel ii based version to make them more risk sensitive this proposal to implement the basel ii standardized approach with modifications would take effect on january 1 2015 under the collins amendment and the proposed rules the basel ii standardized approach or prior to the change current bank capital rules would serve as a floor for determining rwas and resulting capital ratios for institutions subject to the advanced approaches under the proposed rules aig would be subject to the advanced approaches and would be required to begin their implementation subject to a parallel run period if the revised capital adequacy rules are adopted as proposed they will become effective on january 1 2013 and fully phased in by january 1 2019 on january 1 2019 the rules will require a minimum ratio of tier 1 common equity to rwas of at least 4 5 percent plus a 2 5 percent capital conservation buffer which is added to the 4 5 percent tier 1 common equity ratio as that buffer is phased in effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of tier 1 common equity to rwas of at least 7 percent a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to rwas of at least 6 0 percent plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the 6 0 percent tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in effectively resulting in a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 8 5 percent upon full implementation a minimum ratio of total that is tier 1 plus tier 2 capital to rwas of at least 8 0 percent plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the 8 0 percent total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10 5 percent upon full implementation for advanced approaches institutions a minimum leverage ratio of 3 percent calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital to average balance sheet exposures plus certain average off balance sheet exposures and a countercyclical capital buffer applicable only to institutions subject to the advanced approaches generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk that would be a tier 1 common equity add on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0 percent to 2 5 percent and if applied potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2 5 percent and 5 percent the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of tier 1 common equity to rwas above the minimum but below the conservation buffer or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer when and if the latter is applied will face progressive constraints on dividends equity repurchases and certain executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall as proposed the capital buffer would phase in at 0 625 percent per year beginning on january 1 2016 until it reaches its 2 5 percent fully phased in level on january 1 2019 also in june 2012 the frb and the other federal banking agencies issued revised final rules that modify their market risk regulatory capital requirements for banking institutions with significant trading activities these modifications are designed to address the adjustments to the market risk regulatory capital framework that were announced by the basel committee in june 2010 referred to as basel ii 5 as well as the prohibition on the use of external credit ratings as required by dodd frank these changes will also be implemented in january 2013 and will result in increased regulatory capital requirements for market risk if the rules are adopted as proposed aig will be required to meet the following initial minimum capital ratios on january 1 2013 3 5 percent tier 1 common equity to rwas 4 5 percent tier 1 capital to rwas and 8 0 percent total capital to rwas 181 although aig is still considering the full impact of these capital requirements aig believes that if the frb proposed rules become effective and apply to aig as an slhc it will meet all revised minimum capital requirements as of january 1 2013 the basel iii final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to tier 1 common equity which will begin on january 1 2014 and will be phased in over a five year period 20 percent per year the basel committee has also published its final provisions for assessing the global systemic importance of banking institutions and the range of additional tier 1 common equity that should be maintained by banking institutions deemed to be globally systemically important the additional capital for these institutions would initially range from 1 percent to 2 5 percent of tier 1 common equity and could be as much as 3 5 percent aig was not one of the institutions identified by the financial stability board established at the direction of the leaders of the group of 20 as a global systemically important bank under the basel committee methodology the final determination of whether an institution will be classified as a global systemically important bank and the calculation of the required additional capital amount is expected to be disclosed by the basel committee no later than november 2014 based on data through the end of 2013 the international association of insurance supervisors iais has proposed an assessment methodology for identifying global systemically important insurance companies which could also be subject to additional capital requirements and has committed to make its final recommendations to the financing stability board by march 2013 in june 2012 the basel committee also released a consultation paper proposing approaches for calculating incremental capital requirements for domestic systemically important banks the recommendation is complementary to the framework outlined above for global systemically important banks but is more principles based in order to provide an appropriate degree of national discretion these proposals may impact the regulatory capital requirements of aig but the exact impact will depend on the final framework and how it is implemented by the u s federal banking agencies both in general and as specifically applied to insurance companies in may 2012 the basel committee released a consultation paper proposing a fundamental review of the trading book the paper proposes a series of comprehensive changes to the regulatory capital requirements for market risk which if enacted by the u s federal banking agencies would likely replace the basel ii 5 requirements that as outlined above become effective in january 2013 heightened prudential standards in january 2012 the frb published for public comment a notice of proposed rulemaking implementing the enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements mandated by dodd frank that will apply to large bank holding companies and sifis if those rules are adopted in the form proposed and aig is designated as a sifi aig would be required among other things to calculate aig minimum risk based and leverage capital requirements each as if it were a bank holding company to submit annually to the frb for approval a capital plan detailing aig projected capital distributions and demonstrating that it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a ratio of basel i tier 1 common equity to rwas currently of at least 5 percent on a pro forma basis under expected and stressed conditions throughout the nine quarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan to maintain a ratio of tier 1 common equity to risk weighted assets of 5 0 percent under both expected and stressed conditions in order to be able to engage in capital distributions to comply with additional liquidity related requirements such as to produce comprehensive cash flow projections to regularly stress test cash flow projections to maintain a liquidity buffer of highly liquid assets that are unencumbered to establish and maintain a contingency funding plan for liquidity stress events and to establish or maintain limits on potential sources of liquidity risk not to have aggregate net credit exposure to any single unaffiliated counterparty that exceeds 25 percent of aig consolidated capital stock and surplus or 10 percent if the counterparty has 500 billion or more in total consolidated assets to be subject to an annual stress test conducted by the frb and annual and semi annual self administered stress tests 182 to be subject to early remediation actions upon occurrence of trigger events such as failure to maintain the capital that is commensurate with the level and nature of the risks to which aig is exposed or non compliance with the frb stress test which early remediation actions could vary from heightened supervisory review by the frb to an frb recommended resolution of aig based on the seriousness of the trigger events to maintain a debt to equity ratio measured by total liabilities and total equity capital of no more than 15 to 1 upon a determination by the council that i the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and ii the imposition of such requirement is necessary to mitigate the risk that such company poses to the financial stability of the united states and to comply with certain corporate governance requirements such as additional responsibilities of the board of directors and the creation of a separate risk committee of the board of directors in addition certain of dodd frank stress test requirements will separately apply to aig as an slhc irrespective of whether aig is designated as a sifi the notice of proposed rulemaking did not include the requirements that will apply to slhcs which will be proposed in a separate notice aig cannot predict whether there will be significant differences between the requirements for large bank holding companies and sifis and the requirements for slhcs or whether the requirements for slhcs will have specific provisions for companies in the insurance business other effects of dodd frank in addition dodd frank will also have the following effects on aig if aig is designated as a sifi the frb could i limit aig ability to merge with acquire consolidate with or become affiliated with another company to offer specified financial products or to terminate specified activities ii impose conditions on how we conduct our activities or iii with approval of the council and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to u s financial stability require aig to sell or otherwise transfer assets or off balance sheet items to unaffiliated entities if aig is designated as a sifi aig must periodically report to regulators a resolution plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure if the regulators determine that aig resolution plan is not credible they may impose restrictions on aig including additional capital requirements or limits on growth in addition to the adoption of dodd frank in the united states regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future the financial stability board fsb consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the g20 nations has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies particularly global systemically important financial institutions should be regulated these frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision capital and solvency standards systemic economic risk corporate governance including compensation and a host of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis the fsb has directed the iais to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body insurance core principles iais insurance core principles form the baseline threshold for how countries financial services regulatory efforts are measured relative to the insurance sector that measurement is made by periodic financial sector assessment program reviews conducted by the world bank and the international monetary fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country specific additional or amended regulatory changes lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which aig subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holdings companies by the financial services agency in japan financial and banking regulation adopted in france and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in germany and the united kingdom financial services authority in july 2012 the iais released a working draft of its common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups which provides for global coordinated supervision of internationally active insurance groups iaigs aig is likely to be designated an iaig aig cannot predict whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on aig business results of operations cash flows financial condition and credit ratings 183 item 3 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
