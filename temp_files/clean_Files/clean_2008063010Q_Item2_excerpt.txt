update or alter any projection or other statement whether written or oral that may be made from time to time whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 38 american international group inc and subsidiaries in addition to reviewing aigs results for the three and six months ended june 30 2008 this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supplements and updates the information and discussion included in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aig presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful statutory loss ratios and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance filed with insurance regulatory authorities and used for analysis in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with aigs insurance competitors aig also uses cross references to additional information included in this quarterly report on form 10 q and in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject overview of operations and business results aig identifies its reportable segments by product line consistent with its management structure these segments are general insurance life insurance and retirement services financial services and asset management through these operating segments aig provides insurance financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions this geographic product and service diversification is one of aigs major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors aigs other category consists of items not allocated to aigs operating segments aigs subsidiaries serve commercial institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network in the united states aig companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and are among the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well aigs financial services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing capital markets operations and consumer finance both in the united states and abroad aig also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals as part of its spread based investment activities and to finance its operations aig issues various debt instruments in the public and private markets outlook the following paragraphs supplement and update the information and discussion included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k to reflect developments in or affecting aigs business to date during 2008 these paragraphs also supplement and update item 1a risk factors in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k general trends in mid 2007 the u s residential mortgage market began to experience serious disruption due to credit quality deterioration in a significant portion of loans originated particularly to non prime and subprime borrowers evolving changes in the regulatory environment a residential housing market characterized by a slowing pace of transactions and declining prices increased cost and reduced availability of borrowings for mortgage participants a rising unemployment rate increased delinquencies in non mortgage consumer credit and illiquid credit markets the conditions continued and worsened throughout 2007 and to date in 2008 expanding into the broader u s credit markets and resulting in greater volatility less liquidity widening of credit spreads a lack of price transparency and increased credit losses in certain markets aig participates in the u s residential mortgage market in several ways american general finance inc agf originates principally first lien mortgage loans and to a lesser extent second lien mortgage loans to buyers and owners of residential housing united guaranty corporation ugc provides first loss mortgage guaranty insurance for high loan to value first and second lien residential mortgages aig insurance and financial services subsidiaries invest in mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations cdos in which the underlying collateral is composed in whole or in part of residential mortgage loans and aig financial products corp and aig trading group inc and their respective subsidiaries collectively aigfp provides credit protection through credit default swaps on certain super senior tranches of cdos continuing disruption in the u s residential mortgage and other credit markets may also increase claim activity in the financial institution segment of aigs directors and officers liability d and o and professional liability classes of business however based on its review of information currently available aig believes overall loss activity for the broader d and o and professional liability classes is likely to remain within or near the levels observed during the last several years which include losses related to stock options backdating as well as to the u s residential mortgage market the operating results of aigs consumer finance and mortgage guaranty operations in the united states have been and are likely to continue to be adversely affected by the factors referred to above the downward cycle in the u s housing market is not expected to improve until residential inventories return to a more normal level and the mortgage credit market stabilizes the duration and severity of the downward cycle could be further negatively affected in the event of an economic recession aig expects that this 39 american international group inc and subsidiaries downward cycle will continue to adversely affect ugcs operating results for the foreseeable future and will result in a significant operating loss for ugc through at least the first half of 2009 aig also incurred substantial unrealized market valuation losses on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio and substantial other than temporary impairment charges on aigs available for sale securities in the first six months of 2008 and fourth quarter of 2007 the results from aigs operations with exposure to the u s residential mortgage market will be highly dependent on future market conditions continuing market deterioration will cause aig to report additional unrealized market valuation losses and impairment charges given the current difficult market conditions aig is not able to predict the extent of any future market valuation losses or impairment charges moreover aig is unable to assess the effect if any that recent transactions involving sales of large portfolios of cdos will have on the pricing of its credit default swaps referenced cdos or available for sale securities or on collateral posting requirements there can be no assurance that increased claims activity operating losses unrealized market valuation losses and impairment charges will not be material to aigs consolidated financial condition or aigs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the ongoing effect of the downward cycle in the u s housing market on aigs consolidated financial condition could be material if the market disruption continues to expand beyond the residential mortgage markets notwithstanding aigs efforts to mitigate the risks to its business by disciplined underwriting and active risk management aig is also exploring measures to further protect its capital reduce risks where appropriate and enhance its overall liquidity a significant portion of aigfps guaranteed investment agreements gias and financial derivative transactions include provisions that require aigfp upon a downgrade of aigs long term debt ratings to post collateral or with the consent of the counterparties assign or repay its positions or arrange a substitute guarantee of its obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings it is estimated that as of the close of business on july 31 2008 based on aigfps outstanding municipal gias and financial derivative transactions at that date a downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings to a1 by moodys investors service moodys and a by standard and poors a division of the mcgraw hill companies inc s and p would permit counterparties to make additional calls for up to approximately 13 3 billion of collateral while a downgrade to a2 by moodys and a by s and p would permit counterparties to call for approximately 1 2 billion of additional collateral if either of moodys or s and p downgraded aigs ratings to a1 or a respectively the estimated collateral call would be for up to approximately 10 5 billion while a downgrade to a2 or a respectively by either of the two rating agencies would permit counterparties to call for up to approximately 1 1 billion of additional collateral furthermore a downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings to a1 by moodys or to the same levels by both rating agencies would permit either aig or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts resulting in payments of up to approximately 4 6 billion while a downgrade to a2 by moodys and a by s and p would permit either aig or the counterparties to elect early termination of additional contracts resulting in additional payments of up to approximately 800 million aigfp believes that it is unlikely that certain of these counterparties would exercise their rights to elect termination of their contracts given the substantial economic benefit that such counterparties would forfeit upon termination the actual amount of collateral that aigfp would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades or the aggregate amount of payments that aig could be required to make depends on market conditions the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade additional obligations to post collateral or the costs of assignment repayment or alternative credit support would increase the demands on aigs liquidity further downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral which could have a material adverse effect on aigs liquidity for a further discussion of aigs credit ratings and the potential effect of posting collateral on aigs liquidity see capital resources and liquidity credit ratings and liquidity herein globally heightened regulatory scrutiny of financial services companies in many jurisdictions has the potential to affect future financial results through higher compliance costs this is particularly true in the united states where federal and state authorities have commenced various investigations of the financial services industry and in japan and southeast asia where financial institutions have received remediation orders affecting consumer and policyholder rights as a result of the disruption of the u s residential housing market aig recognized other than temporary impairment charges over the last three quarters accordingly any accretion to the expected recovery amount will be recognized in earnings in future periods over the expected recovery periods aig tested goodwill for impairment as of june 30 2008 and no impairment was identified however as a result of structural trends in the consumer finance market and the current competitive environment in the personal lines market 40 american international group inc and subsidiaries the excess of the fair value over the carrying value of aigs consumer finance and personal lines reporting units has narrowed as of june 30 2008 goodwill related to each of these reporting units amounted to approximately 700 million a continuation of these trends could result in impairment in goodwill for these reporting units in the future general insurance the commercial property and casualty insurance industry has historically experienced cycles of price erosion followed by rate strengthening as a result of catastrophes or other significant losses that affect the overall capacity of the industry to provide coverage as premium rates decline aig will generally experience higher current accident year loss ratios as the written premiums are earned and higher expense ratios if written premiums decline more quickly than expenses despite industry price erosion in commercial lines aig expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new general insurance businesses as a result of aigs broad product line and extensive distribution networks in the united states and abroad workers compensation remains under considerable pricing pressure as statutory rates continue to decline rates for most casualty lines of insurance continue to decline due to competitive pressures particularly for aviation excess casualty and d and o exposures rates for commercial property lines are also declining following another year of relatively low catastrophe losses in 2007 a decline that is continuing despite increased natural catastrophe losses in 2008 further price erosion is expected during the remainder of 2008 for the commercial lines aig seeks to mitigate the decline by constantly seeking out profitable opportunities across its diverse product lines and distribution networks while maintaining a commitment to underwriting discipline there can be no assurance that price erosion will not become more widespread or that aigs profitability will not deteriorate from current levels in major commercial lines the personal lines automobile insurance industry is currently experiencing a soft market industry underwriting results are expected to deteriorate due to a generally weakening economy and increasing loss trends aigs personal auto business has been affected by these trends but aig has filed rate increases tightened underwriting guidelines and made pricing enhancements to seek to improve the underwriting results aig has capital maintenance agreements with the companies included in the commercial insurance and mortgage guaranty reporting units that set forth procedures through which aig will provide ongoing capital support aig expects that additional capital contributions may be required during the remainder of 2008 pursuant to these agreements life insurance and retirement services disruption in the u s residential mortgage and credit markets had a significant adverse effect on life insurance and retirement services operating results specifically its net investment income and net realized capital losses in 2007 and the first six months of 2008 and aig expects that this disruption will continue to be a key factor in the remainder of 2008 and beyond especially in its u s based operations the volatility in operating results will be further magnified by the continuing market shift to variable products with living benefits in response to the market disruption aig including domestic life and domestic retirement services has been increasing its liquidity position and investing in shorter duration investments while prudent in the current environment such actions will reduce overall investment yields for the foreseeable future recent capital markets volatility has put pressure on credit lenders resulting in increased costs for premium financing which could affect future sales of products where such financing is used primarily in large universal life policies in domestic life insurance the u s dollar has significantly weakened against many currencies resulting in a favorable effect on operating results due to the translation of foreign currencies to the u s dollar however the weakened dollar has an unfavorable effect on other than temporary impairments in foreign life insurance and retirement services and will continue to affect operating results throughout 2008 during the second quarter of 2008 aig made capital contributions aggregating 1 1 billion to the surplus of certain of its domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services subsidiaries to replace a portion of the capital lost as a result of net realized capital losses including other than temporary impairments in taiwan 361 million was contributed to meet the needs of this growing business and increased risk based capital requirements aig expects that it will make additional capital contributions to these operations during the remainder of 2008 in large measure due to the continued effect of net realized capital losses resulting from severity related other than temporary impairment charges financial services during 2008 aigfps revenues from certain products have declined in part as a consequence of the continued disruption in the credit markets the general decline in liquidity in the marketplace and aigfps efforts to manage its liquidity furthermore aigfp has not been able to replace revenues previously generated from certain structured tax and credit derivative transactions that were terminated or matured at the end of 2007 and early 2008 aig expects that 41 american international group inc and subsidiaries aigfps operating results will continue to be adversely affected for the foreseeable future aig exercises significant judgment in the valuation of its various credit default swap portfolios aig uses pricing models and other methodologies to value these portfolios that take into account where applicable and to the extent possible third party prices pricing matrices the movement of indices such as the cdx and itraxx collateral calls and other observable market data aig believes that the assumptions and judgments it makes are reasonable and lead to an overall methodology that is reasonable but other market participants may use other methodologies including among other things models indices and selection of third party pricing sources that are based upon different assumptions and judgments and these methodologies may generate materially different values for additional information regarding aigs methodology models and assumptions with respect to the valuation and credit based analyses of the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio see critical accounting estimates fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio and valuation of level 3 assets and liabilities super senior credit default swap portfolio see risk management credit derivatives the ongoing disruption in the u s residential mortgage and credit markets and the downgrades of residential mortgage backed securities and cdo securities by rating agencies continue to adversely affect the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio written by aigfp aig expects that continuing limitations on the availability of market observable data will affect aigs determinations of the fair value of these derivatives the fair value of these derivatives is expected to continue to fluctuate perhaps materially in response to changing market conditions and aigs estimates of the value of aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio at future dates could therefore be materially different from current estimates further declines in the fair values of these derivatives may also require aigfp to post additional collateral which may be material to aigfps financial condition at june 30 2008 the fair value of aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio a net loss of 26 1 billion represents aigs best estimate of the amount it would need to pay a willing able and knowledgeable third party to assume the obligations under aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio at that date at june 30 2008 aig used a roll rate analysis to stress the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio for potential pre tax realized credit losses two scenarios illustrated in this process resulted in potential realized credit losses of approximately 5 0 billion scenario a and approximately 8 5 billion scenario b actual ultimate realized credit losses are likely to vary perhaps materially from these scenarios and there can be no assurance that the ultimate realized credit losses related to the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with either scenario or that such realized credit losses will not exceed the potential realized credit losses illustrated by scenario b for a further discussion of aigs stress testing using the roll rate analyses see risk management stress testing sensitivity analysis approximately 307 billion of the 441 billion in notional exposure on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio as of june 30 2008 was written to facilitate regulatory capital relief for financial institutions primarily in europe aig expects that the majority of these transactions will be terminated within the next 9 to 21 months by aigfps counterparties when they no longer provide the regulatory capital benefit in light of early termination experience to date and after other comprehensive analyses aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment to be recognized for this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the six months ended june 30 2008 other than for transactions where aigfp believes the counterparties are no longer using the transactions to obtain regulatory capital relief aig will continue to assess the valuation of this portfolio and monitor developments in the marketplace given the significant deterioration in the global credit markets and the risk that aigfps expectations with respect to the termination of these transactions by its counterparties may not materialize there can be no assurance that aig will not recognize unrealized market valuation losses from this portfolio in future periods and recognition of even a small percentage decline in the fair value of this portfolio could be material to an individual reporting period these transactions contributed approximately 156 million to aigfps revenues in the six month period ended june 30 2008 if aigfp is not successful in replacing the revenues generated by these transactions aigfps operating results could be materially adversely affected the airline industry is experiencing financial stress primarily due to record high fuel costs tightening of the credit markets and generally worsening economic conditions this financial stress is causing a slow down in the airline industry and will likely have a negative effect on future lease rates and could begin to influence ilfcs results of operations as some airlines may approach ilfc to renegotiate transactions asset management in the institutional

taxes minority interest and net income loss were as follows data table removed aigs consolidated revenues decreased in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2008 compared to the same periods in 2007 due to unrealized market valuation losses of 5 6 billion and 14 7 billion respectively on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio recorded in other income higher net realized capital losses and a decline in net investment income which more than offset growth in premiums and other considerations in the life insurance and retirement services segment net realized capital losses of 6 1 billion and 12 2 billion in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2008 respectively included other than temporary impairment charges of 6 8 billion and 12 4 billion primarily related to the

as lower policyholder trading gains in life insurance and retirement services policyholder trading gains are offset by a charge to incurred policy losses and benefits expense income loss before income taxes and minority interest declined in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2008 due primarily to the losses described above income taxes the effective tax rate on the pre tax loss for the three month period ended june 30 2008 was 38 4 percent the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to tax benefits from foreign operations and tax exempt interest the effective tax rate on the pre tax loss for the six month period ended june 30 2008 was 34 4 percent the effective tax rate was adversely affected by 703 million of tax charges from the first three months of 2008 comprised of increases in the reserves for uncertain tax positions and other discrete period items the effective tax rate on the pre tax income for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2007 was 26 5 percent and 27 2 percent respectively the effective tax rates were low due primarily to benefits from remediation adjustments and the recognition of tax benefits

the world revenues in the general insurance segment represent net premiums earned net investment income and net realized capital gains losses the decrease in general insurance revenues in the three month period ended june 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 was due to higher net realized capital losses in the three month period ended june 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 and lower net investment income as returns on partnership investments declined the decrease in general insurance revenues in the six month period ended june 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 was

partnership investments declined the decrease in general insurance operating income in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 was principally due to lower underwriting profit and net investment income from aig commercial insurance commercial insurance as well as net realized capital losses incurred by commercial insurance in 2008 operating losses from the mortgage guaranty business and a decline in foreign general insurance net investment income in 2008 also contributed to the decrease in general insurance operating income life insurance and

before the effects of counterparty netting adjustments the valuation of the super senior credit derivatives continues to be challenging given the limitation on the availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in the structured finance market particularly during and since the fourth quarter of 2007 these market conditions have increased the reliance on management estimates and judgments in arriving at an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes further disparities in the valuation methodologies employed by market participants and the varying judgments reached by such participants when assessing volatile markets has increased the likelihood that the various parties to these instruments may arrive at significantly different estimates as to their fair values aigfps valuation methodologies for the super senior credit default swap portfolio have evolved in response to the deteriorating market conditions and the lack of sufficient market observable information aig has sought to calibrate the model to market information and to review the assumptions of the model on a regular basis during the second quarter of 2008 aigfp implemented further refinements to the cash flow waterfall used by the bet model and the assumptions used therein these refinements reflected the ability of a cdo to use principal proceeds to cover interest payment obligations on lower rated tranches the ability of a cdo to use principal proceeds to cure a breach of an overcollateralization test the ability of a cdo to amortize certain senior cdo tranches on a pro rata or sequential basis and the preferential payment of management fees to the extent there is a lag in the prices provided by the collateral managers aig refines those prices by rolling them forward to the end of the quarter using prices provided by a third party pricing service the net effect of these refinements was an increase in the unrealized market valuation loss of 342 million refinements made during the first quarter of 2008 had only a de minimus effect on the unrealized market valuation loss aigfp employs a modified version of the bet

collateral managers the bet model also uses diversity scores weighted average lives recovery rates and discount rates the determination of some of these inputs requires the use of judgment and estimates particularly in the absence of market observable data aigfp also employs a monte carlo simulation to assist in quantifying the effect on valuation of the cdo of the unique features of the cdos structure such as triggers that divert cash flows to the most senior level of the capital structure aig selected the bet model for the following reasons data table removed aigs implementation of the bet model uses a monte carlo simulation of the cash flows of each underlying cdo for various scenarios of defaults by the underlying collateral securities the monte carlo simulation allows the model to take into account the cash flow waterfall and to capture the benefits due to cash flow diversion within each cdo the bet model has certain limitations a well known limitation of the bet model is that it can understate the expected losses for super senior tranches when default correlations are high the model uses correlations implied from diversity scores which do not capture the tendency for correlations to increase as defaults increase recognizing this concern aig tested the sensitivity of the valuations to the diversity scores the results of the testing demonstrated that the valuations are not very sensitive to the diversity scores because the expected losses generated from the prices of the collateral pool securities are currently high breaching the attachment point in most transactions once the attachment point is breached by a sufficient amount the diversity scores and their implied correlations are no longer a significant driver of the valuation of a super senior tranche the credit default swaps written by aigfp generally cover the failure of payment on the super senior cdo security which in certain cases may also cover the acceleration of the super senior cdo security upon an event of default of the cdo aigfp does not own the securities in the cdo collateral pool the credit spreads implied from the market prices of the securities in the cdo collateral pool incorporate the risk of default credit risk the markets price for liquidity risk and in distressed markets the risk aversion 51 american international group inc and subsidiaries costs spreads on credit derivatives tend to be narrower than the credit spreads implied from the market prices of the securities in the cdo collateral pool because unlike investing in a bond there is no need to fund the position except when an actual credit event occurs in times of illiquidity the difference between spreads on cash securities and derivative instruments the negative basis may be even wider for high quality assets aigfp was unable to reliably verify this negative basis with market observable inputs due to the accelerating severe dislocation illiquidity and lack of trading in the abs market during the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first six months of 2008 the valuations produced by the bet model therefore represent the valuations of the underlying super senior cdo cash securities based on aigs assumptions about those securities albeit with no recognition of any potential effect of the basis differential on that valuation aigfp also considered the valuation of the super senior cdo securities provided by third parties including counterparties to these transactions and made adjustments as necessary valuation sensitivity set forth in the paragraphs below are sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aigs calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur aig is also unable to assess the effect if any that recent transactions involving sales of large portfolios of cdos will have on the pricing of the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses the most significant assumption used in developing the estimate is the pricing of the securities within the cdo collateral pools these prices are used to derive default probabilities and expected losses that are used in the bet model if the actual pricing of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the pricing used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate a decrease by five points for example from 87 cents per dollar to 82 cents per dollar in the aggregate price of the underlying collateral securities would cause an additional unrealized market valuation loss of approximately 4 0 billion while an increase in the aggregate price of the underlying collateral securities by five points for example from 90 cents per dollar to 95 cents per dollar would reduce the unrealized market valuation loss by approximately 3 9 billion any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities given their significantly depressed valuations given the current difficult market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo at this time the following table presents other key inputs used in the valuation of the credit default swap portfolio written on the super senior securities issued by multi sector cdos

international group inc and subsidiaries in determining the quarterly loss development from prior accident years aig conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each profit center for example if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center as appropriate in the three month period

asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k aigs reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground up analysis in the six month period ended june 30 2008 aig maintained the ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims resulting from the recently completed reserve analyses a minor amount of adverse incurred loss development pertaining to asbestos was reflected in the six month period ended june 30 2008 as presented in the table that follows this development was primarily attributable to several large defendants the effect of which was largely offset by one large favorable settlement a moderate amount of favorable gross incurred loss development pertaining to environmental was reflected in the six month period ended june 30 2008 as presented in the table that follows this development was primarily attributable to recent favorable experience which was fully reinsured resulting in no favorable net development on environmental net reserves 65 american international group inc and subsidiaries a summary of reserve activity

written in 1984 and prior years the current environmental policies that aig underwrites on a claims made basis have been excluded from the following table data table removed a gross amounts were revised from the presentation in prior periods to reflect the inclusion of certain reserves not previously identified as asbestos and environmental related this revision had no effect on net reserves

asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were estimated as follows data table removed gross amounts were revised from the presentation in prior periods to reflect the inclusion of certain reserves not previously identified as asbestos and environmental related this revision had no effect on net reserves a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity was as follows data table removed survival ratios asbestos and environmental the following table presents aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at june 30 2008 and 2007 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the june 30 2008 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at june 30 2007 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments in addition aigs survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by the favorable settlement described above as well as several similar settlements during 2007 these settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at june 30 2008 by approximately 1 4 years and 3 0 years respectively and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at june 30 2007 by approximately 1 7 years and 4 1 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage 66 american international group inc and subsidiaries provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aigs determination of its reserves is not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at june 30 2008 and 2007 were as follows data table removed gross amounts for 2007 were revised from the presentation in prior

in addition net investment income and certain products continued to be affected by the volatile markets life insurance and retirement services total revenues in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2008 reflect growth in premiums and other considerations compared to the same periods in 2007 primarily due to strong production in the foreign life insurance and retirement services operations and sales of payout annuities in domestic life insurance overall growth in premiums and other considerations was dampened by a continuing shift to investment oriented products and the suspension in the second quarter of 2007 of new sales on certain products in japan pending completion of an industry wide review by the tax authorities this review was finalized in march 2008 and resulted in lower tax deductibility of these products for the policyholder although sales of these products have restarted in japan it is expected that sales will be at lower than historical levels net investment income decreased in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to significantly lower partnership yield enhancement and mutual fund

capital losses in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2008 compared to the same periods in 2007 were primarily related to severity impairments due to the credit market disruption and foreign exchange losses as a result of the weakening of the dollar against foreign currencies in addition to the higher net realized capital losses and lower net investment income noted above the operating loss for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2008 was unfavorably affected by an increased negative investment spread in taiwan and changes in actuarial estimates totaling 31 million in connection with domestic retirement services variable annuity products these decreases were partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates operating loss in the three month period

most significant effect on the life insurance and retirement services results was the change in measurement of fair value for embedded policy derivatives the pre tax effect of adoption related to embedded policy derivatives was an increase in net realized capital losses of 155 million as of january 1 2008 partially offset by a 47 million dac benefit related to these losses the effect of initial adoption was primarily due to an increase in the embedded policy derivative liability valuations resulting from the inclusion of explicit risk margins aig adopted fas 159 on january 1 2008 and elected to apply the fair value option to a closed block of single premium variable life business in japan and for an investment linked product sold principally in asia the adoption of fas 159 with

described below foreign life insurance and retirement services net realized capital losses were significantly higher in the first six months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the increased

capital gains losses the corresponding gain or loss with respect to the economically hedged bond is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the bond is sold matures or is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired the most significant effect of aigs adoption of fas 157 was the change in measurement of fair value for embedded policy derivatives the pre tax effect of adoption related to embedded policy derivatives was an increase in net realized capital losses of 155 million as of january 1 2008 the effect of initial adoption was primarily due to an increase in the embedded policy derivative liability valuations resulting from the inclusion of explicit risk margins deferred policy acquisition costs and sales inducement assets dac for life insurance and

million in the six month period ended june 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to higher production in the foreign life insurance operations and domestic retirement services total amortization expense increased by 81 million in the six month period ended june 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the current year amortization includes a 479 million increase to

primarily represents the cumulative effect of adoption of sop 05 1 as aig operates in various global markets the estimated gross profits used to amortize dac voba and sia are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period the combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and regions and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products and regions dac voba and sia for insurance oriented investment oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability which involves estimating the future profitability of current business this review involves significant management judgment if actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated aigs dac voba and sia may be subject to an impairment 83 american international group inc and subsidiaries charge and aigs results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods future policy benefit reserves periodically the net benefit reserves policy benefit reserves less dac established for life insurance and retirement services companies are tested to ensure that including consideration of future expected premium payments they are adequate to provide for future policyholder benefit obligations the assumptions used to perform the tests are current best estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality morbidity terminations company maintenance expenses and invested asset returns for long duration traditional business a lock in principle applies whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and dac are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience these assumptions include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions for business in force outside of north america 46 percent of total policyholder benefit liabilities at june 30 2008 represent traditional business where the lock in principle applies in most foreign locations various guarantees are embedded in policies in force that may remain applicable for many decades into the future as experience changes over time the best estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes because of the long term nature of many of aigs liabilities subject to the lock in principle small changes in certain of the assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy in particular changes in estimates of future invested asset return assumptions have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy taiwan beginning in 2000 the yield available on taiwanese 10 year government bonds dropped from approximately 6 percent to 2 7 percent at june 30 2008 yields on most other invested assets have correspondingly dropped over the same period current sales are focused on products such as data table removed in developing the reserve adequacy analysis for nan shan several key best estimate assumptions have been made observed historical mortality improvement trends have been projected to 2014 morbidity expense and termination rates have been updated to reflect recent experience taiwan government bond rates are expected to remain at current levels for 10 years and gradually increase to best estimate assumptions of a market consensus view of long term interest rate expectations foreign assets are assumed to comprise 35 percent of invested assets resulting in a composite long term investment assumption of approximately 4 8 percent and the current practice permitted in taiwan of offsetting positive mortality experience with negative interest margins thus eliminating the need for mortality dividends will continue future results of the reserve adequacy tests will involve significant management judgment as to mortality morbidity expense and termination rates and investment yields adverse changes in these assumptions could accelerate dac amortization and necessitate reserve strengthening 84 american international group inc and subsidiaries financial services operations aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified

financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions aigfp also participates as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions revenues and operating income of the capital markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are significantly affected by changes in the fair value of aigfps assets and liabilities and by the number size and profitability of transactions entered into during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period generally the realization of transaction revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on aigfps trading transactions is currently reflected in operating income as the fair values change from period to period aigfps products generally require sophisticated models and significant management assumptions to determine fair values and particularly during times of market disruption the absence of observable market data can result in fair values at any given balance sheet date that are not indicative of the ultimate settlement values of the products quarterly capital markets results capital markets reported an operating loss in the three month period ended june 30 2008 compared to operating income in the same period of 2007 primarily due to unrealized market valuation losses related to aigfps

senior on certain regulatory capital relief trades g fair value amounts are shown before the effects of counterparty netting adjustments during the second quarter of 2008 aigfp implemented further refinements to the cash flow waterfall used by the bet model and the assumptions used therein these refinements reflected the ability of a cdo to use principal proceeds to cover interest payment obligations on lower rated tranches the ability of a cdo to use principal proceeds to cure a breach of an overcollateralization test the ability of a cdo to amortize certain senior cdo tranches on a pro rata or sequential basis and the preferential payment of management fees to the extent there is a lag in the prices provided by the collateral managers aig refines those prices by rolling them forward to the end of the quarter using prices provided by a third party pricing service the net effect of these refinements was an incremental unrealized market valuation loss of 342 million refinements made during the first quarter of 2008 had only a de minimus effect on the unrealized market valuation loss during the three months ended june 30 2008 aigfp issued new 2a 7 puts on the

to purchase the referenced super senior obligations in the event of a failed remarketing of those securities upon the exercise of the put options the counterparty will provide funding to aigfp to purchase and hold the referenced super senior obligations for a period ranging from three to six years at this time aigfp is not party to any commitments to enter into any new 2a 7 puts included in the unrealized market valuation loss of the super senior credit default swap portfolio for the second quarter of 2008 was a loss of 810 million resulting from the change in fair value of these newly

to this obligation additionally aigfp purchased 682 million of other super senior cdo securities in connection with 2a 7 puts upon purchase these securities were included in aigfps trading portfolio at their fair value approximately 67 million of the cumulative unrealized market valuation loss previously recognized on these derivatives as of march 31 2008 was realized as a result of these purchases the change in fair value of aigfps credit default swaps was caused by the significant widening in spreads and the downgrades of rmbs and cdo securities by rating agencies in the six month period ended june 30 2008 driven by the credit concerns resulting from u s residential mortgages the severe liquidity crisis affecting the markets and the effects of rating agency downgrades on

valuation of aigfps assets and liabilities including 44 million of gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps losses of 362 million on the assets were primarily due to continued significant widening of credit spreads on cdos and abs products which represent a significant portion of aigfps investment portfolio while historically aigs credit spreads and those on its assets moved in a similar fashion that relationship did not exist in the second quarter of 2008 credit spreads on the abs and cdo investments widened significantly more than the widening in aigs credit spreads furthermore while aigs credit spreads increased during the second quarter of 2008 the credit valuation adjustment on its 87 american international group inc and

for the three month period ended june 30 2008 excluding intercompany transactions data table removed includes super senior cds portfolio during 2008 aigfps revenues from certain products have declined in part as a consequence of the continued disruption in the credit markets the general decline in liquidity in the marketplace and aigfps efforts to manage its liquidity furthermore aigfp has not been able to replace revenues previously generated from certain structured tax transactions that were terminated or matured at the end of 2007 and early 2008 the most significant component of capital markets operating expenses is compensation which was 155 million and 153 million in the three month periods ended june 30 2008 and 2007 respectively the amount of compensation was not affected by gains and losses arising from derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 in the first quarter of 2008 aigfp established an employee retention plan which guarantees a broad group of aigfps employees and consultants a minimum level of compensation for each of the 2008 and 2009 compensation years subject to mandatory partial deferral which in certain circumstances will be indexed to the price of aig stock the deferred amounts may be reduced in the event of losses prior to payment the expense related to the plan is being recognized over the vesting period beginning in

guidance by the u s treasury department affecting the ability to claim foreign tax credits effective january 1 2008 aigfp adopted fas 157 the most significant effect of adopting fas 157 was a change in the valuation methodologies for hybrid financial instruments and derivative liabilities both freestanding and embedded historically carried at fair value the changes were primarily to incorporate aigfps own credit risk when appropriate in the fair value measurements effective january 1 2008 aigfp also elected to apply the fair value option under fas 159 to all eligible assets and liabilities other than equity method investments and trade receivables and trade payables electing the fair value option allows aigfp to more closely align its earnings with the economics of its transactions by

ratings is not a complete list of ratings of aig and its subsidiaries ratings triggers have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or 100 american international group inc and subsidiaries more rating agencies ratings triggers generally relate to events that i could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability or require accelerated repayment ii could result in the termination of business contracts or iii could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties a significant portion of aigfps gias and financial derivative transactions include provisions that require aigfp upon a downgrade of aigs long term debt ratings to post collateral or with the consent of the counterparties assign or repay its positions or arrange a substitute guarantee of its obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings it is estimated that as of the close of business on july 31 2008 based on aigfps outstanding municipal gias and financial derivative transactions at that date a downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings to a1 by moodys and a by s and p would permit counterparties to make additional calls for up to approximately 13 3 billion of collateral while a downgrade to a2 by moodys and a by s and p would permit counterparties to call for approximately 1 2 billion of additional collateral if either of moodys or s and p downgraded aigs ratings to a1 or a respectively the estimated collateral call would be for up to approximately 10 5 billion while a downgrade to a2 or a respectively by either of the two rating agencies would permit counterparties to call for up to approximately 1 1 billion of additional collateral furthermore a downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings to a1 by moodys or to the same levels by both rating agencies would permit either aig or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts resulting in payments of up to approximately 4 6 billion while a downgrade to a2 by moodys and a by s and p would permit either aig or the counterparties to elect early termination of additional contracts resulting in additional payments of up to approximately 800 million aigfp believes that it is unlikely that certain of these counterparties would exercise their rights to elect termination of their contracts given the substantial economic benefit that such counterparties would forfeit upon termination the actual amount of collateral that aigfp would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades or the aggregate amount of payments that aig could be required to make depends on market conditions the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade additional obligations to post collateral or the costs of assignment repayment or alternative credit support would increase the demands on aigs liquidity further downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral which could have a material adverse effect on aigs liquidity contractual

the primary objectives are liquidity preservation of capital growth of surplus and generation of investment income to support the insurance products at the local operating unit level the strategies are based on considerations that include the local market liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification in addition to local risk management considerations aigs corporate risk management guidelines impose limitations on concentrations to promote diversification by industry asset class and geographic sector the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at aig consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities in the case of life insurance and retirement services companies as well as in the gic and mip portfolios of the asset management segment the fundamental investment strategy is as near as is practicable to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in the aig property casualty group consist primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provide attractive after tax return limited credit risk and generally good liquidity fixed maturity securities held by foreign general insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities the market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components including interest rate environment credit spread embedded optionality such as call features liquidity structural complexity foreign exchange risk and other credit and non credit factors however in most circumstances pricing is most sensitive to interest rates such that the market price declines as interest rates rise and 106 american international group inc and subsidiaries increases as interest rates fall this effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities aig marks to market the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies pursuant to fas 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and related accounting pronouncements however with limited exceptions primarily with respect to separate account products consolidated on aigs balance sheet pursuant to sop 03 01 aig does not mark to market its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities and falling interest rates have the opposite effect this results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains losses on securities in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative inverse changes in gains losses on aigs liabilities because aigs asset duration in certain low yield currencies particularly japan and taiwan is shorter than its liability duration aig views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the market value of its fixed maturity portfolio the majority of

significantly while this capital market stress has not to date been reflected in the performance of commercial mortgage securitization in the form of increased defaults in underlying mortgage pools pricing of cmbs has been adversely affected by market perceptions that underlying mortgage defaults will increase as a result aig recognized 387 million of other than temporary impairment charges in

short term investments of 1 4 billion liquidity in the securities pool is managed based upon historical experience regarding volatility of daily weekly and biweekly loan balances the decline in the

loss position to its recovery including fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale at each balance sheet date the decision to sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflects the judgment of aigs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale aig evaluates its investments for impairments in valuation as well as credit the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer its near term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances see critical accounting estimates other than temporary impairments herein for further information on aigs policy once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to

portfolio credit related factors such as credit spreads or credit default are not included in aigfps var calculation because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale at market is substantially hedged segregation of the financial instruments into trading and other than trading was not considered necessary aigfp operates under established market risk limits based upon this var calculation in addition aigfp backtests its var in the calculation of var for aigfp aig uses the historical simulation methodology based on estimated changes to the value of all transactions under explicit changes in market rates and prices within a specific historical time period aigfp attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices such as published exchange prices external

capital markets operations the diversified var is usually smaller than the sum of its components due to correlation effects data table removed credit derivatives aigfp enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary course of its business the majority of aigfps credit derivatives require aigfp to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities aigfp provides such credit protection on a second loss basis under which aigfps payment obligations arise only after credit losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold amount or level of first losses in certain cases the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies typically there will be an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio and then successive layers ranging from generally a bbb rated layer to one or more aaa rated layers in transactions that are rated with respect to the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior to the threshold level above which aigfps payment obligation would generally arise a significant majority were rated aaa at origination by the rating agencies in transactions that are not rated aigfp applies the same risk criteria for setting the threshold level for its payment obligations therefore the risk layer assumed by aigfp with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions is often called the super senior risk layer defined as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been rated aaa by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated equivalent thereto approximately 307 billion consisting of corporate loans and prime residential mortgages of the 441 billion in notional exposure of aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio as of june 30 2008 represented derivatives written for financial institutions principally in europe for the purpose of providing regulatory capital relief rather than risk mitigation in exchange for a minimum guaranteed fee the counterparties receive credit protection with respect to diversified loan portfolios they own thus improving their regulatory capital position these derivatives are generally expected to terminate at no additional cost to the counterparty when they no longer provide the regulatory capital benefit aig expects that the majority of these transactions will be terminated within the next 9 to 21 months by aigfps counterparties as of july 31 2008 80 7 billion in notional exposures have either been terminated or are in the process of being terminated aigfp was not required to make any payments as part of these terminations and in certain cases was paid a fee upon termination in light of early termination experience to date and after other comprehensive analyses aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the six month period ended june 30 2008 other than for transactions where aigfp believes the counterparties are no longer using the transactions to obtain regulatory capital relief aig will continue to assess the valuation of this portfolio and monitor developments in the marketplace given the significant deterioration in the credit markets and the risk that aigfps expectations with respect to the termination of these transactions by its counterparties may not materialize there can be no assurance that aig will not recognize unrealized market valuation losses from this portfolio in future periods and recognition of even a small percentage decline in the fair value of this portfolio could be material to an individual reporting period during the second quarter of 2008 a regulatory capital relief transaction with a notional amount of 1 6 billion and a fair value loss of 125 million was not terminated as expected when it no longer provided regulatory capital benefit to the counterparty this transaction provided protection on an rmbs unlike the other regulatory transactions which provide protection on loan portfolios held by the counterparties the documentation for this transaction contains provisions not included in aigfps other regulatory capital relief transactions which enable the counterparty to arbitrage a specific credit exposure approximately 54 billion of the 441 billion in notional exposure on aigfps super senior credit default swaps as of june 30 2008 was written on designated pools of investment grade corporate debt and clos aig estimates 120 american international group inc and subsidiaries the fair value of this corporate credit default swap portfolio by reference to benchmark indices including the cdx and itraxx and third party prices and collateral calls no assurance can be given that the fair value of aigs corporate credit default swap portfolio would not change materially if other market indices or pricing sources were used to estimate the fair value of the portfolio in addition to writing credit protection on the super senior risk layer on designated portfolios of loans or debt securities aigfp also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer at june 30 2008 the notional amount of the credit default swaps in the regulatory capital relief portfolio written on tranches below the super senior risk layer was 5 8 billion with an estimated fair value loss of 171 million while the credit default swaps written on corporate debt obligations are cash settled the majority of the credit default swaps written on cdos and clos require physical settlement under a physical settlement arrangement aigfp would be required to purchase the referenced super senior security at par in the event of a non payment on that security certain of the aigfp credit default swaps with an aggregate notional amount totaling 8 2 billion protect cdos that include over collateralization provisions that adjust the value of the collateral based in part on the ratings of the collateral underlying the cdos if the over collateralization provisions are not satisfied an event of default would occur creating a right to accelerate in certain of these circumstances aigfp may be required to purchase the referenced super senior security at par upon the acceleration of the security as of july 31 2008 six cdos for which aigfp had written credit protection on the super senior cdo securities had experienced events of default one of these cdos has been accelerated and aigfp extinguished a portion of its swap obligations by purchasing the protected cdo security for 103 million principal amount outstanding related to this obligation aigfps remaining notional exposure with respect to these cdos was 1 5 billion at july 31 2008 aigfp cannot currently quantify its obligations which might occur in the future under the foregoing provisions or determine the timing of any additional purchases that might be required therefore there can be no assurance that the extinguishment of these obligations by aigfp will not have a material effect on aigs liquidity aigfp has written 2a 7 puts in connection with certain multi sector cdos that allow the holders of the securities to treat the securities as eligible short term 2a 7 investments under the investment company act of 1940 holders of securities are permitted in certain circumstances to tender their securities to the issuers at par if an issuers remarketing agent is unable to resell the securities so tendered aigfp must purchase the securities at par as long as the security has not experienced a default during the six month period ended june 30 2008 aigfp repurchased securities with a principal amount of approximately 917 million in connection with these obligations in certain transactions aigfp has contracted with third parties to provide liquidity for the securities if they are put to aigfp for up to a three year period such liquidity facilities totaled 8 5 billion at june 30 2008 as of august 5 2008 aigfp has utilized 3 2 billion of these liquidity facilities at june 30 2008 aigfp had 11 3 billion of notional exposure on 2a 7 puts included as part of the multi sector cdo portfolio discussed herein certain of these credit derivatives are subject to collateral posting provisions these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes in the case of most of the multi sector cdo transactions the amount of collateral required is determined based on the change in value of the underlying cash security that represents the super senior risk layer subject to credit protection and not on the change in value of the super senior credit derivative as of july 31 2008 aigfp had received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps including those entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and those in respect of corporate debt clos at times valuation estimates made by certain of the counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference cdo securities for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by aigfp in connection with such instruments have differed significantly from aigfps estimates aig is unable to assess the effect if any that recent transactions involving sales of large portfolios of cdos will have on collateral posting requirements in almost all cases aigfp has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements some of which are for specified periods of time due to the ongoing nature of these collateral calls aigfp may engage in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences at any time as of july 31 2008 aigfp had posted collateral or had received collateral where offsetting exposures on other transactions resulted in the counterparty posting to aigfp based on exposures calculated in respect of super senior credit default swaps in an aggregate net amount of 16 5 billion valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes were considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio the unrealized market valuation losses of 26 1 billion recorded on aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio represents the cumulative change in fair value of these derivatives which represents aigs best estimate of the amount it would need to pay to a willing able and knowledgeable third party to assume the obligations under 121 american international group inc and subsidiaries aigfps super senior multi sector credit default swap portfolio as of june 30 2008 stress testing sensitivity analysis at june 30 2008 aig used a roll rate analysis to stress the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio for potential pre tax realized credit losses that it may incur if the multi sector cdo super senior credit default swap portfolio and the referenced obligations acquired by aigfp in extinguishing its obligations under the swaps are held to maturity credit losses represent an estimate of the potential shortfall of principal and or interest cash flows on the referenced obligations and credits underlying the portfolio that will not be recovered assuming the portfolio and referenced obligations are held to maturity two scenarios illustrated in this process resulted in potential pre tax realized credit losses of approximately 5 0 billion scenario a and approximately 8 5 billion scenario b actual ultimate realized credit losses are likely to vary perhaps materially from these scenarios and there can be no assurance that the ultimate realized credit losses related to the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with either scenario or that such realized credit losses will not exceed the potential realized credit losses illustrated by scenario b in prior quarters aig conducted risk analyses of the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio using certain ratings based static stress tests which centered around scenarios of further stress on the portfolio resulting from downgrades by the rating agencies from current levels on the underlying collateral in the cdo structures supported by aigfps credit default swaps during the first quarter of 2008 aig developed an additional methodology to conduct stress tests for potential realized credit losses from aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio that combined a roll rate estimate of the losses emanating from the subprime and alt a rmbs collateral securities in the multi sector cdos plus an estimate of losses arising from cdo securities inner cdos and other abs such as cmbs credit card and auto loan abs held by the cdos in conducting its risk analyses as of june 30 2008 aig discontinued use of the rating based static stress test and used only the roll rate stress test because it believes that the roll rate stress test provides a more reasonable analysis methodology to illustrate potential realized credit losses than the rating based static stress test used previously in the second quarter of 2008 aig stressed the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio using a roll rate analysis as applied to all rmbs collateral including subprime alt a and prime residential mortgages that comprise the subprime alt a and prime rmbs this analysis assumed that certain percentages of actual delinquent mortgages will roll into default and foreclosure it also assumed that certain percentages of non delinquent mortgages will become delinquent and default over time with those delinquency percentages depending on the age of the mortgage pool to those assumed defaults aig applied loss severities one minus recovery to derive estimated ultimate losses for each mortgage pool comprising a subprime alt a and prime rmbs because subprime alt a and prime rmbs have differing characteristics the roll rates and loss severities differed aig then estimated tranche losses from these roll rate losses by applying the pool losses up through the capital structure of the rmbs in this estimate of tranche losses aig introduced in the quarter an enhancement to the roll rate analysis to take into account the cash flow waterfall and to capture the potential effects both positive and negative of cash flow diversion within each cdo to these estimated subprime alt a and prime rmbs losses aig added estimated credit losses on the inner cdos and other abs such as cmbs credit card and auto loan abs calculated by using rating based static percentages in the case of inner cdos varying by vintage and type of cdo and in the case of other abs by rating in addition to the foregoing the analysis incorporates the effects of certain other factors such as mortgage prepayment rates excess spread and delinquency triggers the total of the roll rate losses and the losses on the inner cdos and other abs using two different scenarios of assumptions yielded estimated potential pre tax realized credit losses of approximately 5 0 billion and approximately 8 5 billion at march 31 2008 aigs credit based analyses estimated potential pre tax realized credit losses at approximately 1 2 billion to 2 4 billion the estimate of 2 4 billion was derived using the roll rate stress test described above the increase in the estimated potential realized credit loss illustrated by scenarios a and b was the result of both enhancements to the model and changes in the assumptions used the model was enhanced by inclusion of prime rmbs into the portfolio of securities subjected to the roll rate analysis and the introduction of analytics to capture the potential effects of the cash flow waterfall changes in assumptions included revisions to the roll rate percentages and loss severities on subprime and alt a mortgages in view of deteriorating real estate market conditions as well as a higher stress to other abs collateral and the use of current inner cdo ratings in the rating based static percentage the potential realized credit loss illustrated by scenario b is the result of applying different more highly stressed assumptions to the roll rate analysis model than those used in scenario a due to the dislocation in the market for cdo and rmbs collateral aig does not use the market values of the underlying cdo collateral in estimating its potential realized credit losses the use of factors derived from market observable prices in models used to determine the estimates for future realized credit losses could result in materially higher estimates of potential realized credit losses under the terms of most of these credit derivatives credit losses to aig would generally result from the credit 122 american international group inc and subsidiaries impairment of the referenced obligations that aig would acquire in extinguishing its swap obligations based upon its most current analyses aig believes that any credit losses which may emerge over time at aigfp will not be material to aigs consolidated financial condition but could be material to aigs liquidity other types of analyses or models could result in materially different estimates aig is aware that other market participants have used different assumptions and methodologies to estimate the potential realized credit losses on aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio resulting in significantly higher estimates than those resulting from aigs roll rate stress testing scenarios actual ultimate realized credit losses are likely to vary perhaps materially from aigs roll rate stress testing scenarios and there can be no assurance that the ultimate realized credit losses related to the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with either scenario or that such realized credit losses will not exceed the potential realized credit losses illustrated by scenario b the potential realized credit losses illustrated in scenarios a and b are lower than the fair value of aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio a net loss of 26 1 billion at june 30 2008 the net loss represents aigs best estimate of the amount it would need to pay to a willing third party to assume the obligations under aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the fair value of aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio is based upon fair value accounting principles which rely on third party prices for both the underlying collateral securities and the cdos that aigfps super senior credit default swaps wrap these prices currently incorporate liquidity premiums risk aversion elements and credit risk modeling which in some instances may use more conservative assumptions than those used by aig in its roll rate stress testing due to the ongoing disruption in the u s residential mortgage market and credit markets and the downgrades of rmbs and cdos by the rating agencies the market continues to lack transparency around the pricing of these securities these prices are not necessarily reflective of the ultimate potential realized credit losses aigfp could incur in the future related to the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio and aig believes they incorporate a significant amount
