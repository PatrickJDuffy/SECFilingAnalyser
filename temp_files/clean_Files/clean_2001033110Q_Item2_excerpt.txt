million or 27 5 percent in 2001 over 2000 personal lines net premiums written increased 5 5 percent or 33 million in the first three months of 2001 over 2000 the growth in 2001 primarily resulted from an increase in the number of policies issued with respect to preferred standard and non standard auto risks and increased rates growth of 1 6 percent and 0 3 percent for foreign general insurance net premiums written and net premiums earned respectively in the first three months of 2001 over 2000 reflect growth of operations in the united kingdom continental europe and the far east foreign general insurance operations produced 30 1 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in the first three months of 2001 and 34 0 percent in 2000 in comparing the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of aig foreign general operations during the first three months of 2001 to those foreign currency exchange rates used to translate aig foreign general results during the same period of 2000 the u s dollar strengthened in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly when foreign net premiums written were translated into u s dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 2 2 percentage points less than they would have been if translated utilizing those foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during that same period of 2000 because of the nature and diversity of aig operations and the continuing rapid changes in the insurance industry worldwide together with the factors discussed above it is difficult to assess further or project future growth in aig net premiums written and reserve for losses and loss expenses net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as 11 page 13 net premiums earned until the end of the policy period aig along with most general insurance entities uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance the loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss the statutory general insurance ratios were as follows data table removed 25 lines table aig believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company underwriting profit is measured in two ways statutory underwriting profit and generally accepted accounting principles gaap underwriting profit statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting differs from gaap as statutory accounting requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes all expenses most specifically acquisition expenses are recognized immediately not consistent with the revenues earned a basic premise of gaap accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the principle of matching therefore to convert underwriting results to a gaap basis acquisition expenses are deferred and recognized together with the related revenues accordingly the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by gaap thus adjusted underwriting profit is a gaap measurement which can be viewed as gross margin or an intermediate subtotal in calculating operating income and net income a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit exclusive of investment income if underwriting is not profitable losses incurred are a major factor the result is that the premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses and produce a profit therefore investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses if assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods an insurance company cannot survive for these reasons aig views and manages its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations the adjusted underwriting profits were 256 million in the first three months of 2001 and 212 million in the same period of 2000 domestic adjusted underwriting profit increased primarily as a result of the disciplined underwriting of dbg the regulatory product type and competitive environment as well as the degree of litigation activity in any one country varies significantly these factors have a direct impact on pricing and consequently profitability as reflected by adjusted underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios aig results reflect the net impact of incurred losses from catastrophes approximating 18 million and 25 million in the first three months of 2001 and 2000 respectively aig gross incurred losses from catastrophes approximated 58 million and 89 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively the impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from period to period making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult the pro forma table below excludes catastrophe losses in order to present comparable results of aig recurring core underwriting operations the pro forma 12 page 14 consolidated statutory general insurance ratios would be as follows data table removed 11 lines table aig historic ability to maintain its combined ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of aig foreign general insurance operations and aig emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting especially in the domestic specialty markets in addition aig does not seek net premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures general insurance net investment income in the first three months of 2001 increased 7 9 percent when compared to the same period of 2000 the growth in net investment income in 2001 was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment the new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein general insurance realized capital losses were 21 million in the first three months of 2001 and realized capital gains were 12 million in 2000 these realized capital gains and losses resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities general insurance operating income in the first three months of 2001 increased 7 3 percent when compared to the same period of 2000 the contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change was 41 9 percent in 2001 compared to 44 5 percent in 2000 aig is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations aig is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs aig insures risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide aig the level of reinsurance protection that aig desires these reinsurance arrangements do not relieve aig from its direct obligations to its insureds aig general reinsurance assets amounted to 23 78 billion and resulted from aig reinsurance arrangements thus a credit exposure existed at march 31 2001 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse aig under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements aig manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and when necessary aig holds substantial collateral in the form of funds securities and or irrevocable letters of credit this collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis at december 31 2000 approximately 43 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers in order to obtain statutory recognition nearly all of these balances were collateralized the remaining 57 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 95 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated a excellent or better as rated by a m best this rating is a measure of financial strength the terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories not creditworthiness through march 31 2001 these distribution percentages have not significantly changed aig allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance has not significantly changed from december 31 2000 when aig had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating 76 million at that date aig had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled e g liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction aig reinsurance security department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic such assessments include but are not limited to identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates this department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral in addition aig credit risk committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer aig enters into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for its general and life operations 13 page 15 aig enters these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among various legal entities these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation at march 31 2001 the consolidated general reinsurance assets of 23 78 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of 3 74 billion and 15 70 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses including ceded losses incurred but not reported ibnr ceded reserves the ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments therefrom are reflected in income currently it is aig belief that the ceded reserves at march 31 2001 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable in the future as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded at march 31 2001 general insurance reserves for losses and loss expenses loss reserves amounted to 40 72 billion these loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including ibnr and loss expenses and amounts of discounting related to certain workers compensation claims at march 31 2001 general insurance net loss reserves increased 63 million from prior year end to 25 01 billion the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently it is management belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at march 31 2001 in the future if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations in a very broad sense the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups one group being long tail casualty lines of business such lines include excess and umbrella liability directors and officers liability professional liability medical malpractice general liability products liability and related classes these lines account for approximately one half of net losses and loss expenses the other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines certain classes of casualty lines and includes personal lines estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses net losses for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors including the line and volume of the business involved in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses that is a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid a relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be ibnr a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines these methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next for the majority of long tail casualty lines net loss trend factors approximated four percent loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation thus many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs therefore aig carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business in the evaluation of aig net loss reserves loss trend factors vary slightly depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted as appropriate to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines for example if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property the growth in the property exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased 14 page 16 for other property and short tail casualty lines the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next the concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines aig continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste hazardous substances and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years aig has established a specialized claims unit which investigates and adjusts all such asbestos and environmental claims commencing in 1985 standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage however aig currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process these asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage the current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future additionally the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the government refusal to release parties the cleanup cost exposure may significantly change if potential congressional reauthorization of superfund dramatically changes the current program in the interim aig and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues at the current time it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage as they have in the past as well as by the changes in superfund and waste dump site coverage issues although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims the reserves carried for these claims at march 31 2001 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law furthermore as aig net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves in the future if the environmental claims develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations see the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein the majority of aig exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages not primary coverages thus the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves that is litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability aig incurs individual significant claim liabilities where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable are established on a case basis a summary of reserve activity including estimates for applicable ibnr relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined at march 31 2001 and 2000 was as follows data table removed 31 lines table 15 page 17 data table removed 20 lines table the gross and net ibnr included in the aforementioned reserve for losses and loss expenses at march 31 2001 and december 31 2000 were estimated as follows in millions data table removed 11 lines table a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity for the three month periods ended march 31 2001 and 2000 was as follows data table removed 33 lines table a m best an insurance rating agency has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that company current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments this is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years therefore the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments the higher the ratio the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments these ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments it should be noted however that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio the developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments court orders covered claims with no coverage defenses state mandated cleanup costs claims where aig coverage defenses are minimal and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting also aig considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary aig believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio the special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages aig asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites as a result aig reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies aig survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average pay 16 page 18 ment these ratios at march 31 2001 and 2000 were as follows data table removed 15 lines table aig operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states as a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state aig generally records these assessments upon notice additionally certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a company future premium tax liabilities therefore the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated the guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2000 were 15 million based upon current information aig does not anticipate that its net assessment will be significantly different in 2001 aig is also required to participate in various involuntary pools principally workers compensation business which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets this participation is also recorded upon notification as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated life

respectively the traditional life products particularly individual life products were major contributors to the growth in foreign premium income these tradi 17 page 19 tional life products coupled

approximately 5 7 percentage points less than it would have been if translated utilizing exchange rates prevailing in 2000 life insurance net investment income increased 14 9 percent during the first three months of 2001 the growth in net investment income was primarily attributable to both foreign and domestic new cash flow for investment the new cash flow was generated from life insurance operations and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein life insurance realized capital losses for the first three months were 18 million in 2001 and 29 million in 2000 these realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing management of the life insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities life insurance operating income during the first three months of 2001 increased 19 8 percent to 939 million excluding realized capital losses from life insurance operating income the percent increase would be 17 8

three months of 2001 compared to 39 3 percent in the same period of 2000 the risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk the risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is investment risk underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality morbidity termination and expenses aig life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately one million dollars of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance the investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets primarily long term fixed rate investments being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments to minimize its exposure to investment risk aig tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit if a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur a demand could be placed upon liquidity see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aig foreign operations as it has been throughout aig history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities for example in japan and several southeast asia territories the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities at december 31 2000 the average duration of the investment portfolio in japan was 6 0 years additionally there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities the anticipated average period for the receipt and investment of these future premium receipts is 6 1 years these durations compare with an estimated average duration of 10 4 years for the corresponding policy liabilities these durations have not changed significantly 18 page 20 during 2001 to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts without sacrificing investment quality to the extent permitted under local regulation aig may invest in qualified longer term securities outside japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield aig is able to manage any asset liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network see also the discussion under liquidity herein aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool to determine the composition of the invested assets and marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to

significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to aig parent these barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds aig insurance operations are exposed to market risk market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques one such technique is value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability aig believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management aig has performed a var analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of aig insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment in this analysis financial instrument assets include the domestic and 26 page 28 foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses reserve for unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders funds due to the nature of each insurance segment aig manages the general and life insurance operations separately as a result aig manages separately the invested assets of each accordingly the var analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aig insurance segments as of march 31 2001 and december 31 2000 aig methodology for calculating var and the results of the calculations presented herein were performed using historical simulation using historical simulation over the delta normal approach does not significantly change the results of this disclosure the historical simulation methodology entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period in this case the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios for each scenario each transaction was re priced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the final var number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence i e only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure a one month holding period was assumed in computing the var figure the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of

is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates as of march 31 2001 and december 31 2000 aig statistically measured the aforementioned loss of fair value through the application of a var model in this analysis the net fair value of ilfc was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt the estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of ilfc using the variance covariance delta normal methodology this calculation also used daily historical interest rates for the two years ending march 31 2001 and december 31 2000 the var model estimated the volatility of each of these interest rates and the correlation among them the yield curve was constructed using eleven key points on the curve to model possible curve movements thus the var measured the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to the calculated interest rate exposures these sensitivities were then applied to a database which contained the historical ranges of movements in interest rates and the correlation among them the results were aggregated to provide a single amount that depicts the maximum potential loss in fair value of a confidence level of 95 percent for a time period of one month as of march 31 2001 and december 31 2000 the var with respect to the aforementioned net fair value of ilfc was approximately 13 million and 11 million respectively aigfp derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available aigfp reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps trading securities options forwards and futures the estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows these transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if aigfp were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that the impact of any such limited liquidity would not be significant to aig financial condition or its overall liquidity see also the discussion under

exposed to potential changes in volatility interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions aig philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried credit risk exposure is separately managed see the discussion on the management of credit risk below aig market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aig market exposures particularly those market exposures of aigfp and aigtg this department determines whether aig market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aig senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and the shape and slope of the yield curve aigfp hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing u s and foreign government obligations aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility

reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions including equity swaps and options and purchasing u s and foreign government obligations aigfp does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction rather aigfp takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure aigfp values its portfolio at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of aigfp transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfp and aig management aigfp evaluates the portfolio discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors based upon this evaluation aigfp determines what if any offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio the aforementioned estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models these models utilize among other things current interest foreign exchange and volatility rates these valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio as described above in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio additionally depending upon the changes in interest rates and other market movements during the day the system will produce reports for management consideration for intra day offsetting positions overnight the system generates reports which recommend the types of offsets management should consider for the following day additionally aigfp operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day thus the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored reviewed and coordinated around the clock therefore offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any aigfp office in the world as part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk aigfp applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio in addition to the daily monitoring aigfp senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges this review includes an examination of the portfolio risk measures such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables aigfp management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets this management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio 30 page 32 all of aigtg market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes the fair values of aigtg financial

two or more parties whose returns are linked to or derived from some underlying equity debt commodity or other asset liability or index derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities certain commodities or financial or commodity indices the more significant types of derivative arrangements in which aig transacts are swaps forwards futures options and related instruments the most commonly used swaps are interest rate swaps currency swaps equity swaps and swaptions such derivatives are traded over the counter an interest rate swap is a contract between two parties to exchange interest rate payments typically a fixed interest rate versus a variable interest rate calculated on a notional principal amount for a specified period of time the notional amount is not exchanged currency and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps but may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the commencement and termination of the swap swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction a futures or forward contract is a legal contract between two parties to purchase or sell at a specified future date a specified quantity of a commodity security currency financial index or other instrument at a specified price a futures contract is traded on an exchange while a forward contract is executed over the counter over the counter derivatives are not transacted in an exchange traded environment the futures exchanges maintain considerable financial requirements and surveillance to ensure the integrity of exchange traded futures and options an option contract generally provides the option purchaser with the right but not the obligation to buy or sell during a period of time or at a specified date the underlying instrument at a set price the option writer is obligated to sell or buy the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise his right the option writer receives a nonrefundable fee or premium paid by the option purchaser options may be traded over the counter or on an exchange derivatives are generally either negotiated over the counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on an exchange standardized exchange traded derivatives include futures and options which can be readily bought or sold over recognized security or commodity exchanges and settled daily through such clearing houses negotiated over the counter derivatives include forwards swaps and op 32 page 34 tions over the counter derivatives are generally not traded like exchange traded securities and the terms of over the counter derivatives are non standard and unique to each contract however in the normal

counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices generally derivatives are used by aig customers such as corporations financial institutions multinational organizations sovereign entities government agencies and municipalities for example a futures forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations a counterparty may default on any obligation to aig including a derivative contract credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has an estimated positive fair value to help manage this risk the credit departments of aigfp and aigtg operate within the guidelines of the aig credit risk committee which sets credit policy and limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings in addition to credit ratings this committee takes into account other factors including the industry and country of the counterparty transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the aig credit risk committee it is also aig policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary aigfp and aigtg determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations if it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement then one or more enhancement techniques will be used examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit guarantees collateral credit triggers and credit derivatives and margin agreements a significant majority of aigfp transactions are contracted and documented under isda master agreements management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set off in the event of default also under such agreements in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity aigfp may be permitted to set off its receivables from that counterparty against aigfp payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions excluding regulated exchange transactions aigtg whenever possible enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above the following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of aigfp and aigtg derivatives transactions at march 31 2001 and december 31 2000 the notional amounts used to express the extent of aigfp and aigtg involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of aigfp and aigtg swaps business notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received except for certain contracts such as currency swaps the timing and the amount of cash flows relating to aigfp and aigtg foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements the net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to aigfp or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies netting under isda master agreements and applying collateral held prior to the application of these credit enhancements the gross credit risk with respect to these derivative instruments was 47 9 billion at march 31 2001 and 33 4 billion at december 31 2000 subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate currency and equity swaps swaptions and forward commitments approximated 10 98 billion at march 31 2001 and 9 51 billion at december 31 2000 the net replacement value for futures and forward contracts approximated 307 million at march 31

businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment thus exchange gains or losses occur when aig foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the u s dollar from one reporting period to the next aig through its foreign exchange operating committee evaluates each of its worldwide consolidated foreign currency net asset or liability positions and manages aig translation exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rates aig may use forward exchange contracts and purchase options where the cost of such is reasonable and markets are liquid to reduce these exchange translation exposures the exchange gain or loss with respect to these hedging instruments is recorded on an accrual basis as a component of comprehensive income in capital funds as an end user aig and its subsidiaries including its insurance subsidiaries use derivatives to aid in managing aig foreign exchange translation exposure derivatives may also be used to minimize certain exposures with respect to aig debt financing and its insurance operations to date such activities have not been significant aig has formed a derivatives review committee this committee with certain exceptions provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction the committee examines among other things the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction its potential credit exposure if any and the estimated benefits this committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by aigfp and aigtg for their own accounts legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability through legal or judicial processes of the obligations of aig clients and counterparties including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations see also the discussion on master netting agreements above aig seeks to eliminate or minimize such uncertainty through continuous consultation with internal and external legal advisors both domestically and abroad in order to understand the nature of legal risk to improve documentation and to strengthen transaction structure 36 page 38 accounting standards in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in june 2000 fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 138 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133 collectively fasb 133 fasb 133 requires aig to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value the financial statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors including the intended use of the derivative and the extent to which the derivative is effective as part of a hedge transaction the changes in fair value of the derivative transactions of aigfp and aigtg are currently presented in all material respects as a component of aig operating income the discussion below relates to the derivative activities of aig other than those of aigfp and aigtg on the date the derivative contract is entered into aig designates the derivative as 1 a hedge of the subsequent changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge 2 a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge or 3 a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation fair value and cash flow hedges may involve foreign currencies foreign currency hedges the gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated qualifies and is highly effective as a fair value hedge is recorded in current period earnings along with the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk the gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated qualifies and is highly effective as a cash flow hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows the gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated qualifies and is highly effective as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments account within other comprehensive income changes in the fair value of derivatives used for other than the above hedging activities are reported in current period earnings aig documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions aig also assesses both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items aig adopted fasb 133 on january 1 2001 in accordance with the transition provisions of fasb 133 aig recorded in its first quarter 2001 consolidated income statement a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment loss of 6 million this loss represents the net fair value of all previously unrecorded derivative instruments as of january 1 2001 net of tax and after the application of hedge accounting aig also recorded in its first quarter of 2001 consolidated statement of comprehensive income a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of 179 million this gain represents the increase in other comprehensive income net of taxes arising from recognizing the fair value of all derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments
