for the three month periods ending march 31 2000 and 1999 were as follows in millions data table removed 21 lines table during the latter part of 1999 the commercial insurance market continued to experience some rate 10 page 12 increases however this market remains competitive and excessively capitalized dbg continued to monitor its operations canceling non renewing or losing business where underwriting and pricing standards could not be achieved during the first three months of 2000 dbg declined to renew 110 million of business dbg has been able to sustain some growth in various specialty markets such as pollution excess liability and risk management where aig provides cost effective coverages for large complex risks underwriting flexibility and creative risk financing solutions excluding non renewed business as well as risk finance operations dbg net premiums written increased approximately 10 percent as reflected in the preceding table showing the distribution of net premiums written and net premiums earned domestic growth was primarily achieved through the growth in the personal auto insurance segment of personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased 122 million in the first three months of 2000 over the same period of 1999 the increase was related to the significant growth in the number of policies issued with respect to the preferred standard and non standard auto risks growth of 7 6 percent and 9 8 percent for foreign general insurance net premiums written and net premiums earned respectively in the first three months of 2000 over 1999 reflects growth of operations in the united kingdom and the far east foreign general insurance operations produced 35 2 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in the first three months of 2000 and 34 1 percent in 1999 differences in foreign exchange rates during 2000 relative to 1999 had a negligible effect on foreign general insurance net premiums written when translated from original currencies into u s dollars see also the discussion under capital resources herein because of the nature and diversity of aig operations and the continuing rapid changes in the insurance industry worldwide together with the factors discussed above it is difficult to assess further or project future growth in aig net premiums written and reserve for losses and loss expenses net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period aig along with most general insurance entities uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance the loss ratio is derived as the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is derived as statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss the statutory general insurance ratios were as follows data table removed 25 lines table aig believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company underwriting profit is measured two ways statutory underwriting profit and generally accepted accounting principles gaap underwriting profit statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting differs from gaap as statutory accounting requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes all expenses most specifically acquisition 11 page 13 expenses are recognized immediately which is not consistent with the revenues earned a basic premise of gaap accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the principle of matching therefore to convert underwriting results to a gaap basis acquisition expenses are deferred and recognized together with the related revenues accordingly the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by gaap thus adjusted underwriting profit is a gaap measurement which can be viewed as gross margin or an intermediate subtotal in calculating operating income and net income a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit exclusive of investment income if underwriting is not profitable losses incurred are a major factor the result is that the premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses and produce a profit therefore investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses if assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods an insurance company cannot survive for these reasons aig views and manages its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations the adjusted underwriting profits were 212 million in the first three months of 2000 and 193 million in the same period of 1999 the regulatory product type and competitive environment as well as the degree of litigation activity in any one country varies significantly these factors have a direct impact on pricing and consequently profitability as reflected by adjusted underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios aig results reflect the net impact of incurred losses from catastrophes approximating 25 million in the first three months of 2000 aig gross incurred losses from catastrophes approximated 89 million in 2000 there were no catastrophe losses in the first three months of 1999 if catastrophes were excluded from the losses incurred the pro forma consolidated statutory general insurance ratios would be as follows data table removed 11 lines table aig presents calculations of general insurance ratios which exclude catastrophe losses because the impact of catastrophes can fluctuate widely from period to period making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult thus the pro forma results are comparable and allow the reader to focus on the results of aig core business underwriting aig historic ability to maintain its combined ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of aig foreign general insurance operations and aig emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting especially in the domestic specialty markets in addition aig does not seek net premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures general insurance net investment income in the first three months of 2000 increased 7 0 percent when compared to the same period of 1999 the growth in net investment income in 2000 was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment the new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein general insurance realized capital gains were 12 million in the first three months of 2000 and 78 million in 1999 these realized gains resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities general insurance operating income in the first three months of 2000 decreased 0 5 percent when compared to the same period of 1999 the contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes and minority interest was 44 5 percent in 2000 compared to 49 5 percent in 1999 aig is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations aig is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs aig insures risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide aig the level of reinsurance protection that aig 12 page 14 desires these reinsurance arrangements do not relieve aig from its direct obligations to its insureds aig general reinsurance assets amounted to 19 39 billion and resulted from aig reinsurance arrangements thus a credit exposure existed at march 31 2000 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse aig under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements aig manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and when necessary aig holds substantial collateral in the form of funds securities and or irrevocable letters of credit this collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis at december 31 1999 approximately 50 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers in order to obtain statutory recognition nearly all of these balances were collateralized the remaining 50 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 95 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated a excellent or better as rated by a m best this rating is a measure of financial strength the terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories not creditworthiness through march 31 2000 these distribution percentages have not significantly changed aig allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance has not changed significantly from december 31 1999 when aig had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating 78 million at that date and prior to this allowance aig had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled e g liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction aig reinsurance security department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic such assessments include but are not limited to identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates this department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral in addition aig credit risk committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer aig enters into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for its general and life operations aig enters these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among various legal entities these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation at march 31 2000 the consolidated general reinsurance assets of 19 39 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of 2 66 billion and 13 66 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses including ceded losses incurred but not reported ibnr ceded reserves the ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments therefrom are reflected in income currently it is aig belief that the ceded reserves at march 31 2000 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable in the future as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded at march 31 2000 general insurance reserves for losses and loss expenses loss reserves amounted to 38 29 billion these loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including ibnr and loss expenses and amounts of discounting related to certain workers compensation claims at march 31 2000 general insurance net loss reserves increased 22 million to 24 62 billion the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently it is management belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at march 31 2000 in the future if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on such future results of operations 13 page 15 in a very broad sense the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups one group being long tail casualty lines of business such lines include excess and umbrella liability directors and officers liability professional liability medical malpractice general liability products liability and related classes these lines account for approximately one half of net losses and loss expenses the other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines certain classes of casualty lines and includes personal lines estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses net losses for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors including the line and volume of the business involved in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses that is a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid a relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be ibnr a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines these methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next for the majority of long tail casualty lines net loss trend factors approximated five percent loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation thus many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs therefore aig carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business in the evaluation of aig net loss reserves loss trend factors vary slightly depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted as appropriate to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines for example if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property the growth in property exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased for other property and short tail casualty lines the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next the concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines aig continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste hazardous substances and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years aig has established a specialized claims unit which investigates and adjusts all such asbestos and environmental claims commencing in 1985 standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage however aig currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process these asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage the current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future additionally the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the government refusal to release parties the cleanup cost exposure may significantly change if the congressional reauthorization of superfund dramatically changes thereby reducing or increasing litigation and cleanup costs additionally proposed legislation if passed in cur 14 page 16 rent form would be expected to reduce ultimate asbestos exposure in the interim aig and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues at the current time it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage as they have in the past as well as by the changes in superfund and waste dump site coverage issues although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims the reserves carried for these claims at march 31 2000 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law furthermore as aig net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves see the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein the majority of aig exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages not primary coverages thus the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves that is litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability aig incurs individual significant claim liabilities where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable are

best an insurance rating agency has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that company current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments this is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years therefore the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments the higher the ratio the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments these ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments it should be noted however that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio the developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments court orders covered claims with no coverage defenses state mandated cleanup costs claims where aig coverage defenses are minimal and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting also aig considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary aig believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio the special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages aig asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites as a result aig reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies aig survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at march 31 2000 and 1999 were as follows data table removed 15 lines table aig operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states as a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state aig generally records these assessments upon notice additionally certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a company future premium tax liabilities therefore the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated the guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 1999 were 15 million based upon current information aig does not anticipate that its net assessment will be significantly different in 2000 aig is also required to participate in various involuntary pools principally workers compensation business which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets this participation is also recorded upon notification as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated life insurance operations aig life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products traditional products consist of individual and group life annuity endowment and accident and health policies financial and

represented a 14 1 percent increase from the same period in 1999 foreign life operations produced 91 3 percent and 92 2 percent of the life premium income in 2000 and 1999 respectively the traditional life products particularly individual life products were major contributors to the growth in foreign premium income and resulting investment income particularly in those countries in which aia and nan shan operate a mixture of traditional accident and health and financial products are being sold in japan through alico differences in foreign exchange rates during 2000 relative to 1999 had a negligible effect on foreign life premium income when translated from original currencies into u s dollars life insurance net investment income increased 11 3 percent during the first three months of 2000 the growth in net investment income was primarily attributable to both foreign and domestic operations new cash flow for investment the new cash flow was generated from life insurance operations and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein life insurance realized capital losses were 29 million in 2000 and 21 million in 1999 these realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing management of the life insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities life insurance operating income during the first three

operating income to income before income taxes and minority interest amounted to 39 3 percent during the first three months of 2000 compared to 36 1 percent in the same period of 1999 the risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk the risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is investment risk 17 page 19 underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality morbidity termination and expenses aig life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately one million dollars of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance the investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets primarily long term fixed rate investments being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments to minimize its exposure to investment risk aig tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit if a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur a demand could be placed upon liquidity see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aig foreign operations as it has been throughout aig history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities for example in japan and several southeast asia territories the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities at december 31 1999 the average duration of the investment portfolio in japan was 5 6 years additionally there exists a future investment risk that is associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities with respect to the investment of these future premium receipts the average maturity is estimated to be 6 0 years these durations compare with an estimated average duration of 9 4 years for the corresponding policy liabilities these durations have not changed significantly during 2000 to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts without sacrificing investment quality to the extent permitted under local regulation aig may invest in qualified longer term securities outside japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield aig is able to manage any asset liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network domestically active monitoring assures appropriate asset liability matching as there are investments available to match the duration and the required yield see also the discussion under liquidity herein aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool to determine the composition of the invested assets and marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes financial services operations aig financial services subsidiaries engage in

realized capital losses in addition to the combined insurance pre tax operating cash flow aig insurance operations held 6 7 billion in cash and short term investments at march 31 2000 the aforementioned operating cash flow and the cash and short term balances held provided aig insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity this liquidity is available among other things to purchase high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate policy loans and collateral loans this cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately 11 billion from the maturities sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase

respect to fixed maturities aig general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer industry and or country concentrations with respect to general insurance aig strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase with respect to life insurance aig strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities see also the discussion under operational review life insurance operations herein the fixed maturities available for

been significant see also the discussion under derivatives herein in certain jurisdictions significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to aig parent these barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds aig insurance operations are exposed to market risk market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques one such technique is value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability aig believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management 25 page 27 aig has performed a var analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of aig insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment in this analysis financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses reserve for unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders funds due to the nature of each insurance segment aig manages the general and life insurance operations separately as a result aig manages separately the invested assets of each accordingly the var analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aig insurance segments as of december 31 1999 and december 31 1998 through march 31 2000 the economic facts and circumstances have not significantly changed therefore the var at december 31 1999 was representative of a var at march 31 2000 these calculations used the variance covariance delta normal methodology these calculations also used daily historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices in the two years ending december 31 1999 and december 31 1998 as applicable the var model estimated the volatility of each of these rates equity prices and the correlations among them for interest rates each country yield curve was constructed using eleven separate points on this curve to model possible curve movements inter country correlations were also used the redemption experience of municipal and corporate fixed maturities and mortgage securities was taken into account as well as the use of financial modeling thus the var measured the sensitivity of the asset and the liability portfolios of each of the aforementioned market exposures each sensitivity was estimated separately to capture the market exposures within each insurance segment these sensitivities were then applied to a database which contained both historical ranges of movements in all market factors and the correlations among them the results were aggregated to provide a single amount that depicts the maximum potential loss in fair value at a confidence level of 95 percent for a time period of one month at december 31 1999 and december 31 1998 the var of aig insurance segments was approximately 863 million and 760 million for general insurance respectively and 1 19 billion and 981 million for life insurance respectively the following table presents the var of each component of market risk for each of aig insurance segments as of december 31 1999 and december 31 1998 var with respect to combined

instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt the estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of ilfc using the variance covariance delta normal methodology this

market prices are not readily available aigfp reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps trading securities options forwards and futures the estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows these transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if aigfp were to sell or close out

unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were 40 million and 6 million respectively trading securities at market value and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time these securities are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of aigfp and aigtg the senior management of aig defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for aigfp and aigtg aig senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market operational and credit issues of aigfp and aigtg the senior managements of aigfp and aigtg report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with aig senior management 28 page 30 aig actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities in doing so aig must manage a variety of exposures including credit market liquidity operational and legal risks market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions aig philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried credit risk exposure is separately managed see the discussion on the management of credit risk below aig market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aig market exposures particularly those market exposures of aigfp and aigtg this department determines whether aig market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aig senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and the shape and slope of the yield curve aigfp hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing u s and foreign government obligations aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates aigfp hedges its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps options forwards and futures aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices which affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular stock a basket of stocks or a stock index aigfp reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions including equity swaps and options and purchasing u s and foreign government obligations aigfp does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction rather aigfp takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure aigfp values its portfolio at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of aigfp transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfp and aig management aigfp evaluates the portfolio discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors based upon this evaluation aigfp determines what if any offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio the aforementioned estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models these models utilize among other things current interest foreign exchange and volatility rates these valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio as described above in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio additionally depending upon the changes in interest rates and other market movements during the day the system will produce reports for management consideration for intra day offsetting positions overnight the system generates reports which recommend the types of offsets management should consider for the following day additionally aigfp operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day thus the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored reviewed and coordinated around the clock therefore offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any aigfp office in the world as part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk aigfp applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio in addition to the daily monitoring aigfp senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges this review includes an examination of the portfolio risk measures such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables aigfp management may 29 page 31 change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets this management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio all of aigtg market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes the fair values of aigtg financial instruments are exposed to market risk as a result of adverse market changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and adverse changes in the liquidity of the markets in which aigtg trades aigtg approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk aigtg expects to reduce aigtg senior management has established positions and stop loss limits for each line of business aigtg traders are required to maintain positions within these limits these positions are monitored during the day either manually and or through on line computer systems in addition these positions are reviewed by aigtg management reports which present each trading books position and the prior day profit and loss are reviewed by traders head traders and aigtg senior management based upon these and other reports aigtg senior management may determine to adjust aigtg risk profile aigtg attempts to secure reliable current market prices such as published prices or third party quotes to value its derivatives where such prices are not available aigtg uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions the methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates commodity prices volatility rates and other relevant factors a significant portion of aigtg business is transacted in liquid markets certain of aigtg derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices interest rates volatility levels and the effect of time though not indicative of the future past volatile market scenarios have represented profit opportunities for aigtg aigfp and aigtg are both exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a var model aig separately calculated the var with respect to aigfp and aigtg as aig manages these operations separately aigfp and aigtg asset and liability portfolios for which the var analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments derivative instruments and

not deemed necessary aig calculated the var with respect to aigfp and aigtg as of december 31 1999 and december 31 1998 through march 31 2000 the trading activities and exposures have not significantly changed therefore the var at december 31 1999 was representative of a var at march 31 2000 these calculations used the variance covariance delta normal methodology these calculations also used where appropriate for each entity daily historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity commodity prices in the two years ending december 31 1999 and december 31 1998 as applicable the var model estimated the volatility of each of these rates prices and the correlations among them for interest rates the yield curves of the united states and certain foreign countries were constructed using eleven separate points on each country yield curve to model possible curve movements inter country correlations were also used the redemption experience of corporate fixed maturities was taken into account thus the var measured the sensitivity of the asset and the liability portfolios of each of the market exposures each sensitivity was estimated separately to capture the market exposures within each entity these sensitivities were then applied to a database which contained both historical ranges of movements in all market factors and the correlations among them the results depict the maximum potential loss in fair value at a confidence level of 95 percent given the distinct business strategies at aigfp and aigtg the var calculations used different time periods to measure market exposures many of aigfp customized longer term contracts may require several days to transact and 30 page 32 hedge aig therefore used a one month holding period to measure market exposures for aigfp the large majority of aigtg contracts can be arranged and hedged within one day aig therefore used a one day holding period to measure market exposures at aigtg the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of aigfp and aigtg market risk as of december 31 1999 and december 31 1998 var with respect to combined operations cannot be

holding period was used to measure the market exposures of aigtg derivatives derivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties whose returns are linked to or derived from some underlying equity debt commodity or other asset liability or index derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities certain commodities or financial or commodity indices the more significant types of derivative arrangements in which aig transacts are swaps forwards futures options and related instruments the most commonly used swaps are interest rate swaps currency swaps equity swaps and swaptions such derivatives are traded over the counter an interest rate swap is a contract between two parties to exchange interest rate payments typically a fixed interest rate versus a variable interest rate calculated on a notional principal amount for a specified period of time the notional amount is not exchanged currency and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps but may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the commencement and termination of the swap swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction a futures or forward contract is a legal contract between two parties to purchase or sell at a specified future date a specified quantity of a commodity security currency financial index or other instrument at a specified price a futures contract is traded on an exchange while a forward contract is executed over the counter over the counter derivatives are not transacted in an exchange traded environment the futures exchanges maintain considerable financial requirements and surveillance to ensure the integrity of exchange traded futures and options an option contract generally provides the option purchaser with the right but not the obligation to buy or sell during a period of time or at a specified date the underlying instrument at a set price the option writer is obligated to sell or buy the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise his right the option writer receives a nonrefundable fee or premium paid by the option purchaser options may be traded over the counter or on an exchange derivatives are generally either negotiated over the counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on an exchange standardized exchange traded derivatives include futures and options which can be readily bought or sold over recognized security or commodity exchanges and settled daily through such clearing houses negotiated over the counter derivatives include forwards swaps and options over the counter derivatives are generally not traded like exchange traded securities and the terms of over the counter derivatives are non standard and unique to each contract however in the normal course of business with the agreement of the original counterparty these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty all significant derivatives activities are conducted through aigfp and aigtg permitting aig to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal in these derivative operations aig structures agreements which gen 31 page 33 erally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices generally derivatives are used by aig customers such as corporations financial institutions multinational organizations sovereign entities government agencies and municipalities for example a futures forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations a counterparty may default on any obligation to aig including a derivative contract credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has an estimated positive fair value to help manage this risk the credit departments of aigfp and aigtg operate within the guidelines of the aig credit risk committee which sets credit policy and limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings in addition to credit ratings this committee takes into account other factors including the industry and country of the counterparty transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the aig credit risk committee it is also aig policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary aigfp and aigtg determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations if it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement then one or more enhancement techniques will be used examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit guarantees collateral credit triggers and credit derivatives and margin agreements a significant majority of aigfp transactions are contracted and documented under isda master agreements that provide for legally enforceable set offs in the event of a default also under such agreements in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity aigfp may be permitted to set off its receivables from that counterparty against aigfp payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions excluding regulated exchange transactions aigtg whenever possible enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above the following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of aigfp and aigtg derivative transactions at march 31 2000 and december 31 1999 the notional amounts used to express the extent of aigfp and aigtg involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of aigfp and aigtg swaps business notional amount is not a
