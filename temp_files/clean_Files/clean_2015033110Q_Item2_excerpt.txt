unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 20 8 billion as of march 31 2015 from approximately 19 0 billion as of december 31 2014 due to a decline in interest

market and political conditions we continue to operate under difficult market conditions in 2015 characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates instability in the global markets and slowing growth in emerging markets china and euro zone economies interest rates remain low relative to historical levels which has affected our industry by reducing investment returns in addition current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines currency volatility in the first quarter of 2015 was particularly acute compared to the same period in the prior year as the three major foreign currencies that we transact in weakened considerably against the u s dollar such volatility affects line item components of income for those businesses having meaningful international operations in particular growth trends in net premiums written reported in u s dollars can differ significantly from those measured in

insurance strategic initiatives and outlook data table removed 77 table of contents item 2 executive overview market conditions and industry trends commercial insurance expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels currency volatility and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry commercial insurance has sought to modify terms and conditions grow profitable segments of the business exit unprofitable businesses and develop advanced data analytics to improve profitability property casualty property casualty has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges in the first quarter of 2015 the property casualty insurance industry experienced modest growth as a result of gross national product growth in the u s and an increase in overall exposures in certain markets property casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions since the second quarter of 2014 within the u s commercial property business property casualty observed continued rate pressure in the u s excess and surplus lines market particularly with respect to its natural catastrophe exposed business property casualty continues to differentiate

risks terrorism risk in our 2014 annual report mortgage guaranty during the first quarter of 2015 the u s market experienced an increase in mortgage loan originations primarily driven by a reduction in residential mortgage interest rates if reduced interest rates persist mortgage guaranty expects to benefit through increased volume driven by both refinancing activity for policies prior to 2012 and purchase volume mortgage guaranty also expects then prevailing low mortgage interest rates to have a favorable impact on the persistency of business written in 2012 and 2013 since refinancing those mortgages would be unattractive to homeowners who originated mortgages at the lower residential mortgage interest rates prevalent during that period mortgage guaranty also expects that newly reported delinquencies will continue to decline during 2015 mortgage guaranty believes the combination of the factors described above will result in favorable operating results for the remainder of 2015 on july 10 2014 the federal housing finance agency the conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac collectively the gses issued in draft form for public comment new eligibility requirements for private mortgage insurers that provide insurance on loans owned or guaranteed by them on april 17 2015 the final eligibility requirements were issued the new requirements which will be effective on december 31 2015 will mandate mortgage insurers to hold specified levels and types of assets in order to be able to pay a prescribed level of claims in certain stress scenarios mortgage guaranty will meet these requirements on the effective date these new requirements are not expected to have a material effect on aigs financial flexibility 78 table of contents item 2 executive overview

industry trends retirement increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading americans to seek financial security as they approach retirement which continues to drive demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features in addition higher tax rates and a desire for better investment returns have prompted less risk averse investors to seek products without guaranteed benefits providing the opportunity to further diversify our product portfolio by offering investment focused variable annuities the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on long term investment returns which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products in addition more highly leveraged competitors have entered the market offering higher crediting rates as long as the low interest rate environment continues conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased surrenders customers are however currently buying fixed annuities with longer surrender periods in pursuit of higher returns which may lessen the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment 80 table of contents item 2 executive overview in april 2015 the u s department of labor dol issued a proposed regulation that would if finalized in current form substantially expand the range of activities that would be considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code if finalized as proposed the investment related information and support that our advisors and employees could provide to erisa covered plan sponsors participants and ira holders on a non fiduciary basis could be substantially limited from what is allowed under current law this could have a material impact on the types levels and compensation structures of the investment products and services we provide we expect this proposal which supersedes a prior proposal issued by the dol in 2010 to generate substantial public comment it is too early to know whether or how any final regulation may be different from the proposal and any potential effect on our businesses is undeterminable at this time life populations are living longer and have increased needs for financial protection for beneficiaries estate planning and wealth creation the life operating segment addresses these needs with a broad spectrum of products ranging from the pure protection focus of term life to indexed universal life and investment oriented products such as variable universal life market factors primarily low interest rates and regulatory changes have caused the universal life market to shift its focus from guaranteed universal life to indexed universal life products that offer cash accumulation and living benefit options personal insurance the overall rate level has improved in the japanese and certain u s markets for auto personal property and accident and health products compared to prior years in japan car and home sales increased in the first quarter of 2014

of each operating unit the investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for non life insurance companies life insurance companies and aig parent including the dib the primary objectives are generation of investment income preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities investments highlights in the first quarter of 2015 a decrease in interest rates and narrowing of credit spreads resulted in net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 20 8 billion as of march 31 2015 from approximately 19 0 billion as of december 31 2014 we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in commercial mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income net investment income benefitted from positive performance on fixed maturity securities for which we elected the fair value option primarily driven by lower interest rates as well as income on alternative investments which continued to benefit from equity market performance blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called other than temporary impairments remained at low levels investment strategies investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification some of our key investment strategies are as follows fixed maturity securities held by the u s insurance companies included in non life insurance companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk return tax liquidity credit quality and diversification objectives outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by non life insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate while more of a focus is placed on asset liability matching in life insurance companies our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration to the extent practicable aig parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and duration aig parents liquidity sources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded intermediate term investment 114 table of contents item 2 investments grade rated fixed maturity securities based upon an assessment of its immediate

investment income recorded on these securities was 44 million and 76 million respectively 115 table of contents item 2 investments net investment income for the first quarter of 2015 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower reinvestment yields on our fixed maturity securities portfolio due to the low interest rate environment and lower income on alternative investments non life insurance companies for the non life insurance companies the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines as a result the investment strategy within the non life insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital subject to liability and other business considerations the non life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans while invested assets backing reserves of the non life insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields particularly in the domestic operations in addition we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate investments for their risk return attributes as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates this asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged we expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the non life insurance companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current riskreturn and tax objectives in addition the non life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio the non life insurance companies investment portfolio also includes to a lesser extent equity securities and other yield enhancing investments with respect to non affiliate overthecounter derivatives the non life insurance companies conduct business with highly rated counterparties and do not expect the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations under the contracts the non life insurance companies have controls in place to monitor credit exposures by limiting transactions with specific counterparties within specified dollar limits and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties periodically the non life insurance companies generally use isda master agreements and csas with bilateral collateral provisions to reduce counterparty credit exposures fixed maturity investments of the non life insurance companies domestic operations with an intermediate duration of 4 5 years are currently comprised primarily of tax exempt securities which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds government and agency bonds and corporate bonds the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings fixed maturity investments held in the non life insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings and short to intermediate duration averaging 3 3 years life insurance companies the investment strategy of the life insurance companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value subject to liquidity requirements capital constraints diversification requirements assetliability matching and available investment opportunities the life insurance companies use assetliability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses the life insurance companies fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities with the intent to largely match the characteristics of liabilities including duration which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities and as a result certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in 116 table of contents item 2 investments duration an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses the life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans in addition the life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields the life insurance companies investment portfolio also includes to a lesser extent equity securities and yield enhancing investments the life insurance companies monitor fixed income markets including the level of interest rates credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve the life insurance companies frequently review their interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for their new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment the low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price attractive guaranteed return products and puts margin pressure on existing products due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity in addition there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain inforce business specifically the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities fixed maturity investments of the life insurance companies domestic operations with an intermediate duration of 6 6 years are comprised of taxable corporate bonds as well as taxable municipal and government bonds and agency and nonagency structured securities the majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings fixed maturity investments held in the life insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings and intermediate to long duration averaging 12 8 years naic designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office svo of the national association of insurance companies naic evaluates the investments of u s insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called naic designations in general naic designations of 1 highest quality or 2 high quality include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade while naic designations of 3 through 6 generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities including non agency rmbs and cmbs which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies the following tables summarize the ratings distribution of life

reporting requirements as prescribed by the naic gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including estimates for ibnr and loss expenses less estimated salvage and subrogation and applicable discount the non life insurance companies regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in pretax operating income because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase prior years estimates of ultimate cost are

removed u s workers compensation the non life insurance companies discount certain workers compensation reserves in accordance with practices prescribed or permitted by new york pennsylvania and delaware new york rules generally do not permit non tabular discounting on ibnr and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to case reserves pennsylvania permits non tabular discounting of ibnr and commencing in 2013 approved variable discount rates determined using risk free rates based on the u s treasury forward yield curve plus a liquidity margin applicable to ibnr and case reserves delaware has permitted discounting on the same basis as the pennsylvania domiciled companies the net reduction in workers compensation discount in the first quarter of 2015 of 164 million is primarily due to the decline from fourth quarter 2014 in the rates used for discounting under the prescribed or permitted practices approximately 120 million of the decrease in the loss reserve discount is due to the decline in discount rates with treasury rates generally falling along the payout pattern horizon in the first quarter of 2015 a further reduction from the accretion of discount on reserves for accident years 2014 and prior was partially offset by the effects of the discount attributable to newly established reserves for accident year 2015 on january 1 2014 the non life insurance companies merged their two internal pooling arrangements into one pool and changed the participation percentages of the pool members resulting in a reallocation of reserves from new york domiciled companies to those domiciled in pennsylvania and delaware as a result of these changes in the participation percentages and domiciliary states of the participants of the combined pool the non life insurance companies recognized a discount benefit of 110 million in the first quarter of 2014 quarterly reserving conclusion aig net loss reserves represent our best estimate of the liability for net losses and loss adjustment expenses as of march 31 2015 while we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely in future years and materially exceed our loss reserves as of march 31 2015 in our opinion such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period

accident year by class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a large change either favorable or unfavorable as appropriate we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year as part of our reserving process we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues in the first quarter of 2015 the adverse prior year loss reserve development was 35 million which was driven by increased automobile claim severity in excess and primary casualty partially offset by property excluding natural catastrophes both domestically and internationally we recognized return premiums on loss sensitive business

claims filed under the nonaggregate premises or operations section of general liability policies the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection and the effect of prepackaged bankruptcies diverging legal interpretations and the difficulty in estimating the allocation of remediation cost among various parties with respect to environmental claims as described more fully in the 2014 annual report our reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect comprehensive groundup and top down analyses performed periodically in the first quarter of 2015 we increased our gross asbestos reserves by 7 million and our net asbestos reserves by 3 million primarily to reflect an increase in one account and accretion of discount there was no additional incurred loss for

down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due even under stress scenarios and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives we are focused on meeting the dibs liquidity needs including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the dib without relying on resources beyond the dib as part of this program management we may from time to time access the capital markets including issuing and repurchasing debt and selling assets on an opportunistic basis in each case subject to market conditions if the dibs risk target is breached we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the dibs liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under thenprevailing market conditions any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by aig parent from time to time we may utilize cash allocated to the dib that is not required to meet the risk target for the dib for general corporate purposes unrelated to the dib the dibs assets consist primarily of cash short term investments fixed maturity securities issued by corporations u s government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset backed securities the value of these assets is impacted by macroeconomic trends in u s and core european markets including corporate credit spreads commercial and residential real estate markets and to a lesser extent interest rates and foreign exchange rates among other factors the majority of these assets are carried at fair value the dibs liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other short term financing obligations the dib has both liabilities held at cost and liabilities held at fair value the liabilities held at fair value vary in price based on changes in aigs credit spreads as of march 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the dib had total assets of 13 2 billion and 15 1 billion respectively and total liabilities of 7 4 billion and 9 7

operating results collateral posted by operations included in the dib to third parties was 3 1 billion and 3 5 billion at march 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively this collateral primarily consists of securities of the u s government and government sponsored entities and generally cannot be repledged or resold by the counterparties global capital markets derivative transactions between aig and its subsidiaries and third parties are generally centralized through gcm specifically through aig markets gcm is required to clear certain derivatives transactions through central regulated clearing organizations pursuant to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank to the extent a derivatives transaction is subject to a clearing obligation gcm is required to post collateral in amounts determined by the relevant clearing organization and gcms clearing agreements with its futures commission merchants to the extent a derivatives transaction is not subject to a clearing obligation these derivative transactions are governed by bilateral master agreements the form of which is published by the international swaps and derivatives association inc isda many of these agreements primarily between gcm and third party financial institutions require collateral postings many of gcms transactions with aig and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements the purpose of which are to provide collateral to gcm which in turn is used to satisfy posting requirements with third parties including the margin requirements of clearing organizations and futures commission merchants in addition most of gcms cdss within aigfp are subject to collateral posting provisions the collateral posting provisions contained in the isda master agreements and related transaction documents with respect to cdss differ among counterparties and asset classes the amount of future collateral posting requirements for super senior cdss is a function of our credit ratings the rating of the relevant reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations with market value being the most significant factor we estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior cdss using various methodologies the contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions as of march 31 2015 and december 31 2014 gcm had total assets of 5 1 billion and 4 5 billion respectively and total liabilities of 3 9 billion and 3 1 billion respectively gcms assets consist primarily of cash short term investments other receivables net of allowance and unrealized gains on swaps options and forwards gcms liabilities consist primarily of unrealized losses on swaps options and forwards collateral posted by gcm to third parties was 2 9 billion and 3 0 billion at march 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively gcm obtained collateral from third parties totaling 1 9 billion and 1 1 billion at march 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively the collateral amounts reflect counterparty netting adjustments available under

of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers equity and commodity prices residential and commercial real estate values interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange inflation and their levels of volatility we are engaged in a variety of insurance investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk directly and indirectly we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets businesses on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off balance sheet exposures the chief risk officer within each business is responsible for properly identifying these risks then ensuring that they are appropriately measured monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the chief market risk officer cmro the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk taking authorities defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables distinct from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function risk identification market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad external predominantly market observable risks financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations financial condition liquidity and capital each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk equity prices we are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares investments in private equity hedge funds and mutual funds exchange traded funds and other equity linked capital market instruments as well as equity linked insurance products including but not limited to index annuities variable annuities universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance residential and commercial real estate values our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments changes in residential commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential commercial mortgages residential commercial mortgagebacked securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential commercial mortgages trusts that include residential commercial real estate and or mortgages and residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments interest rates interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and resulting product changes will generally reduce the attractiveness of our insurance products in the marketplace conversely higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons however when rates rise quickly there can be a temporary asymmetric u s gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value which is largely reported in other comprehensive income and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities financial liabilities insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities variable annuities and derivative contracts 158 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management credit spreads credit spreads measure an instruments risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration defaultfree instrument changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including but not limited to corporate bonds abs mortgage backed securities aig issued debt obligations credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments much like higher interest rates wider credit spreads mean more investment income in the longterm in the short term quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities which is largely reported in other comprehensive income a precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the creditworthiness of bond obligors potentially resulting in default losses foreign exchange fx rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income assets and liabilities denominated in and significant capital deployed in a variety of currencies changes in fx rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions commodity prices changes in commodity prices the value of commodities can affect the valuation of publiclytraded commodities commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices inflation changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including aig issued debt obligations derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly via indexing or implicitly through medical costs or wage levels risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures at the firmwide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aigs risk appetite statement this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels under specific stress tests at the market risk level the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis in addition we continue to enhance economic u s gaap accounting and statutory capitalbased risk measures at the market risk level businessunit level and firmwide levels this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures we use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities a one basis point increase in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities and a one percent increase in price on equity securities scenario analysis scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in worldwide equity markets scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses stress testing stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of rmbs or cmbs during 2008 159 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management market risk sensitivities the following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed a at march 31 2015 the analysis covered 291 9 billion of 309 4 billion interest rate sensitive assets excluded are 0 7 billion in dib assets 8 0 billion of loans and 3 8 billion of investments in life settlements in addition 5 0 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations at december 31 2014 the analysis covered 290 4 billion of 308 9 billion interest rate sensitive assets excluded are 0 8 billion in dib assets 8 4 billion of loans and 3 8 billion of investments in life settlements in addition 5 5 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations b includes our investments in picc group and picc p and c c the sensitivity calculation for aercap is based on our carrying value rather than the stock price as of the applicable date d the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag foreign currency denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated nonu s dollar assets less our consolidated nonu s dollar liabilities on a u s gaap basis we use a bottom up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level we manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency denominated debt issued by aig parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk including but not limited to the execution of cross currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt at the aig parent level we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits as a matter of general practice we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries however we may utilize either cross currency swaps or our foreign currency denominated debt as a net investment hedge of our capital in subsidiaries at march 31 2015 our five largest foreign currency net asset positions were denominated in british pounds canadian dollars euro hong kong dollars and japanese yen our foreign currency denominated net asset position at march 31 2015 increased by 10 2 percent or 1 2 billion compared to december 31 2014 the increase was mostly due to a 494 million increase in our british pound position primarily resulting from aig parent repurchasing outstanding british pound denominated debt a 160 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management 493 million increase in our hong kong dollar position primarily resulting from the non life insurance companies investment in picc p and c and a 91 million increase in our japanese yen position primarily resulting from debt hedging for illustrative purposes we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u s dollar the estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short term cash collateral or other financial obligations failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency reduced operating flexibility increased costs reputational harm and regulatory action aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash can be generated to meet the obligations as they come due aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a time horizon covering a period of up to one year we maintain a liquidity buffer designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions if we project that we will breach the tolerance we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions however the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements risk identification the following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short term financial obligations as they come due market monetization risk assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs cash flow mismatch risk discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls event funding risk additional funding is required as the result of a trigger event event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings a market event or some other event that created a funding obligation or limits existing funding options financing risk we are unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions aig specific issues or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding risk measurement comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk we produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows in addition we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity 161 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management we use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure including coverage ratios coverage ratios measure the adequacy of a portfolio of assets to meet the forecasted net cash flow over a specified time horizon the portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon asset ratios asset ratios measure and track the quality of an entitys assets that can be used to raise liquidity over a specified period of time cash flow forecasts cash flow forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon stress testing coverage ratios and asset ratios are re measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows liquid assets and or other funding sources relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to aig parent and business unit risk committees the frequency content and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity based on its complexity risk profile activities and size critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u s gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment data table removed
