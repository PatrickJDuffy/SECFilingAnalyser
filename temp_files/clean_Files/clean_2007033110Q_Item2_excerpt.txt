the information and discussion included in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aig presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful statutory loss ratios and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance filed with insurance regulatory authorities and used for analysis in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with aigs insurance competitors aig has also incorporated into this discussion cross references to additional information included in this quarterly report on form 10 q and in its 2006 annual report on form 10 k to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject overview of operations and business results aig identifies its reportable segments by product or service line consistent with its management structure aigs segments are general insurance life insurance and retirement services financial services and asset management aigs operations in 2007 and 2006 were conducted by its subsidiaries through these segments through these segments aig provides insurance financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions this geographic product and service diversification is one of aigs major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors aigs other category consists of items not allocated to aigs operating segments aigs subsidiaries serve commercial institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network in the united states aig companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and are among the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well aigs financial services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing capital markets operations and consumer finance both in the united states and abroad aig also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals as part of its spread based business activities aig issues various debt instruments in the public and private markets outlook the commercial property and casualty insurance industry has historically experienced cycles of price erosion followed by rate strengthening as a result of catastrophes or other significant losses that affect the overall capacity of the industry to provide coverage despite industry price erosion in commercial lines aig expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new general insurance businesses as a result of aigs broad product line and extensive distribution networks in the u s and abroad workers compensation remains under considerable pricing pressure as statutory rates continue to decline rates for excess casualty d and o and certain other lines of insurance also continue to decline due to competitive pressures there can be no assurance that price erosion will not become more widespread or that aigs profitability will not deteriorate from current levels in major commercial lines however aig seeks to mitigate this risk by constantly seeking out profitable opportunities across its diverse product lines and distribution networks in japan the national tax authority in cooperation with the life insurance association of japan is reviewing the tax treatment for increasing term life insurance which may affect the amount of premiums that qualify as tax deductions for business owners as a result of this review aigs life insurance companies in japan suspended the sale of increasing term life insurance and other corporate tax products from early april 2007 this action will have an adverse effect on life insurance sales aig companies in japan have taken several measures aimed at increasing sales of other products in the japanese market especially sales of u s dollar life insurance products in march 2007 the u s treasury department published proposed new regulations that if adopted in their current form would limit the ability of u s taxpayers to claim foreign tax credits in certain circumstances under the internal revenue code should the proposed regulations be adopted in their current form they would limit aigs ability to claim foreign tax credits in connection with certain structured transactions entered into by aigfp resulting in a material adverse effect on aigfps operating results the operating results of aigs consumer finance operations in the united states may be affected by further deterioration in the credit quality of loans originated to non

three months of 2006 accounting for 2 7 points of the improvement dbgs net premiums written increased 3 percent in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 due to the

increased 120 million on growth in the bond portfolio resulting from investment of operating cash flows and capital contributions income from partnership investments increased 155 million in the first

earned increased in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 due primarily to increased writings in domestic operations underwriting results were adversely affected by european windstorm losses only partially offset by lower adverse development for the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 resulting in an overall decline in statutory underwriting profit for the 2007 period operating income however increased in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 as increased net investment income and realized capital gains more than offset the decline in underwriting results personal lines results the modest increase in personal lines operating income in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 reflects a reduction in the loss ratio of 1 6 points favorable development of prior accident years reduced incurred losses by 29 million in the first three months of 2007 compared to a decrease of 19 million in the same period of 2006 accounting for 0 9 points of the decrease in the loss ratio the loss ratio for the first three months of 2007 also improved 0 7 points compared to the same period in 2006 primarily due to favorable loss trends and growth in the private client group partially offset by increased losses in 21st century the improvement in the loss ratio was partially offset by an increase in the expense ratio of 1 4 points primarily due to increased acquisition expenses by 21st century along with growth in the private client group investments in human resources and technology and lower average premiums the increase in net premiums written was driven by continued growth in the private client group 21st century and aig direct net premiums written grew modestly at 3 6 percent and 2 4 percent respectively while agency auto declined 8 4 percent mortgage guaranty results the significant decline in mortgage guaranty operating income in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 was due primarily to unfavorable loss experience in both the domestic first and second lien businesses as a result of the continued softening in the u s housing market losses on ugcs subprime business were not significant however the third party originated second lien product continued to perform poorly resulting in 61 million of losses incurred in the first quarter of 2007 ugcs consolidated loss ratio for the quarter was 92 2 compared to a loss ratio of 30 4 for the same period in 2006 prior year development increased incurred losses by 31 million in the first three months of 2007 compared to a reduction of 12 million in the first three months of 2006 accounting for 22 points of the increase in the loss ratio the downward cycle in the u s housing market is not expected to improve until residential inventories return to a more normal level and aig expects that this downward cycle will continue to adversely affect ugcs operating results for the foreseeable future net premiums written increased 35 percent in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the first quarter of 2006 as growth in the european markets resulted in a 189 percent increase in international premiums in addition second lien premiums increased 49 percent due to higher renewal premiums on the domestic second lien business although ugc discontinued accepting new business for the poorly performing third party originated second lien product in the fourth quarter of 2006 ugc will continue to receive renewal premiums on the existing portfolio for the life of the loans estimated to be three to five years the expense ratio of 21 7 in the first quarter of 2007 declined from 22 7 in the year ago quarter as premium growth offset expenses related to ugcs international expansion and additional operational resources in the second lien and private education loan businesses 36 american international group inc and subsidiaries foreign general insurance results foreign generals operating income increased in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 due to increases in net investment income and statutory underwriting profit and the effect of changes in the exchange rates of the euro and sterling net premiums written increased 17 percent 13 percent in original currency in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 reflecting growth in commercial and consumer lines driven by new business from both established and new distribution channels including a wholly owned insurance company in vietnam and central insurance co ltd in taiwan and by greater retention of commercial lines accounts on renewal consumer lines in latin america and commercial lines in europe the far east and the u k also contributed to the increase net premiums written by the lloyds syndicate ascot were essentially unchanged from the same period in 2006 as increased premiums due to rate increases were offset by decreased premiums due to loss of market share and higher reinsurance costs the loss ratio in the first three months of 2007 was essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2006 favorable loss development from prior accident years was relatively consistent in both periods the 2007 loss ratio was negatively affected by an increase in personal accident losses in the far east and an increase in severe but non catastrophic losses which were more than offset by reduced adverse development relating to the 2005 hurricanes the expense ratio was unchanged in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 the 2006 expense ratio reflected an out of period adjustment for amortization of deferred advertising costs which increased the first quarter 2006 expense ratio by 1 7 points the comparable increase in the expense ratio in 2007 resulted from growth in certain commercial lines which have higher acquisition expenses but historically lower loss ratios aig expects the expense ratio to increase during the remainder of 2007 as the consumer lines of business which have higher acquisition costs increase in significance as a component of net premiums written net investment income increased in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 due to higher interest and dividend income of 56 million as a result of increased cash flows higher interest rates and the compounding of previously earned and reinvested interest income net investment income also reflects increased equity mutual fund income of 52 million related to certain interests in unit investment trusts that aig began recognizing in the second quarter of 2006 as well as increased equity partnership income reserve for losses and loss expenses the following table presents the components of the general insurance gross reserve for losses and loss expenses loss reserves as of march 31 2007 and december 31 2006 by major line of business on a statutory annual statement basis a data table removed a presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners b allocations among various lines were revised from the previous presentation aigs gross reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development at march 31 2007 general insurance net loss reserves increased 1 40 billion from the prior year end to 64 03

overall general insurance net loss reserves reflects a loss reserve discount of 2 26 billion including tabular and non tabular calculations the tabular workers compensation discount is calculated using a 3 5 percent interest rate and the 1979 81 decennial mortality table the non tabular workers compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in new york and pennsylvania and follows the statutory regulations for each state for new york companies the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies own payout patterns for pennsylvania companies the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern for accident years 2002 and subsequent the discount is based on the yield of u s treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the companys own payout pattern with the future expected payment for each year using the interest rate associated with the corresponding treasury security yield for that time period the discount is comprised of the following 662 million tabular discount for workers compensation in dbg 1 30 billion non tabular discount for workers compensation in dbg and 300 million non tabular discount for other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence in airco the total undiscounted workers compensation loss reserve carried by dbg is approximately 11 8 billion as of march 31 2007 the other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business in airco that is assumed from dbg is discounted based on the yield of u s treasury securities ranging from one to twenty years and the dbg payout pattern for this business the undiscounted reserves assumed by airco from dbg totaled approximately 3 60 billion at march 31 2007 quarterly reserving process management believes that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover general insurance net losses and loss expenses as of march 31 2007 while aig regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of march 31 2007 in the opinion of management such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated 38 american international group inc and subsidiaries financial condition although it could have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the following table presents the reconciliation of net loss reserves data table removed the following tables summarize development favorable or unfavorable of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years other than accretion of discount data table removed data table removed in determining the quarterly loss development from prior accident years aig conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each profit center for example if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center as appropriate in the first quarter of 2007 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the first quarter of 2007 as part of its quarterly reserving process aig also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues such as those related to stock option backdating in the first three months of 2007 net loss development from prior accident years was favorable by approximately 131 million including approximately 36 million of adverse development pertaining to the major hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 and 18 million of adverse development from the general reinsurance operations of transatlantic and excluding approximately 116 million from accretion of loss reserve discount excluding catastrophes and transatlantic as well as accretion of discount net loss development in the first three months of 2007 from prior accident years was favorable by approximately 185 million the overall favorable development of 131 million consisted of approximately 265 million of favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2006 partially offset by approximately 134 million of adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior for the first three months of 2007 most classes of aigs business continued to experience favorable development for accident years 2003 through 2006 the adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior reflected development from excess casualty within dbg and from transatlantic this adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior in the first three months of 2007 pertaining to excess casualty and to transatlantic was significantly lower than the amounts of adverse development from these accident years observed during the first three months of 2006 in the first three months of 2006 net adverse loss development from prior accident years was approximately 35 million including approximately 98 million pertaining to catastrophes in 2004 and 2005 and 35 million from the general reinsurance operations of transatlantic but excluding approximately 101 million pertaining to accretion of loss reserve discount applicable to accident years 2005 and prior excluding catastrophes and transatlantic as well as accretion of discount net loss development from prior accident years in the first three months of 2006 was favorable by approximately 98 million the overall adverse development of 35 million consisted of approximately 285 million of favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2005 offset by approximately 320 million of adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior most classes of business throughout aig experienced favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2005 other than the adverse development of 98 million pertaining to the 2004 and 39 american international group inc and subsidiaries 2005 hurricanes the adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior was primarily attributable to excess casualty business within dbg and to transatlantic with a much smaller amount attributable to excess workers compensation business within dbg asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k aigs reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground up analysis in the first three months of 2007 aig maintained the ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims resulting from the recently completed reserve analyses a minor amount of favorable incurred loss development pertaining to

and environmental the table below presents aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at march 31 2007 and 2006 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the march 31 2007 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at march 31 2006 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments in addition aigs survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected in the first quarter of 2007 as a result of a large settlement many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at march 31 2007 and 2006 were as follows data table removed life insurance and

realized capital losses in the foreign life operations in 2007 included losses related to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and losses related to the decline in value of securities deemed to be other than temporary operating results in the first three months of 2007 includes a charge of 32 million as a result of the adoption of sop 05 1 which generally requires dac related to group contracts to be amortized over a shorter duration than in prior periods and also requires that dac be expensed at the time a policy is terminated and cannot be re capitalized if that policy is reinstated the effect of sop 05 1 was most significant to the group products line in the domestic life operations and was a significant factor in the decline of operating income for domestic life in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 the growth in domestic retirement services operating income in the first quarter of 2007 compared to the same period last year was driven by higher premiums and other considerations and lower realized capital losses although domestic retirement services had realized capital losses of 144 million in the first three months of 2006 compared to a loss of 9 million in the same period of 2007 the effect of those losses in 2006 was partially offset by a corresponding reduction of 26 million in amortization of dac in order to

realized capital gains in addition a 37 million provision including 25 million for personal accident for additional claim expense was established in japan as a result of a continuing industry wide regulatory review of claims that review is expected to be completed in late 2007 life insurance premiums and other considerations increased modestly in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 in japan increased fees and policy charges related to interest sensitive universal life and u s dollar life insurance products were partially offset by the runoff of the acquired

higher partnership income equity in unit investment trusts and growth in underlying invested assets life insurance operating income declined in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same

products in japan loss ratios remained stable for this business which continues to enjoy relatively high margins group products premiums and other considerations reflected growth for the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period last year primarily due to sales of credit and pension business in europe net investment income declined from first quarter 2006 primarily due to the decline in interest rates in brazil which adversely affected the pension business results operating income for the first quarter of 2007 declined from the same period last year primarily due to the decline in net investment income and lower realized capital gains individual fixed annuities premium and other considerations growth reflects higher surrender charges from u s dollar contracts in japan where a weak yen makes it attractive for certain policyholders to lock in foreign exchange gains in excess of surrender charges net investment income increased due to higher average investment yields and higher assets under management management implemented a new investment strategy during the quarter to enhance future investment yields which resulted in realized capital losses in the current quarter as a small portion of the existing bond portfolio was sold and reinvested in higher yielding assets the positive effect on operating income for the realized capital losses was 13 million primarily related to lower dac amortization operating income increased for the first three months of 2007 compared to the first three months of 2006 primarily due to growth in reserves and surrender charges individual variable annuity assets under management particularly in europe continued to grow due to new product offerings and stronger equity markets the fees generated from the growth in assets under management increased premiums and operating income for the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period last year net investment income grew in the first three months of 2007 compared to the

first three months of 2007 were up slightly from last years levels while the growth in operating income fell compared to the same period of 2006 net realized capital losses recorded in the current period compared to net realized capital gains recorded in the same period last year greatly influenced the low growth rate in total revenues and caused the decline in operating income the net realized capital losses recorded in the current period were driven primarily by the mark to market of derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 along with the write down of u s dollar bonds held in singapore and thailand where the decline in the value of those bonds when measured in the local currency was determined to be other than temporary premiums and other considerations grew in the current period reflecting a continued trend toward investment oriented products where only a portion of policy charges collected from policyholders are reported as premium net investment income grew in the current period in line with the growth in underlying invested assets higher income from interests in unit investment trusts and higher policyholder trading gains which are offset by an equal charge to incurred policy losses and benefits also contributed to the growth life insurance premiums and other considerations were flat in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 due to the shift in product mix from traditional life insurance products to investment oriented products as mentioned above net investment income grew in the current period compared to the same period of 2006 due primarily to the growth in the underlying invested assets and in part due to earnings on certain interests in unit investment trusts along with higher policyholder trading gains operating income decreased in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period last year due mainly to the change in net realized capital gains losses which

to foreign and domestic airlines revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for ilfcs own account and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and financial institutions ilfc finances its aircraft purchases primarily through the issuance of debt instruments ilfc economically hedges its floating rate and foreign currency denominated debt using interest rate and foreign currency derivatives these derivatives are effective economic hedges however since hedge accounting under fas 133 was not applied the benefits of using derivatives to hedge these exposures are not reflected in ilfcs corporate borrowing rates the composite borrowing rates at march 31 2007 and 2006 were 5 19 percent and 4 77 percent respectively ilfc has begun to apply hedge accounting in the second quarter of 2007 ilfc typically contracts to re lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term for aircraft returned before the end of the lease term ilfc has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return as a lessor ilfc considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent ilfc had one aircraft off lease at march 31 2007 and all new aircraft scheduled for delivery through 2007 have been leased aircraft leasing results ilfcs operating income decreased in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 by 12 million or 6 8 percent for the first three months of 2007 and 2006 the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 including the related foreign exchange gains and losses was 37 million and 45 million respectively in both revenues and operating income rental revenues increased by 142 million or 15 4 per 52 american international group inc and subsidiaries cent driven by a larger aircraft fleet increased utilization and higher lease rates during the first three months of 2007 ilfcs fleet subject to operating leases increased by 32 airplanes to a total of 856 the increase in rental revenues was partially offset by increases in depreciation expense and interest expense depreciation expense increased by 42 million or 11 5 percent in line with the increase in the size of the aircraft fleet interest expense increased by 71 million or 22 6 percent driven by rising cost of funds a weaker u s dollar against the euro and the british pound and additional borrowings to fund aircraft purchases as noted above ilfcs interest expense did not reflect the benefit of hedging these exposures capital markets capital markets represents the operations of aigfp which engages as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions including standard and customized financial products involving commodities credit currencies energy equities and rates aigfp also invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and principal investments and engages in borrowing activities involving issuing standard and structured notes and other securities and entering into gias beginning in 2007 aigfp applied hedge accounting under fas 133 to certain of its interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts hedging its investments and borrowings as a result aigfp recognized in earnings the change in the fair value on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks offsetting the gains and losses on the derivatives designated as hedges prior to 2007 aigfp did not apply hedge accounting under fas 133 to any of its derivatives or related assets and liabilities capital markets results capital markets operating income increased in the first three months of 2007 by 538 million compared to the same period of 2006 primarily due to differences in its accounting treatment for hedging activities in the first three months of 2007 aigfp began applying hedge accounting under fas 133 to certain of its interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts hedging its investments and borrowings as a result aigfp recognized in earnings the change in the fair value on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks offsetting the gains and losses on the derivatives designated as hedges in the first three months of 2007 aigfp recognized a net loss of 85 million related to hedging activities for which hedge accounting was not applied compared to a net loss of 678 million in the first three months of 2006 the net loss recognized for the first three months of 2007 included a 166 million reduction in fair value at march 31 2007 of certain derivatives that are an integral part of and economically hedge the structured transactions potentially affected by the proposed guidance by the u s treasury department discussed above in overview of operations and business outlook this valuation adjustment effectively reverses the cumulative gains resulting from movements in market interest rates on the derivatives since their inception through march 31 2007 while these derivatives were economically hedging the preferred interests in the structured transactions for accounting purposes the preferred interests were accounted for either at amortized cost or as available for sale debt securities accordingly no changes in market value on these securities have been recognized in income the net loss on aigfps derivatives recognized in the first three months of 2006 was partially due to an out of period charge of 300 million related to the remediation of the material weakness in accounting for certain derivative transactions under fas 133 the remainder of the net loss reflected the effect of increases in u s interest rates resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives hedging aigfps assets and liabilities the improved results in the first three months of 2007 were partially offset by reduced transaction flow in aigfps equity commodity and interest rate products financial market conditions in the first three months of 2007 were characterized by slight increases in global interest rates increases in credit spreads slightly higher equity valuations and a slightly weaker u s dollar the most significant component of capital markets operating expenses is compensation which was 123 million and 136 million in the first three months of 2007 and 2006 respectively the amount of compensation was not affected by gains and losses arising from derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 aig elected to early adopt fas 155 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments fas 155 in 2006 and aigfp elected to apply the fair value option to certain structured notes and other financial liabilities containing embedded derivatives outstanding as of january 1 2006 the cumulative effect of the adoption of fas 155 on these instruments at january 1 2006 was a pre tax loss of 29 million the effect of these hybrid financial instruments reflected in aigfps operating income in the first three months of 2007 and 2006 was a pre tax loss of 166 million and a pre tax gain of 9 million respectively these amounts were largely offset by gains and losses on economic hedge positions also reflected in aigfps operating income consumer finance aigs consumer finance operations in north america are principally conducted through american general finance inc agf effective january 2 2007 agf expanded its operations into the united kingdom through the acquisition of ocean finance and mortgages limited a finance broker for home owner loans in the united kingdom agf derives a substantial portion of its revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding real estate loans secured and un 53 american international group inc and subsidiaries secured non real estate loans and retail sales finance receivables the real estate loans are comprised principally of first lien mortgages on residential real estate generally having a maximum term of 360 months and are considered non conforming the real estate loans may be closed end accounts or open end home equity lines of credit and are principally fixed rate products agf does not offer mortgage products with borrower payment options that allow for negative amortization of the principal balance the secured non real estate loans are secured by consumer goods automobiles or other personal property both secured and unsecured non real estate loans and retail sales finance receivables generally have a maximum term of 60 months the majority of agfs originations is sourced through its branches however a significant volume of real estate loans is also originated through broker relationships and to lesser extents through correspondent relationships and direct mail solicitations agf also conducts mortgage banking activities through its centralized real estate operations it originates residential real estate loans the majority of which are sold to investors on a servicing released basis these loans are collateralized by first and second liens on one to four family properties and are originated largely through broker relationships and to a lesser extent are originated directly to consumers or through correspondent relationships from july 2003 through february 2006 these loans were originated through an arrangement with aig federal savings bank a federally chartered thrift the origination relationship was terminated in the first quarter of 2006 since then all new loans were originated directly by agf subsidiaries under their own state licenses aigs foreign consumer finance operations are principally conducted through aigcfg aigcfg operates primarily in emerging and developing markets aigcfg has operations in argentina china hong kong mexico philippines poland taiwan and thailand and most recently began operations in india through the acquisition of a majority interest in a sales finance lending operation in addition aigcfg expanded its distribution channels in thailand by acquiring in the first quarter of 2007 an 80 percent interest in a company with a network of over 130 branches for secured consumer lending certain of the aigcfg operations are partly or wholly owned by life insurance subsidiaries of aig accordingly the financial results of those companies are allocated between financial services and life insurance and retirement services according to their ownership percentages while products vary by market the businesses generally provide credit cards unsecured and secured non real estate loans term deposits savings accounts retail sales finance and real estate loans aigcfg originates finance receivables through its branches and direct solicitation aigcfg also originates finance receivables indirectly through relationships with retailers auto dealers and independent agents consumer finance results consumer finance operating income decreased by 140 million or 79 5 percent in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 included in operating income is the effect of hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 including the related foreign exchange gains and losses on the related hedged items of 36 million and 3 million in the first three months of 2007 and 2006 respectively the operating income for the first three months of 2007 from the domestic consumer finance operations which includes the operations of agf and aig federal savings bank decreased by 184 million or 93 percent from the same period of 2006 in light of evolving market and regulatory developments affecting non prime mortgage lending aigs domestic consumer finance operations are in ongoing discussions with the office of thrift supervision relating to loans originated in the name of aig federal savings bank during the period from the beginning of july 2003 to the beginning of may 2006 management expects that the application of underwriting criteria developed in consideration of regulatory guidance issued by the banking agencies will result in significant costs to the domestic consumer finance operations at this time managements best estimate of these costs is 128 million pre tax and a charge for this amount has been included in consumer finance operating income for the three months ended march 31 2007 first quarter domestic consumer finance revenues and operating income also declined from the prior year partially due to the change in fair value of the derivatives hedging borrowings for which hedge accounting was not applied during either period during the first three months of 2007 agf recorded a net loss of 36 million on its derivatives for which hedge accounting was not applied including the related foreign exchange losses compared to a net gain of 1 million for the same period of 2006 additionally for the first quarter of 2007 domestic results were adversely affected by the slower housing market higher interest rates on most long term fixed rate loans and evolving changes in the regulatory environment which resulted in lower real estate loan originations for the first three months of 2007 results from mortgage banking activities also included a 25 million increase in agfs warranty reserve which covers its obligations to repurchase loans sold to third party investors should there be a first payment default or breach of representations and warranties although mortgage loan originations declined in the first quarter of 2007 the softening of home price appreciation reducing the equity customers may be able to extract from their homes by refinancing and higher mortgage loan rates contributed to an increase in non real estate loans of 11 percent at march 31 2007 compared to march 31 2006 retail sales finance receivables also increased 23 percent compared to march 31 2006 due to increased marketing efforts and customer demand agfs results for the first three 54 american international group inc and subsidiaries months of 2007 also included 65 million from a favorable out of court settlement the credit quality of agfs finance receivables during the first three months of 2007 remained stable its net charge off ratio increased to 0 97 percent compared to 0 88 percent in the same period in 2006 which reflected 6 million of non recurring recoveries that were recorded in the first quarter of 2006 agfs delinquency ratio remained relatively low although it increased by 31 basis points to 2 05 percent at march 31 2007 compared to march 31 2006 agfs allowance for finance receivables losses as a percentage of outstanding

finance operations increased by approximately 17 percent in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 loan growth particularly in poland and argentina was the primary driver behind the higher revenues operating income in the first quarter of 2006 reflects aigcfgs 44 million share of the allowance for losses related to industry wide credit deterioration in the taiwan

consolidated statement of income asset management revenues and operating income increased significantly in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 due primarily to growth in the spread based investment and institutional asset management businesses other revenues and operating income for asset management also increased significantly from a year ago due to higher income from partnerships beginning in the first quarter of 2007 derivative gains and losses and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses which were previously reported as part of aigs other category are

all prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation spread based investment business results operating income related to the spread based investment business increased in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 due to a significant increase in partnership income associated with the domestic gic program partnership income in the first quarter of 2007 included a distribution from a single partnership of 164 million which became available after a five year restriction on capital withdrawals also contributing to the increase in operating income of the spread based investment business were increases in operating income generated by hedge funds and affordable housing partnerships partnership income is primarily derived from alternative investments and is affected by performance in the equity markets thus revenues operating income and cash flows attributable to gics will vary from reporting period to reporting period offsetting this growth in operating income was the continued runoff of gic balances a significant portion of the remaining gic portfolio consists of floating rate obligations aig has entered into hedges to manage against increases in short term interest rates aig believes these hedges are economically effective but they did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 income or loss from these

business are now being reported in the life insurance and retirement services segment all prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation institutional asset management results operating income for institutional asset management increased significantly in the first three months of 2007 compared to the same period of 2006 primarily due to an increase in carried interest and realized capital gains related to hedge funds as well as private equity and real estate partnerships the increase in carried interest was driven by higher 56 american international group inc and subsidiaries valuations of portfolio investments and is generally associated with improved performance in the equity markets operating income also reflects higher gains on certain consolidated investments and partnerships however these gains are offset in minority interest expense which is not a component of operating income on the consolidated statement of income aigs unaffiliated client assets under management including both retail mutual funds and institutional accounts increased 17 percent from march 31 2006 to 76 5 billion at march 31 2007 resulting in higher management fee income the growth in institutional asset management revenues and operating income were driven by contributions from all asset classes globally while unaffiliated client assets under management and the resulting management fees continue to increase the growth in operating income has trailed the growth in revenues due to higher fund related expenses as well as sales and infrastructure enhancements the fund related expenses are associated with aig global asset management holdings corp and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies collectively aiggig purchasing and carrying investments on its

financial derivatives transactions as of such date a downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings to aa3 by moodys or aa by s and p would permit counterparties to call for approximately 902 million of collateral further additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral which could have a material effect on how aigfp manages its liquidity the actual amount of additional collateral that aigfp would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions the fair value of the outstanding affected transactions and
