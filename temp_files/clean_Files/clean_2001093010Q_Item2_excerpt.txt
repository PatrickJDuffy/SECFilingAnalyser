4 percent respectively from those of 2000 during the first nine months of 2001 aig cancelled or non renewed approximately 374 million of business worldwide that did not meet aigs underwriting standards general insurance domestic net premiums written and net premiums earned for the nine month periods ended september 30 2001 and 2000 were as follows in millions data table removed commencing in the latter part of 1999 and continuing through 2001 the commercial property casualty market place has experienced rate increases virtually all areas of dbg have experienced rate increases overall dbgs net premiums written increased 1 80 billion or 28 1 percent in the first nine months of 2001 over 2000 14 personal lines net premiums written decreased 0 5 percent or 10 million in the first nine months of 2001 from 2000 foreign general insurance net premiums written increased 1 3 percent and net premiums earned decreased 1 0 percent in the first nine months of 2001 when compared to the same period of 2000 foreign general insurance operations produced 30 0 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in the first nine months of 2001 and 33 9 percent in 2000 in comparing the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of aigs foreign general operations during the first nine months of 2001 to those foreign currency exchange rates used to translate aigs foreign general results during the same period of 2000 the u s dollar strengthened in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly when foreign net premiums written were translated into u s dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 3 1 percentage points less than they would have been if translated utilizing those foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during that same period of 2000 because of the nature and diversity of aigs operations and the continuing rapid changes in the insurance industry worldwide together with the factors discussed above it is difficult to assess further or project future growth in aigs net premiums written and reserve for losses and loss expenses net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period aig along with most general insurance entities uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance the loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss the statutory general insurance ratios including losses with respect to wtc and related losses were as follows data table removed aig believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company underwriting profit is measured in two ways statutory underwriting profit and generally accepted accounting principles gaap underwriting profit statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting differs from gaap as statutory accounting requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes all expenses most specifically acquisition expenses are recognized immediately not consistent with the revenues earned a basic premise of gaap accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the principle of matching therefore to convert underwriting results to a gaap basis acquisition expenses are deferred and recognized together with the related revenues accordingly the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by gaap thus adjusted underwriting profit is a gaap measurement which can be viewed as gross margin or an intermediate subtotal in calculating operating income and net income 15 a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit exclusive of investment income if underwriting is not profitable losses incurred are a major factor the result is that the premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses and produce a profit therefore investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses if assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods an insurance company cannot survive for these reasons aig views and manages its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations the adjusted underwriting profit loss was 27 million for the first nine months of 2001 and 632 million for the same period of 2000 when wtc and related losses in 2001 are excluded from losses incurred the adjusted underwriting profit would be 742 million for the first nine months of 2001 a 17 4 percent increase over the prior period this increase was primarily due to the domestic adjusted underwriting profit resulting from the disciplined underwriting of dbg the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity regulation product type and competition have a direct impact on pricing and consequently profitability as reflected by adjusted underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios aigs results reflect the impact of incurred losses from catastrophes approximating 817 million which include 769 million with respect to wtc and related losses and 44 million in the first nine months of 2001 and 2000 respectively aigs gross incurred losses from catastrophes approximated 2 1 billion which includes approximately 2 0 billion with respect to the wtc and related losses and 112 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively the impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from period to period making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult the pro forma table below excludes catastrophe losses in order to present comparable results of aigs recurring core underwriting operations the pro forma consolidated statutory general insurance ratios would be as follows data table removed aigs historic ability to maintain its combined ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of aigs foreign general insurance operations and aigs emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting especially in the domestic specialty markets in addition aig does not seek net premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures general insurance net investment income in the first nine months of 2001 increased 7 4 percent when compared to the same period of 2000 the growth in net investment income in 2001 was primarily attributable to new cash flow for investment the new cash flow was generated from net general insurance operating cash flow and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein general insurance realized capital losses were 147 million in the first nine months of 2001 and realized capital gains were 42 million in 2000 these realized capital gains and losses resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities general insurance operating income for the first nine months of 2001 decreased 26 2 percent to 1 97 billion due to the wtc and related losses estimated wtc and related losses recorded in the third quarter of 2001 amounted to 769 million including 200 million from transatlantic holdings inc adjusted general insurance operating income which excludes wtc and related losses as well as realized capital gains losses increased 9 8 percent to 2 89 billion during the first nine months of 2001 the contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes was 36 4 percent during the first nine months of 2001 compared to 36 5 percent in the same period of 2000 aig is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations aig is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs aig insures risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide 16 aig the level of reinsurance protection that aig desires these reinsurance arrangements do not relieve aig from its direct obligations to its insureds aig held general reinsurance assets of 24 81 billion at september 30 2001 as a result of its reinsurance arrangements thus a credit exposure existed at september 30 2001 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse aig under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements aig manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and when necessary aig holds substantial collateral in the form of funds securities and or irrevocable letters of credit this collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis at december 31 2000 approximately 43 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers in order to obtain statutory recognition nearly all of these balances were collateralized the remaining 57 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 95 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated a excellent or better as rated by a m best this rating is a measure of financial strength the terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories not creditworthiness through september 30 2001 these distribution percentages have not significantly changed with respect to the wtc and related losses approximately 1 2 billion of the 2 0 billion in gross losses is covered by reinsurance approximately 99 percent of this coverage was placed with companies that are rated a or better aigs allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance has not significantly changed from december 31 2000 when aig had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating 76 million at that date aig had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled e g liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction aigs reinsurance security department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic such assessments include but are not limited to identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates this department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral in addition aigs credit risk committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer aig enters into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for its general and life operations aig enters these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among various legal entities these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation at september 30 2001 the consolidated general reinsurance assets of 24 81 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of 3 83 billion and 16 17 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses including ceded losses incurred but not reported ibnr ceded reserves the ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments therefrom are reflected in income currently it is aigs belief that the ceded reserves at september 30 2001 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable in the future as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded at september 30 2001 general insurance reserves for losses and loss expenses loss reserves amounted to 41 92 billion these loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including ibnr and loss expenses and amounts of discounting related to certain workers compensation claims at september 30 2001 general insurance net loss reserves increased 803 million from prior year end to 25 75 billion the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently it is managements belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance 17 net losses and loss expenses at september 30 2001 in the future if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations in a very broad sense the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups one group being long tail casualty lines of business such lines include excess and umbrella liability directors and officers liability professional liability medical malpractice general liability products liability and related classes these lines account for approximately one half of net losses and loss expenses the other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines certain classes of casualty lines and includes personal lines estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses net losses for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors including the line and volume of the business involved in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses that is a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid a relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be ibnr a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines these methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next for the majority of long tail casualty lines net loss trend factors approximated four percent loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation thus many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs therefore aigs carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business in the evaluation of aigs net loss reserves loss trend factors vary slightly depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted as appropriate to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines for example if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property the growth in the propertys exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased for other property and short tail casualty lines the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next the concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines aig continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste hazardous substances and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years aig has established a specialized claims unit which investigates and adjusts all such asbestos and environmental claims commencing in 1985 standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage however aig currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process these asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage the current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future additionally the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties 18 and the governments refusal to release parties the cleanup cost exposure may significantly change if potential congressional reauthorization of superfund dramatically changes the current program in the interim aig and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues at the current time it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage as they have in the past as well as by the changes in superfund and waste dump site coverage issues although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims the reserves carried for these claims at september 30 2001 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law furthermore as aigs net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves in the future if the environmental claims develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations see the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein the majority of aigs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages not primary coverages thus the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves that is litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability aig incurs individual significant claim liabilities where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable are established on a case basis a summary of reserve activity including estimates for applicable ibnr relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined at september 30 2001 and 2000 was as follows data table removed the gross and net ibnr included in the aforementioned reserve for losses and loss expenses at september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 were estimated as follows in millions data table removed a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity for the nine month periods ended september 30 2001 and 2000 was as follows data table removed 19 the average cost per claim settled dismissed or otherwise resolved for the nine month periods ended september 30 2001 and 2000 was as follows data table removed a m best an insurance rating agency has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that companys current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments this is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years therefore the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments the higher the ratio the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments these ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments it should be noted however that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio the developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments court orders covered claims with no coverage defenses state mandated cleanup costs claims where aigs coverage defenses are minimal and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting also aig considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary aig believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio the special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages aigs asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites as a result aig reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies aigs survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at september 30 2001 and 2000 were as follows data table removed aigs operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states as a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state aig generally records these assessments upon notice additionally certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities therefore the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated the guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2000 were 15 million based upon current information aig does not anticipate that its net assessment will be significantly different in 2001 aig is also required to participate in various involuntary pools principally workers compensation business which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets this participation is also recorded upon notification as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated life insurance operations aigs life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products traditional products consist of individual and group life annuity endowment and accident

merged into aig in january 1999 the domestic subsidiaries of aig and sunamerica sell primarily financial and investment type products while agcs subsidiaries sell these as well as traditional life products see also note e of notes to financial statements life insurance operations for the nine month periods ending september 30 2001 and 2000 were as follows in millions data table removed amounts presented were as at september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 respectively september 30 2001 included aig star life insurance co ltd formerly the chiyoda mutual life insurance company aigs life premium income during the first nine months of 2001 represented a 11 3 percent increase from the same period in 2000 foreign life operations produced 73 2 percent and 71 7 percent of the life premium income in 2001 and 2000 respectively the traditional life products particularly individual life products were major contributors to the growth in foreign premium income these traditional life products coupled with the increased distribution of financial and investment products contributed to the growth in foreign investment income a mixture of traditional accident and health and financial products are being sold in japan through alico as previously discussed the u s dollar strengthened in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly for the first nine months of 2001 when foreign life premium income was translated into u s dollars for purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total life premium income was approximately 6 8 percentage points less than it would have been if translated utilizing exchange rates prevailing in 2000 life insurance net investment income increased 11 3 percent during the first nine months of 2001 the growth in net investment income was primarily attributable to both foreign and domestic new cash flow for investment the new cash flow was generated from life insurance operations and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein life insurance realized capital gains losses for the first nine months were 4 million in 2001 and 123 million in 2000 these realized capital gains losses resulted from the ongoing management of the life insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity 21 securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities life insurance operating income increased 15 4 percent to 4 12 billion during the first nine months of 2001 when compared to the same period last year estimated wtc and related losses recorded in the third quarter of 2001 amount to 131 million adjusted life operating income which excludes such losses agcs home services operating income which is being managed as a closed block as well as realized capital gains losses increased 15 2 percent to 4 26 billion during the first nine months of 2001 when compared to the same period last year the contribution of life insurance operating income to income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to 76 1 percent during the first nine months of 2001 compared to 48 8 percent in the same period of 2000 the risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk the risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is investment risk underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality morbidity termination and expenses aigs foreign life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately one million dollars of coverage and aigs domestic life companies including those of agc limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to 2 5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance the investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets primarily long term fixed rate investments being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments to minimize its exposure to investment risk aig tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit if a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur a demand could be placed upon liquidity see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs foreign operations as it has been throughout aigs history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities for example in japan and several southeast asia territories the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities at december 31 2000 the average duration of the investment portfolio in japan was 6 0 years additionally there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities the anticipated average period for the receipt and investment of these future premium receipts is 6 1 years these durations compare with an estimated average duration of 10 4 years for the corresponding policy liabilities these durations have not changed significantly during 2001 to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts without sacrificing investment quality to the extent permitted under local regulation aig may invest in qualified longer term securities outside japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield aig is able to manage any asset liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs domestic operations as there is ample supply of qualified long term investments aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in 22 an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes financial services operations aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services

risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques one such technique is value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability aig believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management aig has performed a var analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of aigs insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment in this analysis financial instrument assets include the domestic and 30 foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses reserve for unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders funds due to the nature of each insurance segment aig manages the general and life insurance operations separately as a result aig manages separately the invested assets of each accordingly the var analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aigs insurance segments as of september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 aigs methodology for calculating var and the results of the calculations presented herein were performed using historical simulation using historical simulation over the delta normal approach does not significantly change the results of this disclosure the historical simulation methodology entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period in this case the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios for each scenario each transaction was re priced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the final var number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence i e only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure a one month holding period was assumed in computing the var figure the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 var with respect to combined operations cannot be derived by

ilfc is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates as of september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 aig statistically measured the aforementioned loss of fair value through the application of a var model in this analysis the net fair value of ilfc was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt the estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of ilfc using the historical simulation methodology as previously described as of september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 the var with respect to the aforementioned net fair value of ilfc was approximately 7 million and 11 million respectively aigfps derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available aigfp reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps trading securities options forwards and futures the estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows these transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if aigfp were to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that the impact of any such limited liquidity would not be significant to aigs financial condition or its overall liquidity

of aigfp and aigtg report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with aigs senior management aig actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities in doing so aig must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit market liquidity operational and legal risks market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions aigs philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried credit risk exposure is 33 separately managed see the discussion on the management of credit risk below aigs market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aigs market exposures particularly those market exposures of aigfp and aigtg this department determines whether aigs market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aigs senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and the shape and slope of the yield curve aigfp hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing u s and foreign government obligations aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates aigfp hedges its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps options forwards and futures aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices which affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular stock a basket of stocks or a stock index aigfp reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions including equity swaps and options and purchasing u s and foreign government obligations aigfp does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction rather aigfp takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure aigfp values its portfolio at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of aigfps transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfps and aigs management aigfp evaluates the portfolios discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors based upon this evaluation aigfp determines what if any offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio the aforementioned estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models these models utilize among other things current interest foreign exchange and volatility rates these valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio as described above in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio additionally depending upon the changes in interest rates and other market movements during the day the system will produce reports for managements consideration for intra day offsetting positions overnight the system generates reports which recommend the types of offsets management should consider for the following day additionally aigfp operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day thus the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored reviewed and coordinated around the clock therefore offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any aigfp office in the world as part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk aigfp applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio in addition to the daily monitoring aigfps senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges this review includes an examination of the portfolios risk measures such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables aigfps management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets this management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio all of aigtgs market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes the fair values of aigtgs financial instruments are exposed to market risk as a result of adverse market changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and adverse changes in the liquidity of the markets in which aigtg trades aigtgs approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a 34 particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk aigtg expects to reduce aigtgs senior management has established positions and stop loss limits for each line of business aigtgs traders are required to maintain positions within these limits these positions are monitored during the day either manually and or through on line computer systems in addition these positions are reviewed by aigtgs management reports which present each trading books position and the prior days profit and loss are reviewed by traders head traders and aigtgs senior management based upon these and other reports aigtgs senior management may determine to adjust aigtgs risk profile aigtg attempts to secure reliable current market prices such as published prices or third party quotes to value its derivatives where such prices are not available aigtg uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions the methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates commodity prices volatility rates and other relevant factors a significant portion of aigtgs business is transacted in liquid markets certain of aigtgs derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices interest rates volatility levels and the effect of time aigfp and aigtg are both exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig statistically

var with respect to aigfp and aigtg as of september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 aigs methodology for calculating var and the results of the calculations presented herein were performed using historical simulation using historical simulation over the delta normal approach does not significantly change the results of this disclosure the historical simulation methodology entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period in this case the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios for each scenario each transaction was re priced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the final var number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence i e only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of aigfps and aigtgs market risk as of september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 var with respect to combined operations cannot be derived by aggregating the individual risk presented herein in millions data table removed a a one month holding period was used to measure the market exposures of aigfp b a one day holding period was used to measure the market exposures of aigtg the following table presents the average high and low vars on a combined basis and of each component of aigfps and aigtgs market risk as of september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 35 in millions data table removed derivatives derivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties whose returns are linked to or derived from some underlying equity debt commodity or other asset liability or index derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities certain commodities or financial or commodity indices the more significant types of derivative arrangements in which aig transacts are swaps forwards futures options and related instruments the most commonly used swaps are interest rate swaps currency swaps equity swaps and swaptions such derivatives are traded over the counter an interest rate swap is a contract between two parties to exchange interest rate payments typically a fixed interest rate versus a variable interest rate calculated on a notional principal amount for a specified period of time the notional amount is not exchanged currency and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps but may involve the exchange of principal amounts at the commencement and termination of the swap swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction a futures or forward contract is a legal contract between two parties to purchase or sell at a specified future date a specified quantity of a commodity security currency financial index or other instrument at a specified price a futures contract is traded on an exchange while a forward contract is executed over the counter over the counter derivatives are not transacted in an exchange traded environment the futures exchanges maintain considerable financial requirements and surveillance to ensure the integrity of exchange traded futures and options an option contract generally provides the option purchaser with the right but not the obligation to buy or sell during a period of time or at a specified date the underlying instrument at a set price the option writer is obligated to sell or buy the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise his right the option writer receives a nonrefundable fee or premium paid by the option purchaser options may be traded over the counter or on an exchange derivatives are generally either negotiated over the counter contracts or standardized contracts executed on an exchange standardized exchange traded derivatives include futures and options which can be readily bought or sold over recognized security or commodity exchanges and settled daily through such clearing houses negotiated over the counter derivatives include forwards swaps and options over the counter derivatives are generally not traded like exchange traded securities and the terms of over the counter derivatives are non standard and unique to each contract however in the normal course of business with the agreement of the original counterparty these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty all significant derivatives activities are conducted through aigfp and aigtg permitting aig to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal in these derivative operations aig structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices generally derivatives are used by aigs customers such as corporations financial institutions multinational organizations sovereign entities government agencies and municipalities for example a futures forward or option contract can be used to protect 36 the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations a counterparty may default on any obligation to aig including a derivative contract credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has an estimated positive fair value to help manage this risk the credit departments of aigfp and aigtg operate within the guidelines of the aig credit risk committee which sets credit policy and limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings in addition to credit ratings this committee takes into account other factors including the industry and country of the counterparty transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the aig credit risk committee it is also aigs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary aigfp and aigtg determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations if it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement then one or more enhancement techniques will be used examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit guarantees collateral credit triggers and credit derivatives and margin agreements a significant majority of aigfps transactions are contracted and documented under isda master agreements management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set off in the event of default also under such agreements in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity aigfp may be permitted to set off its receivables from that counterparty against aigfps payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions excluding regulated exchange transactions aigtg whenever possible enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above the following tables provide the notional and contractual amounts of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives transactions at september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 the notional amounts used to express the extent of aigfps and aigtgs involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of aigfps and aigtgs swaps business notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received except for certain contracts such as currency swaps the timing and the amount of cash flows relating to aigfps and aigtgs foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements the net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to aigfp or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies netting under isda master agreements and applying collateral held prior to the application of these credit enhancements the gross credit risk with respect to these derivative instruments was 58 5 billion at september 30 2001 and 33 4 billion at december 31 2000 subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate currency and equity swaps swaptions and forward commitments approximated 12 30 billion at september 30 2001 and 9 51 billion at december 31 2000 the net replacement value for futures and forward contracts approximated 44 million at september 30 2001 and 204 million at december 31 2000 the net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to aigfp or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss 37 the following table presents aigfps derivatives portfolio by maturity and type of derivative at september 30 2001 and december 31 2000 in millions data

removed exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis generally aig manages and operates its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment thus exchange gains or losses occur when aigs foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the u s dollar from one reporting period to the next aig through its foreign exchange operating committee evaluates each of its worldwide consolidated foreign currency net asset or liability positions and manages aigs translation exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rates aig may use forward exchange contracts and purchase options where the cost of such is reasonable and 40 markets are liquid to reduce these exchange translation exposures the exchange gain or loss with respect to these hedging instruments is recorded on an accrual basis as a component of comprehensive income in capital funds as an end user aig and its subsidiaries including its insurance subsidiaries use derivatives to aid in managing aigs foreign exchange translation exposure derivatives may also be used to minimize certain exposures with respect to aigs debt financing and its insurance operations to date such activities have not been significant aig has formed a derivatives review committee this committee with certain exceptions provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction the committee examines among other things the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction its potential credit exposure if any and the estimated benefits this committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by aigfp and aigtg for their own accounts legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability through legal or judicial processes of the obligations of aigs clients and counterparties including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations see also the discussion on master netting agreements above aig seeks to eliminate or minimize such uncertainty through continuous consultation with internal and external legal advisors both domestically and abroad in order to understand the nature of legal risk to improve documentation and to strengthen transaction structure accounting standards in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in june 2000 fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 138 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133 collectively fasb 133 fasb 133 requires aig to recognize all derivatives in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value the financial statement recognition of the change in the fair value of a derivative depends on a number of factors including the intended use of the derivative and the extent to which the derivative is effective as part of a hedge transaction the changes in fair value of the derivative transactions of aigfp and aigtg are currently presented in all material respects as a component of aigs operating income the discussion below relates to the derivative activities of aig other than those of aigfp and aigtg on the date the derivative contract is entered into aig designates the derivative as 1 a hedge of the subsequent changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge 2 a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge or 3 a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation fair value and cash flow hedges may involve foreign currencies foreign currency hedges the gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated qualifies and is highly effective as a fair value hedge is recorded in current period earnings along with the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk the gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated qualifies and is highly effective as a cash flow hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows the gain or loss in the fair value of a derivative that is designated qualifies and is highly effective as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments account within other comprehensive income changes in the fair value of derivatives used for other than the above hedging activities are reported in current period earnings aig documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions aig also assesses both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items in accordance with the transition provisions of fasb 133 aig recorded in its consolidated in 41 come statement for the first nine months of 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment loss of 6 million this amount is presented as a component of other income deductions net this loss represents the net fair value of all previously unrecorded derivative instruments as of january 1 2001 net of tax and after the application of hedge accounting aig also recorded in its consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the first nine months of 2001 a cumulative effect of an accounting change adjustment gain of 150 million this gain represents the increase in other comprehensive income net of taxes arising from recognizing the fair value of all derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments and to a lesser extent hedging instruments used to hedge net investments in foreign operations in january 2001 the emerging

commencing january 1 2002 recent developments on november 9 2001 aig issued zero coupon convertible senior debentures due 2031 in an aggregate principal amount at maturity of approximately 1 52 billion excluding an over allotment option of approximately 228 million principal amount at maturity the convertible debentures are convertible into shares of aig common stock under certain specified conditions the convertible debentures are not callable for five years after issuance and mature in 30 years however holders can require aig to repurchase the convertible debentures once every five years the convertible debentures were offered through morgan stanley and co incorporated with original issue discount and generated gross proceeds of approximately 1 0 billion aig will use the proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes the zero coupon convertible senior debentures were offered at an initial offering price of 658 01 per 1 000 of principal amount at maturity the issue price represents a yield to maturity of 1 4 percent per annum with a conversion rate of 6 0627 shares of common stock per 1 000 principal amount at maturity of convertible debentures 42 part ii
