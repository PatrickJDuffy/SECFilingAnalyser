managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is designed to provide the reader with a narrative with respect to aigs operations financial condition and liquidity and certain other significant matters index data table removed operational review consolidated results aigs net income in the first six months of 2002 increased 19 3 percent to 3 78 billion when compared to 3 17 billion in the same period of 2001 excluding 425 million of acquisition restructuring and related charges net of tax incurred in 2001 aigs net income in the first six months of 2002 increased 5 2 percent aigs operations are conducted principally through four business segments general

insurance operating income increased 12 1 percent reflecting strong growth in adjusted underwriting profit the growth in investment income slowed primarily as a result of lower earnings from the private equity portfolio life insurance life insurance operating income increased 5 1 percent in the first six months of 2002 compared to the same period in 2001 excluding realized capital gains losses life insurance operating income increased 18 1 percent reflecting operating income growth in each of aigs principal life insurance businesses financial services financial services operating

management retirement savings and asset management operating income increased 4 9 percent in the first six months of 2002 when compared to the same period in 2001 this growth was principally a result of the operations of the variable annuity life insurance company valic realized capital losses during the first six months of 2002 aig incurred net realized capital losses of 861 million including 356 million from worldcom securities capital resources at june 30 2002 aig had total capital funds of 54 96 billion and total borrowings of 68 87 billion at that date 58 59 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by aig or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements gias or matched notes and bonds payable during the period from january 1 2002 through august 5 2002 aig repurchased in the open market 10 148 000 shares of its common stock liquidity at june 30 2002 consolidated invested assets were 393 4 billion including 13 21 billion in cash and short term investments consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in the first six months of 2002 amounted to 6 45 billion outlook for the remainder of 2002 premium rates in the general insurance business are continuing to strengthen both domestically and in key international markets along with policy restrictions and exclusions in the life insurance segment the integration of agc and its operations is proceeding well general insurance operations aigs general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance domestic general insurance operations are comprised of the domestic brokerage group dbg which includes the hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company hsb transatlantic holdings inc transatlantic personal lines including 21st century insurance group 21st century and mortgage guaranty dbg is aigs primary domestic general division dbg writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers this provides dbg the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control any licensed broker is able to submit business to dbg without the traditional agent company contractual relationship but such broker usually has no authority to commit dbg to accept a risk transatlantic offers reinsurance capacity both

operations for the six month periods ending june 30 2002 and 2001 were as follows in millions data table removed reflects the realignment of certain internal divisions in each year general insurance results during the first six months of 2002 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 32 2 percent and 20 1 percent respectively from those of 2001 during the first six months of 2002 aig cancelled or non renewed approximately 372 million of business worldwide that did not meet aigs underwriting standards commencing in the latter part of 1999 and continuing through 2002 the commercial property casualty market place has experienced rate increases virtually all areas of dbg have experienced rate increases overall dbgs net premiums written increased 2 14 billion or 43 0 percent in the first six months of 2002 over 2001 personal lines net premiums written increased 23 0 percent or 287 million in the first six months of 2002 from 2001 reflecting auto insurance rate increases in many states foreign general insurance net premiums written increased 20 0 percent and net premiums earned increased 6 4 percent in the first six months of 2002 when compared to the same period of 2001 foreign general insurance operations produced 23 2 percent of the general insurance net premiums written in the first six months of 2002 and 25 6 percent in 2001 in comparing the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of aigs foreign general operations during the first six months of 2002 to those average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate aigs foreign general results during the same period of 2001 the u s dollar strengthened in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly when foreign net premiums written were translated into u s dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 2 2 percentage points less than they would have been if translated utilizing those average foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during that same period of 2001 net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as 26 net premiums earned until the end of the policy period aig along with most general insurance entities uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance the loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss the statutory general insurance ratios for the six months ending june 30 2002 and 2001 were as follows data table removed the adjusted underwriting profit was 726 million for the first six months of 2002 and 496 million for the same period of 2001 this increase resulted from premium rate increases and disciplined underwriting aig believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company underwriting profit is measured in two ways statutory underwriting profit and generally accepted accounting principles gaap underwriting profit statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting differs from gaap as statutory accounting requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes all expenses most specifically acquisition expenses are recognized immediately not over the same period that the revenues are earned a basic premise of gaap accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the principle of matching therefore to convert underwriting results to a gaap basis acquisition expenses are deferred and recognized together with the related revenues accordingly the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by gaap thus adjusted underwriting profit is a gaap measurement which can be viewed as gross margin or an intermediate subtotal in calculating operating income and net income a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit exclusive of investment income if underwriting is not profitable losses incurred are a major factor the result is that the premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses and produce a profit therefore investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses if assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods an insurance company cannot survive for these reasons aig views and manages its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations see also the discussion under liquidity herein the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity regulation product type and competition have a direct impact on pricing and consequently profitability as reflected by adjusted underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios aig did not incur any catastrophe losses in the first six months of 2002 aig incurred net losses from catastrophes approximating 48 million in the first six months of 2001 aigs gross incurred losses from catastrophes approximated 101 million in the first six months of 2001 while aig believes that it has taken appropriate steps to reduce the magnitude of possible future losses the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity such as a terrorist attack earthquake or hurricane that causes insured losses could have a material adverse effect on aigs results of operations liquidity or financial condition current tech 27 niques and models may not accurately predict in the future the probability of catastrophic events and the extent of the resulting losses moreover one or more catastrophe losses could impact negatively aigs reinsurers and result in an inability of aig to collect reinsurance recoverables the impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from period to period making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult the pro forma table below excludes catastrophe losses in order to present comparable results of aigs recurring core underwriting operations the pro forma consolidated statutory general insurance ratios for the six months ending june 30 2002 and 2001 would be as follows data table removed aigs historic ability to maintain its combined ratio below 100 is primarily attributable to the profitability of aigs foreign general insurance operations and aigs emphasis on maintaining its disciplined underwriting especially in the domestic specialty markets in addition aig does not seek net premium growth where rates do not adequately reflect its assessment of exposures general insurance net investment income in the first six months of 2002 increased 0 2 percent when compared to the same period of 2001 the growth in net investment income in 2002 has slowed significantly primarily as a result of lower earnings from the general insurance private equity portfolio also interest income earned from the general insurance bond portfolio was impacted by lower yields as the proceeds from maturing fixed income securities are reinvested however the cash flow resulting from the growth in net premiums written should have positive impact on net investment income in future quarters see also the discussion under liquidity herein general insurance realized capital losses were 282 million and 58 million in the first six months of 2002 and 2001 respectively these realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities as well as redemptions of fixed maturities general insurance operating income for the first six months of 2002 increased 0 5 percent to 1 87 billion the contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes was 32 6 percent during the first six months of 2002 compared to 38 7 percent in the same period of 2001 reinsurance aig is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations aig is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs aig insures general risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide aig the level of reinsurance protection that aig desires these reinsurance arrangements do not relieve aig from its direct obligations to its insureds aig held general reinsurance assets of 28 87 billion at june 30 2002 as a result of its reinsurance arrangements thus a credit exposure existed at june 30 2002 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse aig under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements aig manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and when necessary aig holds substantial collateral in the form of funds securities and or irrevocable letters of credit this collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis at december 31 2001 approximately 43 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers in order to obtain statutory recognition nearly all of these balances were collateralized the remaining 57 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 97 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated a excellent or better as rated by a m best this rating is a measure of financial strength the terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories not creditworthiness through june 30 2002 these distribution percentages have not changed significantly aigs allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance has not changed significantly from december 31 2001 when aig had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating 75 million at june 30 2002 aig had no significant 28 reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled e g liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction aigs reinsurance security department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic such assessments include but are not limited to identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates this department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral in addition aigs credit risk committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer aig enters into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for its general and life operations aig enters these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among various legal entities these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation at june 30 2002 the consolidated general reinsurance assets of 28 87 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of 4 04 billion and 19 26 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses including ceded losses incurred but not reported ibnr ceded reserves the ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments therefrom are reflected in income currently it is aigs belief that the ceded reserves at june 30 2002 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable in the future as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded reserves for losses and loss expenses at june 30 2002 general insurance reserves for losses and loss expenses loss reserves amounted to 45 66 billion these loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including ibnr and loss expenses and amounts of discounting related to certain workers compensation claims at june 30 2002 general insurance net loss reserves increased 505 million from prior year end to 26 40 billion the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently it is managements belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses at june 30 2002 in the future if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently as a result of a variety of factors which are increasingly difficult to quantify such as the litigious nature of our society the increasing size of jury awards and settlements and the failure to make progress in tort reform such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations in a very broad sense the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups one group being long tail casualty lines of business such lines include excess and umbrella liability directors and officers liability professional liability medical malpractice general liability products liability and related classes these lines account for approximately one half of net losses and loss expenses the other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses net losses for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors including the line and volume of the business involved in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses that is a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid a relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be ibnr a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines these methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next for the majority of long tail casualty lines net loss trend factors 29 approximated four percent loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling exposure and policy forms and current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation thus many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs therefore aigs carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business in the evaluation of aigs net loss reserves loss trend factors vary slightly depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted as appropriate to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines for example if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property the growth in the propertys exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased for other property and short tail casualty lines the loss trend is implicitly assumed to grow at the rate that reported net losses grow from one year to the next the concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines environmental claims aig continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste hazardous substances and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites hereinafter referred to collectively as environmental claims and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years aig continues to maintain specialized toxic tort and environmental claim units established over a decade ago which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims highly rated with respect to claim file handling and case reserving by independent sources these units utilize a comprehensive ground up bottom up approach to claim adjusting by thoroughly evaluating each exposure on a claim by claim basis commencing in 1985 standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage however aig currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process these asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage the current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future additionally the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties in the interim aig and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues at the current time it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage as they have in the past as well as by the changes in superfund and waste dump site coverage issues although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims the reserves carried for these claims at june 30 2002 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law furthermore as aigs net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves in the future if the environmental claims develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations see the 30 previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein the majority of aigs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages not primary coverages thus the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves that is litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability aig incurs individual significant claim liabilities where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable are established on a case basis a summary of reserves and activity for the six months then ended june 30 2002 and 2001 including estimates for applicable ibnr relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately is as follows data table removed the average cost per claim settled dismissed or otherwise resolved for the six month periods ended june 30 2002 and 2001 was as follows data table removed the gross and net ibnr included in the aforementioned reserve for losses and loss expenses at june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 were estimated as follows in millions data table removed a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity for the six month periods ended june 30 2002 and 2001 was as follows data table removed a m best an insurance rating agency has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and 31 loss expenses based on that companys current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments this is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years therefore the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments the higher the ratio the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments these ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments it should be noted however that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio the developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments court orders covered claims with no coverage defenses state mandated cleanup costs claims where aigs coverage defenses are minimal and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting also aig considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary aig believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio the special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages aigs asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites as a result aig reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies aigs survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at june 30 2002 and 2001 were as follows data table removed aigs operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states as a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state aig generally records these assessments upon notice additionally certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities therefore the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated the guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2001 were 24 million based upon current information aig does not anticipate that its net assessment will be significantly different in 2002 aig is also required to participate in various involuntary pools principally workers compensation business which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets this participation is also recorded upon notification as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated life insurance operations aigs life insurance subsidiaries offer a wide range of traditional insurance and financial and investment products traditional products consist of individual and group life annuity endowment and accident and health policies financial and investment products consist of single premium annuity variable annuities guaranteed investment contracts universal life and pensions aigs three principal overseas life operations are american life insurance company alico american international assurance company limited together with american international assurance company bermuda limited aia and nan shan life insurance company ltd nan shan alico is incorporated in delaware and all of its business is written outside of the united 32 states alico has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in approximately 50 countries located in europe africa latin america the caribbean the middle east and the far east with japan being the largest territory in 2001 aig added significantly to its presence in japan with the acquisition of aig star life insurance co ltd aig star life as a result of the reorganization of chiyoda mutual life insurance company aia operates primarily in hong kong singapore malaysia and thailand nan shan operates in taiwan aigs principal domestic life insurance subsidiaries include american general life aig annuity and sunamerica life these companies utilize multiple distribution channels including brokerage and career and general agents to offer traditional life products as well as financial investment products see also note e of notes to financial statements life insurance premium income presented in accordance with gaap for the six month periods ending june 30 2002 and 2001 was as follows in millions data table removed life insurance operations presented on a major product basis for the six month periods ending june 30 2002 and 2001 were as follows in millions data table removed amounts presented were as at june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 life insurance results life insurance operating income increased 5 1 percent to 2 54 billion during the first six months of 2002 when compared to the same period last year the contribution of life insurance operating income to income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting changes amounted to 44 4 percent during the first six months of 2002 compared to 50 4 percent in the same period of 2001 aigs gaap life premium income during the first six months of 2002 represented a 8 5 percent increase from the same period in 2001 foreign life operations produced 77 3 percent and 71 8 percent 33 of the gaap life premium income in 2002 and 2001 respectively the traditional life products particularly individual life products were major contributors to the growth in foreign premium income these traditional life products coupled with the increased distribution of financial and investment products contributed to the growth in foreign investment income a mixture of traditional accident and health and financial products are being sold in japan through alico and aig star life since aig purchased aig star life a part of income earned by aig star life has resulted from surrender charges earned on policies that were either surrendered or lapsed this favorable impact on operating income was anticipated when aig took control as these surrenders diminish in subsequent periods operating income from that source will also be impacted the majority of aig star lifes future income is expected to be related to continuing premiums paid on renewal business and new business to be generated from a growing agency force as previously discussed the u s dollar strengthened in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly for the first six months of 2002 when foreign life premium income was translated into u s dollars for purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total life premium income was approximately 4 0 percentage points less than it would have been if translated utilizing average exchange rates prevailing in 2001 life insurance net investment income increased 9 6 percent during the first six months of 2002 the growth in net investment income was primarily attributable to both foreign and domestic new cash flow for investment the new cash flow was generated from life insurance operations and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein life insurance realized capital losses for the first six months were 339 million in 2002 and 21 million in 2001 these realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing management of the life insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and arose primarily from the disposition of equity securities and available for sale fixed maturities redemptions of fixed maturities and incurred losses from worldcom securities underwriting and investment risk the risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk the risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is investment risk underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality morbidity termination and expenses aigs foreign life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately one million dollars of coverage and aigs domestic life companies including those of agc limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to 2 5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance the investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets primarily long term fixed rate investments being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments to minimize its exposure to investment risk aig tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit if a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur a demand could be placed upon liquidity see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs foreign operations as it has been throughout aigs history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities for example in japan and several southeast asia territories the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities at 34 december 31 2001 the average duration of the investment portfolio with respect to alico japans operations was 5 4 years additionally there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities the anticipated average period for the receipt and investment of these future premium receipts with respect to alico japans operations is 6 4 years these durations compare with an estimated average duration with respect to alico japans operations of 10 5 years for the corresponding policy liabilities these durations have not changed significantly during 2002 to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts without sacrificing investment quality to the extent permitted under local regulation aig may invest in qualified longer term securities outside japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield aig is able to manage any asset liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs domestic operations as there is ample supply of qualified long term investments aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes

the funds managing market risk aigs insurance operations are exposed to market risk market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques one such technique is value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability 45 aig believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management aig has performed a var analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of aigs insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment in this analysis financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses reserve for unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders funds due to the nature of each insurance segment aig manages the general and life insurance operations separately as a result aig manages separately the invested assets of each accordingly the var analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aigs insurance segments as of june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 aig uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period in this case the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios for each scenario each transaction was re priced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the final var number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence i e only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure a one month holding period was assumed in computing the var figure the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 var

value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates as of june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 aig statistically measured the aforementioned loss of fair value through the application of a var model in this analysis the net fair value of ilfc was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt the estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of ilfc using the historical simulation methodology as previously described as of june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 the var with respect to the aforementioned net fair value of

aigfp takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell aigfp further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and when aigfp deems necessary it requires additional collateral to be deposited trading securities at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of aigfp aigfp is exposed to credit risk if its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement aigfp could have a liquidity strain aig guarantees aigfps debt and as a result is responsible for all of aigfps obligations aigtg conducts as principal market making and trading activities in foreign exchange and commodities primarily precious and base metals aigtg owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps forwards futures and option contracts aigtg uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices aigtg supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities unrealized losses on swaps short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased see also the discussions under capital resources and derivatives herein 48 the gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of aigfp and aigtg included in the financial services assets and liabilities at june 30 2002 were as follows in millions data table removed a these amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts b at june 30 2002 aigtgs replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps were 334 million aigfps interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale at market are managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation at june 30 2002 the unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were 63 million and 58 million respectively trading securities at market value and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time these securities and positions are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of aigfp and aigtg the senior management of aig defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for aigfp and aigtg aigs senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market operational and credit issues of aigfp and aigtg the senior managements of aigfp and aigtg report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with aigs senior management aig actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities in doing so aig must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit market liquidity operational and legal risks managing market risk market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions aigs philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried credit risk exposure is separately managed see the discussion on the management of credit risk below aigs market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aigs market exposures particularly those market exposures of aigfp and aigtg this department determines whether aigs market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aigs senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and the shape and slope of the yield curve aigfp hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing u s and foreign government obligations aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates aigfp hedges its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps options forwards and futures aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices which affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular stock a basket of stocks or a stock index aigfp reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions including equity swaps and options and purchasing u s and foreign government obligations 49 aigfp does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction rather aigfp takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure aigfp values its portfolio including interest rate swaps currency swaps equity swaps swaptions options and forwards at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available unrealized gains and losses with respect to this portfolio are reflected in income currently these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of aigfps transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfps and aigs management aigfp evaluates the portfolios discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors the aforementioned estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models these models utilize among other things market liquidity and current interest foreign exchange and volatility rates aigfp attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices such as published exchange prices external subscription services such as from bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available aigfp uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions historically actual results have not materially deviated from these models these valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio as described above in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio based upon this evaluation aigfp determines what if any offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio aig manages its market risk with a variety of transactions including swaps trading securities futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate the recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if aigfp were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations financial condition or liquidity such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity additionally depending upon the changes in interest rates and other market movements during the day the system will produce reports for managements consideration for intra day offsetting positions overnight the system generates reports which recommend the types of offsets management should consider for the following day additionally aigfp operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day thus the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored reviewed and coordinated around the clock therefore offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any aigfp office in the world as part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk aigfp applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio in addition to the daily monitoring aigfps senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges this review includes an examination of the portfolios risk measures such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables aigfps management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets this management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio all of aigtgs market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes the fair values of aigtgs financial instruments are exposed to market risk as a result of adverse market changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and adverse changes in the liquidity of the markets in which aigtg trades aigtgs approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk aigtg expects to reduce aigtgs senior management has established positions and stop loss limits for each line of business aigtgs traders are required to maintain positions within these limits these positions are monitored during the day either manually and or through on line computer systems in addition these positions are reviewed by aigtgs management reports which present each trading books position and the prior days profit and loss are reviewed by traders head traders and aigtgs 50 senior management based upon these and other reports aigtgs senior management may determine to adjust aigtgs risk profile aigtg attempts to secure reliable current market prices such as published prices or third party quotes to value its derivatives where such prices are not available aigtg uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions historically actual results have not materially deviated from these models the methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates commodity prices volatility rates and other relevant factors unrealized gains and losses with respect to aigtgs positions are reflected in income currently a significant portion of aigtgs business is transacted in liquid markets certain of aigtgs derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices interest rates volatility levels market liquidity and the effect of time aigfp and aigtg are both exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a var model aig separately calculated the var with respect to aigfp and aigtg as aig manages these operations separately aigfps and aigtgs asset and liability portfolios for which the var analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments derivative instruments and commodities because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale at market is substantially hedged segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary aig calculated the var with respect to aigfp and aigtg as of june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 aig uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period in this case the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios for each scenario each transaction was re priced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the final var number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence i e only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of aigfps and aigtgs market risk as of june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 var with respect to combined operations cannot be derived by aggregating the individual risk presented herein in millions data table removed a a one month holding period was used to measure the market exposures of aigfp b a one day holding period was used to measure the market exposures of aigtg 51 the following table presents the average high and low vars on a combined basis and of each component of aigfps and aigtgs market risk as of june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 in millions data table removed derivatives derivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties the returns of the derivatives are linked to or derived from some underlying equity debt commodity or other asset liability or index derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities certain commodities or financial or commodity indices the more significant types of derivative arrangements in which aig transacts are swaps forwards futures and options in the normal course of business with the agreement of the original counterparty these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty the overwhelming majority of aigs derivatives activities are conducted through aigfp and aigtg thus permitting aig to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal in these derivative operations aig structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices aigs customers such as corporations financial institutions multinational organizations sovereign entities government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures for example a futures forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations a counterparty may default on any obligation to aig including a derivative contract credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to aig to help manage this risk the credit departments of aigfp and aigtg operate within the guidelines set by the aig credit risk committee this committee establishes the credit policy sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings in addition to credit ratings this committee takes into account other factors including the industry and country of the counterparty transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the aig credit risk committee it is also aigs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary aigfp and aigtg determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statistical rating organizations if it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement then one or more enhancement techniques will be used examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit guarantees collateral credit triggers and credit derivatives and margin agreements a significant majority of aigfps transactions are contracted and documented under isda master agreements management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set off in the event of default also under such agreements in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity aigfp may be permitted to set off its receivables from that counterparty against aigfps payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions excluding regulated exchange transactions aigtg whenever possible enters into netting agreements with its counterparties which are similar in effect to those discussed above 52 discussions with respect to aigfps and aigtgs counterpart credit quality fair value source and notional amounts follow counterparty credit quality the following tables provide the counterparty credit quality amounts of aigfps and aigtgs derivatives transactions at june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 the net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to aigfp or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss after the application of the aforementioned strategies netting under isda master agreements and applying collateral held subsequent to the application of such credit enhancements the net exposure to credit risk or the net replacement value of all interest rate currency and equity swaps swaptions and forward commitments approximated 11 28 billion at june 30 2002 and 10 84 billion at december 31 2001 the net replacement value for futures and forward contracts approximated 51 million at june 30 2002 and 64 million at december 31 2001 the net replacement value most closely represents the net credit risk to aigfp or the maximum amount exposed to potential loss and is used for financial reporting purposes aigfp determines counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or where such ratings are not available by internal analysis at june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 the concentration of credit exposure with respect to counterparties judged a or higher by aigfp was 93 percent and 93 percent respectively the counterparty credit quality determined by aigfp by derivative product with respect to the net

deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis 54 fair value source the fair value sources of the net replacement values of aigfps derivatives portfolio were based on valuation models although these models are proprietary the inputs were obtained from independently published exchange prices external subscription services prices such as bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in these models when such prices are not available aigfp uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions at june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 the fair value source of the net replacement value of aigtgs derivatives portfolio was as follows in millions data table removed notional amounts the notional amounts used to express the extent of aigfps and aigtgs involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of aigfps and aigtgs swaps business notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received except for certain contracts such as currency swaps the timing and the amount of cash flows relating to aigfps and aigtgs foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements the following table presents aigfps derivative portfolio by maturity and type of derivatives at june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 in millions data table removed notional amount is not representative of either market risk or credit risk 55 the following table provides the contractual and notional amounts by maturity and type of derivative of aigtgs derivatives portfolio at june 30 2002 and december 31 2001 in millions data table removed a sold options obligate aigtg to buy or sell the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise the amounts do not represent credit exposure b notional amount is not representative of either market risk or credit risk in addition to its role as derivatives dealer through aigfp and aigtg aig and its subsidiaries including its insurance subsidiaries use derivatives primarily to minimize aigs asset liability exposure and foreign currency and interest rate exposures these transactions are generally executed with aigfp and aigtg as counterparty who in turn hedge these transactions in the market place thus aigfp and aigtg assume the credit risk exposure aig also uses derivatives to help match assets and liabilities in several of its businesses including its insurance operations for example aig can use currency and interest rate swaps to convert foreign currency investment contract liabilities into us dollar based exposures thus these liabilities are more properly matched with us dollar assets in life insurance aig uses swaps to reduce the mismatch between long dated life insurance liabilities and shorter dated local currency assets swaps also enable aig to balance its asset and liability durations in consumer finance operations aigs derivatives review committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction the committee examines among other things the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction its potential credit exposure if any and the estimated benefits this committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by aigfp and aigtg for their own accounts generally aig conducts its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment thus exchange gains or losses occur when aigs foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the u s dollar from one reporting period to the next legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability through legal or judicial processes of the obligations of aigs clients and counterparties including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations see also the discussion on master netting agreements above important accounting policies aig considers among its most important accounting policies those policies with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts deferred policy acquisition costs and fair value with respect to certain assets and liabilities of certain of the subsidiaries of aigs financial services operations these are the policies that require managements most significant exercise of judgment on both a quantitative and qualitative basis further explanation of how management exercises that judgment is included throughout this managements discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2001 56 accounting standards in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets fasb 142 as of january 1 2002 aig adopted fasb 142 fasb 142 requires aig to discontinue the amortization of goodwill in its consolidated income statement amortization expense recorded in aigs consolidated statement of income amounted to 76 million pre tax for the first six months of 2001 and 40 million pre tax for the second quarter of 2001 fasb 142 requires goodwill to be subject to an assessment of impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred the assessment of impairment involves a two step process prescribed in fasb 142 whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed followed by a measurement of the amount of impairment if any fasb 142 also requires the completion of a transitional impairment test in the year of adoption with any identified impairments recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles during the second quarter aig completed its transitional impairment test for 2002 resulting in no impairment changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are primarily caused as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments 57 part ii
