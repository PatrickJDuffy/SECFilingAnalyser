managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is designed to provide the reader a narrative with respect to aigs operations financial condition and liquidity and certain other significant matters index data table removed executive summary aigs operations are conducted principally through four business segments general insurance life insurance financial services and retirement savings and asset management within each of these business segments are various operating groups generally formed based upon products or services which may be offered in different geographic locations throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aig presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful as well as most transparent operating income is shown exclusive of realized capital gains losses because the determination to realize capital gains or losses is generally independent of the insurance underwriting process moreover the equity analysts who follow aig exclude such realized transactions in their analyses for 29 the same reason premium income gross premiums written statutory underwriting profit loss and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with aigs insurance competitors a reconciliation of these measurements to the most equivalent measurements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap is presented on page 28 consolidated results aigs revenues in the first three months of 2003 increased 17 3 percent to 18 9 billion when compared to 16 1 billion in the same period of 2002 growth in revenues was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from the global insurance operations this growth was negatively impacted by realized capital losses incurred the following tables reconcile results reported on a gaap basis to the presentation aig management believes is most meaningful income before income taxes and minority interest in millions data table removed net income in millions data table removed aigs income before income taxes and minority interest decreased 1 2 percent in the first three months of 2003 when compared to the same period of 2002 the factor causing the decrease was the increase in realized capital losses if the realized capital losses were excluded from the first three months of 2003 and the same period of 2002 growth in aigs income before taxes and minority interest would be 11 4 percent aigs net income in the first three months of 2003 decreased 1 4 percent to 1 95 billion when compared to 1 98 billion in the same period of 2002 excluding realized capital gains losses net of taxes aigs net income in the first three months of 2003 increased 11 1 percent the following table summarizes the operations of each principal segment for the first three months of 2003 and 2002 in millions data

operations retirement savings and asset management retirement savings and asset management operating income decreased 5 6 percent in the first three months of 2003 when compared to the same period in 2002 results in the individual variable annuity and mutual fund businesses continue to be impacted by weak equity markets in the united states and around the world realized capital losses during the first three months of 2003 aig incurred net realized capital losses of 632 million these realized capital losses reflect continued weakness in the equity markets and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings capital resources at march 31 2003 aig had total capital funds of 62 26 billion and total borrowings of 74 37 billion at that date 65 63 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by aig or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements gias or matched notes and bonds payable during the period from january 1 2003 through march 31 2003 aig repurchased in the open market 1 625 000 shares of its common stock liquidity at march 31 2003 consolidated invested assets were 459 94 billion including 14 92 billion in cash and short term investments consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in the first three months of 2003 amounted to 8 89 billion outlook premium rates in the general insurance business are continuing to strengthen both domestically and in key international markets along with policy restrictions and exclusions aig expects that such rate increases will continue through 2003 such increases will have a strong positive impact on cash flow available for investment thus general insurances net investment income is expected to rise in future quarters even in the low interest rate environment in the life insurance segment aig expects continued growth with respect to its domestic individual fixed annuity operation while in overseas markets aigs life insurance operations are expected to continue double digit growth aig continues to expand its operations in china becoming the first foreign insurance organization to have wholly owned life insurance operations in beijing suzhou dongguan and jiangmen as well as previously established operations in shanghai foshan guangzhou and shenzhen aig also expects india and vietnam to offer additional opportunities for growth aig expects that ilfc will continue its growth and operating profitability even as the airline industry remains under stress ilfc derives over 80 percent of its lease revenues from foreign carriers thus limiting its exposure to the domestic commercial aviation market which is significantly more depressed than the rest of the industry aig is also optimistic about opportunities for growth in its consumer finance business through continued expansion of overseas credit card operations and alternative distribution systems such as the use of the internet during 2003 aig also expects to expand its recently formed international retirement savings operations the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars did not impact aigs operations during the first quarter of 2003 however sars may impede agents from freely visiting prospects and will have some impact on new sales in certain asian markets during the second quarter of 2003 as a result aig has increased its direct marketing efforts including telephone marketing there is growing demand for some of aigs traditional policyholder protection and critical illness products aig expects sars to have only a slight impact on operating income critical accounting estimates aig considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts deferred policy acquisition costs and fair value determinations with respect to certain assets and liabilities of certain of the subsidiaries of aigs financial services operations these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation reserves for losses and loss expenses are estimated using data where the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines have limited statistical credibility in reported net losses see also the discussions reserve for losses and loss expenses and asbestos and 31 environmental claims herein the liability for future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts include estimates for interest rates mortality and surrender rates and invested asset performance see also the discussion life insurance operations recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs are contingent upon the underlying insurance operations being profitable see

data table removed general insurance results during the first three months of 2003 net premiums written and net premiums earned increased 30 1 percent and 32 3 percent respectively from those of 2002 commencing in the latter part of 1999 and continuing through and into the current quarter the commercial property casualty market place has experienced rate increases virtually all areas of dbg have experienced rate increases as well as maintaining an excellent retention rate for desired renewal business the vast majority of the increase in the first three months of 2003 resulted from rate increases with respect to renewed business overall dbgs net premiums written increased 1 09 billion or 31 7 percent in the first three months of 2003 over 2002 adjusting this growth for cancelled or non renewed business such growth would have approximated 37 percent personal lines net premiums written increased 21 8 percent or 158 million in the first three months of 2003 from 2002 reflecting auto insurance rate increases in many states foreign general insurance net premiums written increased 30 7 percent and net premiums earned increased 38 6 percent in the first three months of 2003 when compared to the same period of 2002 in comparing the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of aigs foreign general operations during the first three months of 2003 to those average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate aigs foreign general results during the same period of 2002 the u s dollar weakened slightly in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly when foreign net premiums written were translated into u s dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 1 7 percentage points more than they would have been if translated utilizing those average foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during that same period of 2002 net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period aig along with most general insurance entities uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance the loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss the statutory general insurance ratios for the three months ending march 31 2003 and 2002 were as follows data table removed aig believes that underwriting profit is the true measure of the performance of the core business of a general insurance company 33 underwriting profit is measured in two ways statutory underwriting profit and generally accepted accounting principles gaap underwriting profit statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting differs from gaap as statutory accounting in general requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes expenses are recognized immediately not over the same period that the revenues are earned a basic premise of gaap accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the principle of matching therefore to convert underwriting results to a gaap basis acquisition expenses are deferred deferred acquisition costs dac and amortized over the period the related premiums written are earned accordingly the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by gaap thus adjusted underwriting profit is a gaap measurement which can be viewed as gross margin or an intermediate subtotal in calculating operating income and net income dac is reviewed for recoverability and such review requires management judgment a major part of the discipline of a successful general insurance company is to produce an underwriting profit exclusive of investment income when underwriting is not profitable premiums are inadequate to pay for losses and expenses therefore investment income must be used to cover underwriting losses if assets and the income therefrom are insufficient to pay claims and expenses over extended periods an insurance company cannot survive for these reasons aig views and manages its underwriting operations separately from its investment operations see also the discussion under liquidity herein the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity regulation product type and competition have a direct impact on pricing and consequently profitability as reflected by adjusted underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios the effects of catastrophes incurred in the first three months of 2003 and 2002 were insignificant with respect to catastrophe losses aig believes that it has taken appropriate steps to reduce the magnitude of possible future losses the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity such as a terrorist attack earthquake or hurricane that causes insured losses however could have a material adverse effect on aigs results of operations liquidity or financial condition current techniques and models may not accurately predict in the future the probability of catastrophic events and the extent of the resulting losses moreover one or more catastrophe losses could impact negatively aigs reinsurers and result in an inability of aig to collect reinsurance recoverables the impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from period to period making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult general insurance net investment income in the first three months of 2003 increased 5 2 percent when compared to the same period of 2002 the cash flow resulting from the growth in net premiums written had a positive impact on net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein general insurance realized capital losses were 173 million and 122 million in the first three months of 2003 and 2002 respectively these realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing management of the general insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations and reflect continued weakness in the equity markets and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings see the discussion on valuation of invested assets herein the following table reconciles general insurance operating income on a gaap basis to managements presentation herein data table removed general insurance operating income for the first three months of 2003 increased 22 6 percent to 1 14 billion excluding realized capital gains losses general insurance operating income in 34 creased 24 8 percent over the same period of 2002 the contribution of general insurance operating income to income before income taxes and minority interest was 39 1 percent during the first three months of 2003 compared to 31 5 percent in the same period of 2002 excluding realized capital losses from income before income taxes and minority interest during the first three months of 2003 and 2002 the contribution of general insurance operating income was 37 0 percent and 33 1 percent respectively reinsurance aig is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations aig is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs aig insures general risks in over 70 countries and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide aig the level of reinsurance protection that aig desires these reinsurance arrangements do not relieve aig from its direct obligations to its insureds aigs general reinsurance assets amounted to 29 85 billion at march 31 2003 and resulted from aigs reinsurance arrangements thus a credit exposure existed at march 31 2003 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse aig under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements aig manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and when necessary aig holds substantial collateral in the form of funds securities and or irrevocable letters of credit this collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis at december 31 2002 approximately 40 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers in order to obtain statutory recognition the majority of these balances were collateralized the remaining 60 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers and over 90 percent of such balances are from reinsurers rated a excellent or better as rated by a m best through march 31 2003 these distribution percentages have not changed significantly this rating is a measure of financial strength the terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories not creditworthiness aigs allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance has not changed significantly from december 31 2002 when aig had allowances for unrecoverable reinsurance approximating 120 million at march 31 2003 aig had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled e g liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction aigs reinsurance security department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic such assessments include but are not limited to identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates this department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral in addition aigs credit risk committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer aig enters into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for its general and life operations aig enters these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among various legal entities these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation at march 31 2003 the consolidated general reinsurance assets of 29 85 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of 4 18 billion and 22 01 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses including ceded losses incurred but not reported ibnr ceded reserves the ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments thereto are reflected in income currently it is aigs belief that the ceded reserves at march 31 2003 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable in the future as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses the table below classifies as of march 31 2003 the components of the general insurance reserve for 35 losses and loss expenses loss reserves with respect to major lines of business on a statutory basis data table removed presented pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners these loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including ibnr and loss expenses certain of these loss reserves are discounted these discounted reserves relate primarily to certain workers compensation claims at march 31 2003 general insurance net loss reserves increased 1 17 billion from prior year end to 31 52 billion the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently it is managements belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as at march 31 2003 while aig annually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of march 31 2003 in the future if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations in a very broad sense the general loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups one group being long tail casualty lines of business such lines include excess and umbrella liability directors and officers liability professional liability medical malpractice general liability products liability and related classes the other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses net losses for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors including the line and volume of the business involved in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines there is limited statistical credibility in reported net losses that is a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid a relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be ibnr a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines these methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next for the majority of long tail casualty lines net loss trend factors approximated six percent loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling exposure and policy forms current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards thus many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs therefore aigs carried net long tail loss reserves are judgmentally set as well as tested for reasonableness using the most appropriate loss trend factors for each class of business in the evaluation of aigs net loss reserves loss trend factors vary depending on the particular class and nature of the business involved these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted as appropriate to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience estimation of net losses for short tail business is less complex than for long tail casualty lines loss cost trends for many property lines can generally be assumed to be similar to the growth in exposure of such lines for example if the fire insurance coverage remained proportional to the actual value of the property the growth in the propertys exposure to fire loss can be approximated by the amount of insurance purchased aigs annual reserve review does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates because aigs general insurance business is primarily in volatile long tail casualty lines driven almost entirely by severity rather than frequency of claims developing 36 a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful an estimate is calculated which aigs actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve this amount is evaluated against actual carried reserves it should also be noted that the overall aig property casualty reserves are the combined total of dozens of insurance company subsidiaries of aig each subsidiarys reserves are generally reviewed individually except in some cases where the business is written on a pooled basis and the subsidiaries therefore pool their reserves as well a number of actuarial assumptions are made in the review of reserves for each individual segment for segments in longer tail lines of business actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following 1 loss development factors used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis 2 loss trend factors used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years 3 expected loss ratios for the latest accident year i e accident year 2002 for the year end 2002 loss reserve analysis and in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years adjusted for the loss trend see 2 above and the impact of rate changes and all other factors which can be quantified for low frequency high severity classes such as excess casualty and directors and officers liability expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years to the extent the actual loss development factors loss trend factors or other factors used to establish expected loss ratios differ from those assumed in aigs loss reserve studies aigs loss reserve position would be directly impacted while it may be possible to assume loss reserve ranges for high frequency shorter tail classes of business it is aigs judgment that the concept of a meaningful loss reserve range does not apply to low frequency high severity long tail classes such as excess casualty and directors and officers liability d and o the past decade has shown that actual loss trends from year to year and the resulting adequacy of expected loss ratios and of the resulting carried loss reserves cannot reasonably be expected to fall within any particular range for example loss costs nearly doubled during just a three accident year period for aigs excess casualty and d and o segments while loss costs for these same two classes actually declined for several years in the early 1990s the causes of the spike in loss costs include irrational jury awards and liability inflation that could not have been anticipated in pricing tort system out of control an explosion in medical costs and related liabilities and the dot com bubble and corporate governance related issues that have affected d and o additionally it is important to note that most of aigs business falls into the category of longer tail lines of business due to the multitude of such classes and the volume of detail for each it would not be possible to provide complete claim frequency settlement closure and other data for all such segments nor does aig believe that such disclosure by class of business would be meaningful or useful to the reader it should be noted that none of the other segments or classes reflects the highly uncertain qualities that apply to the asbestos and environmental claims as more fully described below for example traditional actuarial methodologies can be applied to classes such as excess casualty directors and officers liability healthcare and the other long tail coverages that aig writes these methodologies cannot be applied to asbestos and environmental exposures other than asbestos and environmental exposures there is no area of significant exposure to aig for which traditional actuarial methodologies cannot be applied for other property and short tail casualty lines the loss trend is implicitly assumed to develop at the rate that reported net losses develop from one year to the next the concerns noted above for longer tail casualty lines with respect to the limited statistical credibility of reported net losses generally do not apply to shorter tail lines asbestos and environmental claims aig continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste hazardous substances and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites hereinafter referred to collectively as environ 37 mental claims and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years aig established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claim units which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims these units utilize a comprehensive ground up approach to claim adjusting by thoroughly evaluating each exposure on a claim by claim basis commencing in 1985 standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented however aig currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and excluded such claims from the analyses included herein estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a difficult process these asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by conventional reserving techniques as previously described quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including managerial judgment significant factors which affect the trends which influence the development of asbestos and environmental claims are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage the current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future additionally the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involves issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties in the interim aig and other industry members have and will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues at the current time it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is the case for other types of claims such development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage as they have in the past as well as by the changes in superfund and waste dump site coverage issues although the estimated liabilities for these claims are subject to a significantly greater margin of error than for other claims the reserves carried for these claims at march 31 2003 are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law furthermore as aigs net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves in the future if the environmental claims develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations see the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein the majority of aigs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages not primary coverages thus the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves that is litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability aig incurs individual significant claim liabilities where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable are established on a case basis in asbestos for example aig has resolved all claims with respect to miners and product manufacturers tier i for which payments are completed or reserves are established to cover future payment obligations asbestos claims with respect to products containing asbestos tier 2 accounts are generally very mature losses and have been appropriately recognized and reserved by aigs asbestos claims operation aig believes that the vast majority of the incoming claims with respect to products containing small amounts of asbestos and companies in the distribution chain and parties with remote ill defined involvement with asbestos tier 3 and 4 should not impact its coverage this is due to a combination of factors including the increasingly peripheral companies being named in asbestos litigation smaller limits issued to peripheral defendants tenuous liability cases against peripheral defendants attachment points of the excess policies and the manner in which resolution of these weaker cases would be allocated among all insurers including non aig companies over a long period of time a summary of reserve activity for the three months ended march 31 2003 and 2002 including estimates for applicable ibnr relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined is as follows data table removed 38 data table removed all amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years the gross and net ibnr included in the aforementioned reserve for losses and loss expenses at march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 were estimated as follows in millions data table removed a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity for the three month periods ended march 31 2003 and 2002 was as follows data table removed a m best an insurance rating agency has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that companys current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments this is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years therefore the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments the higher the ratio the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments these ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlements during the fiscal year such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments it should be noted however that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves ultimate payments thereof and the resultant ratio the developed survival ratios include both involuntary and voluntary indemnity payments involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments court orders covered claims with no coverage defenses state mandated cleanup costs claims where aigs coverage defenses are minimal and settlements made less than six months before the first trial setting also aig considers all legal and loss adjustment payments as involuntary aig believes voluntary indemnity payments should be excluded from the survival ratio the special asbestos and environmental claims unit actively manages aigs asbestos and environmental claims and proactively pursues early settlement of environmental claims for all known and unknown sites as a result aig reduces its exposure to future environmental loss contingencies aigs survival ratios for involuntary asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average pay 39 ment these ratios at march 31 2003 and 2002 were as follows data table removed aigs operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states as a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state aig generally records these assessments upon notice additionally certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities therefore the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated the guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2002 were 76 million based upon current information aig does not anticipate that its net assessment will be significantly different in 2003 aig is also required to participate in various involuntary pools principally workers compensation business which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets this participation is also recorded upon notification as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated life insurance operations aigs

insurance operating income to income before income taxes and minority interest amounted to 40 9 percent during the first three months of 2003 compared to 44 8 percent in the same period of 2002 excluding realized capital losses from income before income taxes and minority interest during the first three months of 2003 and 2002 the contribution of life insurance operating income was 43 3 percent and 42 5 percent respectively aigs gaap life premium income during the first three months of 2003 represented an 18 3 percent increase from the same period in 2002 foreign life operations produced 76 6 percent and 77 4 percent of the gaap life premium income in 2003 and 2002 respectively the traditional life products particularly individual life products were major contributors to the growth in foreign premium income these tradi 41 tional life products coupled with the increased distribution of financial and investment products contributed to the growth in foreign investment income a mixture of traditional accident and health and financial products are being sold in japan through alico and aig star life since aig purchased aig star life a part of income earned by aig star life has resulted from surrender charges earned on policies that were either surrendered or lapsed this favorable impact on operating income was anticipated when aig took control as these surrenders diminish in subsequent periods operating income from that source will also be impacted the majority of aig star lifes future income is expected to be related to continuing premiums paid on renewal business and new business to be generated from a growing agency force as previously discussed the u s dollar weakened slightly in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly for the first three months of 2003 when foreign life premium income was translated into u s dollars for purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total life premium income was approximately 2 6 percentage points more than it would have been if translated utilizing average exchange rates prevailing in 2002 life insurance net investment income increased 11 6 percent during the first three months of 2003 the growth in net investment income was primarily attributable to both foreign and domestic new cash flow for investment the new cash flow was generated from life insurance operations and included the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income see also the discussion under liquidity herein life insurance realized capital losses for the first three months were 345 million in 2003 and 29 million in 2002 these realized capital losses resulted from the ongoing management of the life insurance investment portfolios within the overall objectives of the life insurance operations and reflect continued weakness in the equity markets and impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings see the discussion on valuation of invested assets herein underwriting and investment risk the risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk the risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is primarily investment risk underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality morbidity termination and expenses aigs foreign life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately 1 5 million of coverage and aigs domestic life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to 2 5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance the investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets primarily long term fixed rate investments being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments to minimize its exposure to investment risk aig tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit if a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur a demand could be placed upon liquidity see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs foreign operations as it has been throughout aigs history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities for example in japan and several southeast asia territories the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities additionally there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities 42 to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts while continuing to maintain satisfactory investment quality to the extent permitted under local regulation aig may invest in qualified longer term securities outside japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield aig is able to manage any asset liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs domestic operations as there is ample supply of qualified long term investments aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes for the alico operations in japan the variable life contract separate account fund performance has varied from the level assumed in the original pricing of the product thus a general account liability has been established for the potential shortfall of future contract revenues the ultimate liability is predominately dependent upon the fund performance in the future deferred policy acquisition costs dac for life insurance products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new or renewal business policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy policy acquisition costs which relate to universal life and investment type products non traditional life products are deferred and amortized with interest in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less interest required as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the impact on the amortization of dac the estimation of projected gross profits requires significant management judgment the elements with respect to the current and projected gross profits are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are appropriately adjusted dac for both traditional life and non traditional life products are subject to review for recoverability which involve estimating the future profitability of current business this review also involves significant management judgment financial services operations aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft leasing consumer and

percent in the first three months of 2003 over the same period of 2002 financial services operating income represented 18 1 percent of aigs income before income taxes and minority interest in the first three months of 2003 this compares to 16 0 percent in the same period of 2002 ilfc generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account for airlines and for financial institutions revenues in the first three months of 2003 increased 12 7 percent from the same period of 2002 the revenue growth resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment under operating lease and the increase in the relative cost of the leased fleet ilfc has historically derived over 80 percent of its lease revenues with respect to flight equipment from airlines based outside the united states and is not significantly exposed to current domestic airline difficulties ilfc has historically re leased aircraft returning at lease termination prior to aircraft being returned to ilfc for aircraft returning due to early lease termination ilfc has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to three months of its return as a lessor ilfc considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent ilfc had one aircraft off lease at march 31 2003 which had been off lease for less than three months no impairments have been recognized related to these aircraft as ilfc believes that the existing service potential of the aircraft in ilfcs portfolio has not been diminished and ilfc has been able to re lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates from those previously obtained that would require an impairment write down ilfc management is very active in the airline industry management formally reviews regularly and no less frequently than quarterly issues affecting ilfcs fleet including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft values management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary based on these events and circumstances in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 144 no impairments have been recognized related to these aircraft see also the discussions under liquidity herein during the first three months of 2003 operating income increased 0 7 percent from the same period of 2002 ilfc finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments the composite borrowing rates at the end of the first three months of 2003 and 2002 were 4 57 percent and 4 93 percent respectively see also the discussions under capital resources and liquidity herein and note 2 of notes to financial statements ilfc is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through non performance of aircraft lessees through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease ilfc manages its lessee non performance exposure through credit reviews and security deposit requirements as a result of these measures and its own contingency planning ilfc did not suffer any material losses from airline shutdowns in the aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks but there can be no assurance that ilfc will successfully manage the risks relating to the impact of possible future deterioration in the airline industry approximately 86 percent of ilfcs fleet is leased to non u s carriers and this fleet the most efficient in the airline industry continues to be in high demand from such carriers 44 see also the discussions under capital resources and liquidity herein aigfp participates in the derivatives dealer market conducting primarily as principal an interest rate currency equity and credit derivative products business aigfp also enters into structured transactions including long dated forward foreign exchange contracts option transactions liquidity facilities and investment agreements and invests in a diversified portfolio of securities aigfp derives substantially all its revenues from proprietary positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions as a dealer aigfp marks its transactions daily to fair value thus a gain or loss on each transaction is recognized daily aigfp hedges the market risks arising from its transactions therefore revenues and operating income are not significantly exposed to or affected by market fluctuations and volatility revenues of aigfp and the percentage change in revenues for any given period are significantly affected by the number and size of transactions entered into by aigfp during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period operating income and the percentage change in operating income for any period are determined by the number size and profitability of the transactions attributable to that period relative to those attributable to the prior period the realization of operating income as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the profit or loss on each of aigfps transactions has already been reflected in operating income revenues in the first three months of 2003 decreased 0 1 percent from the same period of 2002 during the first three months of 2003 operating income increased 11 2 percent from the same period of 2002 as aigfp is a transaction oriented operation current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance the breakdown by percentage contribution of revenues and operating income for aigfp in the first three months of 2003 and 2002 is set forth below the percentages for operating income are the same as those for revenues because expenses are allocated across all products in proportion to the revenues generated by that product material changes in the distribution of revenues and operating income are not meaningful because of the transactional nature of aigfps business data table removed financial market conditions in the first three months of 2003 compared with the comparable period in 2002 were characterized by lower interest rates across fixed income markets globally a worldwide slump in credit prices combined with a widening of credit spreads and lower equity valuations derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of aigfps business therefore income on interest rate equity and credit derivatives along with their related hedges are recorded on a mark to market value or at estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the income statement in the current year in the first three months of 2003 less than five percent of revenues resulted from transactions valued at estimated fair value the mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the captions unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions and unrealized loss on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions the unrealized gain represents the aggregate of each net receivable by counterparty and the unrealized loss represents the aggregate of each net payable by counterparty these amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates currency rates equity prices and other market variables as well as cash movements execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions spread income on investments and borrowings are recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the transaction investments are classified as available for sale securities and are marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the equity section the most significant component of aigfps operating expenses is compensation which approximated 29 percent and 32 percent of revenues in the first three months of 2003 and 2002 respectively domestically aigs consumer finance operations derive a substantial portion of their revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding mortgages and finance receivables from the sub prime market while overseas operations are engaged in 45 developing a multi product consumer finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets revenues increased 4 2 percent in the first three months of 2003 from the same period in 2002 operating income increased 19 1 percent compared to the 2002

generated approximately 4 1 billion in investment income cash flow during the first three months of 2003 investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses with respect to general insurance operations if paid losses accelerated beyond aigs ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows aig would need to liquidate a portion of its general insurance investment portfolio and or arrange for financing potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable decreased significantly in value see also the discussions under operational review general insurance operations herein with respect to life insurance operations if a substantial portion of the life insurance operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and or defaulted aig would need to liquidate other portions of its life insurance investment portfolio and or arrange financing potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which aig life insurance operations exist nationalization terrorist acts or other such economic or political upheaval see also the discussions under operational review life insurance operations herein in addition to the combined insurance pre tax operating cash flow aigs insurance operations held 13 54 billion in cash and short term investments at march 31 2003 operating cash flow and the cash and short term balances held provided aigs insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity this liquidity is available among other things to purchase predominantly high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate policy loans and collateral loans this cash flow coupled with proceeds of 52 approximately 38 billion from the maturities sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity

investments with respect to fixed maturities aigs general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer industry and or country concentrations with respect to general insurance aigs strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase with respect to life insurance aigs strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities see also the discussion under operational review life insurance operations herein the fair value of the fixed maturity available for sale portfolio is subject to decline as interest rates rise and is subject to increase as interest rates decline such changes in fair value are presented as a component of comprehensive income in unrealized appreciation of investments net of taxes credit quality at march 31 2003 approximately 69 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities approximately 32 percent of such domestic securities were rated aaa by one or more of the principal rating agencies approximately 10 percent were below investment grade or not rated a significant portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio is rated by moodys standard and poors s and p or similar foreign services similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations aig annually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments including mortgages at march 31 2003 approximately 17 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated aaa or on the basis of aigs internal analysis were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated approximately 11 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date a large portion of the foreign insurance fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date equity investments aig invests in equities for various reasons including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk equity securities are subject to declines in fair value such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments net of taxes as a component of comprehensive income valuation of invested assets the valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market value for each security the source for the market value is generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of non traded securities another aspect of valuation is an assessment of impairment as a matter of policy the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of aigs management and a continual review of its investments in general a security is considered a candidate for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant discount to par amortized cost if lower or cost for an extended period of time the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation or ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or in the opinion of aigs management it is unlikely that aig will realize a full recovery on its investment irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events once a security has been identified as potentially impaired the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price however the market price following a significant credit event of any issuer may 54 be volatile after such an event factors such as market liquidity hedge fund activity sensitivity to headline risk and the widening of bid ask spreads contribute to price volatility because of such volatility the market price may not be indicative of the fair value of such an investment and consequently not indicative of a reasonable estimate of realizable value aig has the ability to hold any security to its stated maturity therefore the decision to sell reflects the judgment of aigs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale as a result of these policies aig recorded in the first three months of 2003 impairment losses net of taxes of approximately 479 million no impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to aigs consolidated financial condition or results of operations and no individual impairment loss exceeded 1 6 percent of consolidated net income for the first three months of 2003 excluding the impairments noted above the changes in market value for aigs available for sale portfolio which constitutes the vast majority of aigs investments were recorded in equity as unrealized gains or losses at march 31 2003 the unrealized losses after taxes of the fixed maturity securities were approximately 2 5 billion at march 31 2003 the unrealized losses after taxes of the equity securities portfolio were approximately 426 million at march 31 2003 aggregate unrealized gains after taxes were 11 2 billion and aggregate unrealized losses after taxes were 2 9 billion no single issuer accounted for more than three percent of the unrealized losses at march 31 2003 the fair value of aigs fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated to 264 1 billion of this aggregate fair value 1 0 percent represented securities trading at or below 75 percent of amortized cost or cost the impact on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be further mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholders accounts or realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs at march 31 2003 the unrealized losses after taxes for fixed maturity securities and equity securities included the following industry concentrations data table removed the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at march 31 2003 by contractual maturity is shown below data table removed in the three months ended march 31 2003 the pre tax realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were 2 5 billion the aggregate fair value of securities sold was 35 0 billion which was approximately 93 percent of amortized cost the average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the quarter ended march 31 2003 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately seven months 55 the aging of pre tax unrealized loss positions at march 31 2003 is shown below data table removed as more fully described above upon realization certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts or realization will result in a current decrease in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs note at march 31 2003 aggregate pre tax unrealized gains were 17 3 billion as stated previously the valuation for aigs investment portfolio comes from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of non traded securities aig considers non traded securities to mean certain fixed income investments certain structured securities direct private equities limited partnerships and hedge funds the aggregate carrying value of these securities at march 31 2003 was approximately 34 0 billion the methodology used to estimate fair value of non traded fixed income investments is by reference to traded securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology this technique takes into account such factors as the industry the securitys rating and tenor its coupon rate its position in the capital structure of the issuer and other relevant factors the change in fair value is recognized as a component of unrealized appreciation for certain structured securities the carrying value is based on an estimate of the securitys future cash flows pursuant to the requirements of emerging issues task force issue no 99 20 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets the change in carrying value is recognized in income direct private equities hedge funds and limited partnerships in which aig holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair value the change in fair value is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income with respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which aig holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest aigs carrying value is the net asset value the changes in such net asset values are recorded in income aig obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the sponsors of each of these investments the accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis each of these investment categories is regularly tested to determine if impairment in value exists various valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in this determination mortgage investments mortgage loans on real estate policy and collateral loans comprised 5 6 percent of aigs insurance invested assets at march 31 2003 aigs insurance operations holdings of real estate mortgages amounted to 11 57 billion of which 87 6 percent was domestic at march 31 2003 only a nominal amount was in default it is aigs practice to maintain a maximum loan to value ratio of 75 percent at loan origination at march 31 2003 aigs insurance holdings of collateral loans amounted to 1 40 billion all of which were foreign it is aigs strategy to enter into mortgage and collateral loans as an adjunct primarily to life insurance fixed maturity investments aigs policy loans increased from 6 05 billion at december 31 2002 to 6 06 billion at march 31 2003 short term investments short term investments represent amounts invested in various internal and external money market funds time deposits and cash held real estate investments aigs real estate investment properties are primarily occupied by aigs various operations the current market value of these properties considerably exceeds their carrying value 56 other investments other invested assets were primarily comprised of limited partnerships and hedge funds when permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets including invested assets from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aig and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users see also the discussion under derivatives herein in certain jurisdictions significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance subsidiaries or from the insurance subsidiaries to aig parent these barriers generally cause only minor delays in the outward remittance of the funds managing market risk aigs insurance operations are exposed to market risk market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices measuring potential losses in fair values has recently become the focus of risk management efforts by many companies such measurements are performed through the application of various statistical techniques one such technique is value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that uses historical interest and foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices and estimates the volatility and correlation of each of these rates and prices to calculate the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability aig believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management aig has performed a var analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of aigs insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment in this analysis financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses reserve for unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders funds due to the nature of each insurance segment aig manages the general and life insurance operations separately as a result aig manages separately the invested assets of each accordingly the var analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance operations aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aigs insurance segments as of march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 aig uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re pricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period in this case the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios for each scenario each transaction was re priced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the final var number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with 95 percent confidence i e only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure a one month holding period was assumed in computing the var figure 57 the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 var with respect to combined operations cannot be derived by aggregating the individual risk or segment amounts presented herein in millions data table removed the following table

under operational review financial services operations capital resources and derivatives herein data table removed as previously discussed the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ilfcs debt financings the primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the prior debt during the first three months of 2003 ilfc acquired flight equipment costing 1 76 billion see also the discussion under operational re 58 view financial services operations and capital resources herein ilfc is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates as of march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 aig statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a var model in this analysis the net fair value of ilfc was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt the estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of ilfc using the historical simulation methodology as previously described as of march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 the average var with respect to the aforementioned net fair value of ilfc was approximately 8 million and 20 million respectively aigs consumer finance operations provide a wide variety of consumer finance products both domestically and overseas such products include real estate mortgages consumer loans and retail sales finance these products are funded through various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes aigs consumer finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates over half of the loan balance is related to real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties with respect to credit losses the allowance for finance receivable losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio aigfps derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available aigfp reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps trading securities options forwards and futures the estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows these transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if aigfp were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that the impact of any such limited liquidity would not be significant to aigs financial condition or its overall liquidity see also the discussion under operational review financial services operations and derivatives herein aigfp uses the proceeds from the issuance of notes and bonds and gia borrowings to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities including securities available for sale at market and derivative transactions the funds may also be temporarily invested in securities purchased under agreements to resell the proceeds from the disposal of the aforementioned securities available for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell have been used to fund the maturing gias or other aigfp financings see also the discussion under capital resources herein securities available for sale is mainly a portfolio of debt securities where the individual securities have varying degrees of credit risk at march 31 2003 the average credit rating of this portfolio was aa or the equivalent thereto as determined through rating agencies or internal review aigfp has also entered into credit derivative transactions to hedge its credit risk associated with 66 million of these securities securities deemed below investment grade at march 31 2003 amounted to approximately 100 million in fair value representing 0 6 of one percent of the total aigfp securities available for sale 30 million of this amount is hedged with a credit derivative there have been no significant downgrades through may 1 2003 securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized transactions aigfp takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell aigfp further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and when aigfp deems necessary it requires additional collateral to be deposited trading securities at market value are marked to market daily and are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of aigfp aigfp is exposed to credit risk if its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform aigfp could have a liquidity strain aig guarantees aigfps debt and as a result is responsible for all of aigfps obligations aigtg conducts as principal market making and trading activities in foreign exchange and com 59 modities primarily precious and base metals aigtg owns inventories in the commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps forwards futures and option contracts aigtg uses derivatives to manage the economic exposure of its various trading positions and transactions from adverse movements of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices aigtg supports its trading activities largely through trading liabilities unrealized losses on swaps short term borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities and commodities sold but not yet purchased see also the discussions under capital resources and derivatives herein the gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses of aigfp and aigtg included in the financial services assets and liabilities at march 31 2003 were as follows in millions data table removed a these amounts are also presented as the respective balance sheet amounts b at march 31 2003 aigtgs replacement values with respect to interest rate and currency swaps were 610 million aigfps interest rate and currency risks on securities available for sale at market are managed by taking offsetting positions on a security by security basis thereby offsetting a significant portion of the unrealized appreciation or depreciation at march 31 2003 the unrealized gains and losses remaining after the benefit of the offsets were 76 million and 121 million respectively trading securities at market value and securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased at market value are marked to market daily with the unrealized gain or loss being recognized in income at that time these securities are held to meet the short term risk management objectives of aigfp and aigtg the senior management of aig defines the policies and establishes general operating parameters for aigfp and aigtg aigs senior management has established various oversight committees to review the various financial market operational and credit issues of aigfp and aigtg the senior managements of aigfp and aigtg report the results of their respective operations to and review future strategies with aigs senior management aig actively manages the exposures to limit potential losses while maximizing the rewards afforded by these business opportunities in doing so aig must continually manage a variety of exposures including credit market liquidity operational and legal risks managing market risk market risk arises principally from the uncertainty that future earnings are exposed to potential changes in volatility interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig generally controls its exposure to market risk by taking offsetting positions aigs philosophy with respect to its financial services operations is to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered positions that are to be carried credit risk exposure is separately managed see the discussion on the management of credit risk below aigs market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aigs market exposures particularly those market exposures of aigfp and aigtg this department determines whether aigs market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aigs senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates 60 and the shape and slope of the yield curve aigfp hedges its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into transactions such as interest rate swaps and options and purchasing u s and foreign government obligations aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates aigfp hedges its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through the use of currency swaps options forwards and futures aigfp is exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices which affect the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular stock a basket of stocks or a stock index aigfp reduces the risk of loss inherent in its inventory in equity securities by entering into hedging transactions including equity swaps and options and purchasing u s and foreign government obligations aigfp does not seek to manage the market risk of each of its transactions through an individual offsetting transaction rather aigfp takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposure aigfp values its portfolio including interest rate swaps currency swaps equity swaps swaptions options and forwards at market value or estimated fair value when market values are not readily available unrealized gains and losses with respect to this portfolio are reflected in income currently these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of aigfps transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfps and aigs management aigfp evaluates the portfolios discounted cash flows with reference to current market conditions maturities within the portfolio and other relevant factors estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models these models utilize among other things market liquidity and current interest foreign exchange and volatility rates aigfp attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices such as published exchange prices external subscription services such as from bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available aigfp uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions historically actual results have not materially deviated from these models these valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio as described above in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio based upon this evaluation aigfp determines what if any offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio aig manages its market risk with a variety of transactions including swaps trading securities futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate the recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if aigfp were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations financial condition or liquidity such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity additionally depending upon the changes in interest rates and other market movements during the day aigfps system will produce reports for managements consideration for intra day offsetting positions overnight the system generates reports which recommend the types of offsets management should consider for the following day additionally aigfp operates in major business centers overseas and is essentially open for business 24 hours a day thus the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored reviewed and coordinated around the clock therefore offsetting adjustments can be made as and when necessary from any aigfp office in the world as part of its monitoring and controlling of its exposure to market risk aigfp applies various testing techniques which reflect potential market movements these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio in addition to the daily monitoring aigfps senior management and local risk managers conduct a weekly review of the derivatives portfolio and existing hedges this review includes an examination of the portfolios risk measures such as aggregate option sensitivity to movements in market variables aigfps management may change these measures to reflect their judgment and evaluation of the dynamics of the markets this management group will also determine whether additional or alternative action is required in order to manage the portfolio all of aigtgs market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for trading purposes the fair 61 values of aigtgs financial instruments are exposed to market risk as a result of adverse market changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and adverse changes in the liquidity of the markets in which aigtg trades aigtgs approach to managing market risk is to establish an appropriate offsetting position to a particular transaction or group of transactions depending upon the extent of market risk aigtg expects to reduce aigtgs senior management has established positions and stop loss limits for each line of business aigtgs traders are required to maintain positions within these limits these positions are monitored during the day either manually and or through on line computer systems in addition these positions are reviewed by aigtgs management reports which present each trading books position and the prior days profit and loss are reviewed by traders head traders and aigtgs senior management based upon these and other reports aigtgs senior management may determine to adjust aigtgs risk profile aigtg attempts to secure reliable current market prices such as published prices or third party quotes to value its derivatives where such prices are not available aigtg uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions historically actual results have not materially deviated from these models the methodology may reflect interest and exchange rates commodity prices volatility rates market liquidity and other relevant factors unrealized gains and losses with respect to aigtgs positions are reflected in income currently a significant portion of aigtgs business is transacted in liquid markets certain of aigtgs derivative product exposures are evaluated using simulation techniques which consider such factors as changes in currency and commodity prices interest rates volatility levels market liquidity and the effect of time aigfp and aigtg are both exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a var model aig separately calculated the var with respect to aigfp and aigtg as aig manages these operations separately aigfps and aigtgs asset and liability portfolios for which the var analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments derivative instruments and commodities because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale at market is substantially hedged segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary aig calculated the var with respect to aigfp and aigtg as of march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 aig uses the historical simulation methodology which entails re pricing all assets

and low vars on a combined basis and of each component of aigfps and aigtgs market risk as of march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 in millions data table removed derivatives derivatives are financial arrangements among two or more parties the returns of the derivatives are linked to or derived from some underlying equity debt commodity or other asset liability or index derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities certain commodities or financial or commodity indices the more significant types of derivative arrangements in which aig transacts are swaps forwards futures and options in the normal course of business with the agreement of the original counterparty these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty the overwhelming majority of aigs derivatives activities are conducted through aigfp and aigtg thus permitting aig to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal in these derivative operations aig structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices aigs customers such as corporations financial institutions multinational organizations sovereign entities government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures for example a futures forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations a counterparty may default on any obligation to aig including a derivative contract credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to aig to help manage this risk the credit departments of aigfp and aigtg operate within the guidelines set by the aig credit risk committee this committee establishes the credit policy sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings in addition to credit ratings this committee takes into account other factors including the industry and country of the counterparty transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the aig credit risk committee it is also aigs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary aigfp and aigtg determine the credit quality of each of their counterparties taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized statis 63 tical rating organizations if it is determined that a counterparty requires credit enhancement then one or more enhancement techniques will be used examples of such enhancement techniques include letters of credit guarantees collateral credit triggers credit derivatives and margin agreements a significant majority of aigfps transactions are contracted and documented under isda master agreements management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set off in the event of default also under such agreements in connection with a counterparty desiring to terminate a contract prior to maturity aigfp may be permitted to set off its receivables from that counterparty against aigfps payables to that same counterparty arising out of all included transactions excluding regulated exchange transactions aigtg whenever possible enters into netting agreements

gain on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions in the accompanying balance sheet aigtg determines counterparty credit quality by reference to ratings from independent rating agencies or where such ratings are not available internal analysis at march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 the concentration of credit exposure with respect to counterparties judged a or higher by aigtg was 63 percent and 75 percent respectively 65 also as of march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 the counterparty credit quality and counterparty breakdown by industry with respect to the net replacement value of aigtgs derivatives portfolio were as follows in millions data table removed exchange traded futures and options are not deemed to have significant credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee that every contract will be properly settled on a daily basis fair value source the fair value sources of the net replacement values of aigfps derivatives portfolio were based on valuation models although these models are proprietary the inputs were obtained from independently published exchange prices external subscription services prices such as bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in these models in the minimal instances when such prices are not available aigfp uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions at march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 the fair value source of the net replacement value of aigtgs derivatives portfolio was as follows in millions data table removed notional amounts the notional amounts used to express the extent of aigfps and aigtgs involvement in swap transactions represent a standard of measurement of the volume of aigfps and aigtgs swaps business notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received except for certain contracts such as currency swaps 66 the timing and the amount of cash flows relating to aigfps and aigtgs foreign exchange forwards and exchange traded futures and options contracts are determined by each of the respective contractual agreements the following table presents the contractual and notional amounts by maturity and type of derivatives of aigfps derivatives portfolio at march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 in millions data table removed notional amount is not representative of either market risk or credit risk aigfp enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary course of its business the overwhelming majority of aigfps credit derivatives require aigfp to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities aigfp provides such credit protection only on a second loss basis under which aigfps payment obligations arise only after credit losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold amount or level of first losses the threshold amount of credit losses that must be realized before aigfp has any payment obligation is negotiated by aigfp for each transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment obligation by aigfp under each transaction is remote even in severe recessionary market scenarios in many cases the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies typically there will be an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio and then successive layers that are rated generally a bbb rated layer an a rated layer an aa rated layer and an aaa rated layer in transactions that are rated the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior to the threshold level above which aigfps payment obligation would arise is rated aaa by the rating agencies for that reason the risk layer assumed by aigfp with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions is often called the super senior risk layer defined as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been rated aaa by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated equivalent thereto for example in a transaction with an equity layer covering credit losses from 0 to 2 percent of the total portfolio a bbb rated layer covering credit losses from 2 to 4 percent an a rated layer from 4 to 6 percent an aa rated layer from 6 to 8 percent and an aaa rated layer from 8 to 11 percent aigfp would cover credit losses arising in respect of the portfolio that exceed an 11 percent first loss threshold amount and thereby bear risk that is senior to the 8 to 11 percent aaa rated risk layer aigfp continually monitors the underlying portfolios to determine whether the credit loss experience for any particular portfolio has caused the likelihood of aigfp having a payment obligation under the transaction to be greater than super senior risk aigfp maintains the ability opportunistically to hedge specific securities in a portfolio thereby further limiting its exposure to loss and has hedged outstanding transactions in this manner on occasion aigfp has never had a payment obligation under these credit derivatives transactions furthermore based on portfolio credit losses experienced to date under all outstanding transactions no transaction has experienced credit losses in an amount that has made the likelihood of aigfp having to make a payment in aigfps view to be greater than 67 remote even in severe recessionary market scenarios at march 31 2003 the notional amount with respect to aigfps credit derivative portfolio was 151 1 billion the following table provides the contractual and notional amounts by maturity and type of derivative of aigtgs derivatives portfolio at march 31 2003 and december 31 2002 in millions data table removed a sold options obligate aigtg to buy or sell the underlying item if the option purchaser chooses to exercise the amounts do not represent credit exposure b notional amount is not representative of either market risk or credit risk in addition to its role as derivatives dealer through aigfp and aigtg aig and its subsidiaries including its insurance subsidiaries use derivatives primarily to minimize aigs asset liability exposure and foreign currency and interest rate exposures these transactions are generally executed with aigfp and aigtg as counterparty who in turn hedge these transactions in the market place thus aigfp and aigtg assume the credit risk exposure aig also uses derivatives to help match assets and liabilities in several of its businesses including its insurance operations for example aig can use currency and interest rate swaps to convert foreign currency investment contract liabilities into u s dollar based exposures thus these liabilities are more properly matched with u s dollar assets in life insurance aig uses swaps to reduce the mismatch between long dated life insurance liabilities and shorter dated local currency assets swaps also enable aig to balance its asset and liability durations in consumer finance operations aigs derivatives review committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction the committee examines among other things the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction its potential credit exposure if any and the estimated benefits this committee does not review those derivative transactions entered into by aigfp and aigtg for their own accounts generally aig conducts its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment thus exchange gains or losses occur when aigs foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the u s dollar from one reporting period to the next legal risk arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability through legal or judicial processes of the obligations of aigs clients and counterparties including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the netting of mutual obligations see also the discussion on master netting agreements above accounting standards in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 142 as of january 1 2002 aig adopted fas 142 fas 142 requires aig to discontinue the amortization of goodwill in its consolidated income statement fas 142 requires goodwill to be subject to an assessment of impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate that a possible impairment has occurred the assessment 68 of impairment involves a two step process prescribed in fas 142 whereby an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed followed by a measurement of the amount of impairment if any fas 142 also requires the completion of a transitional impairment test in the year of adoption with any identified impairments recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles during the second quarter aig completed its transitional impairment test for 2002 resulting in no impairment changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are primarily caused as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments in november 2002 fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin45 fin45 requires that for guarantees within its scope that are issued or amended after december 31 2002 a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee be established and recognized through earnings fin45 also requires additional disclosures in financial statements starting with aigs 2002 year end financial statements aig guarantees the indebtedness of third parties principally in connection with aig sunamericas investments in affordable housing properties the guarantees are issued primarily to facilitate financing for the construction of the underlying properties and range in duration of up to ten years the loans are secured by the underlying real estate since the inception of this investment program over ten years ago payments under these guarantees have been insignificant this is due to the fact that the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner and secondly are secured by the underlying properties the maximum exposure under these guarantees as of march 31 2003 is approximately 3 4 billion in addition aigs real estate investment operations will occasionally extend similar guarantees to real estate partnerships in which they are an investor the guarantees facilitate financing for the construction and or purchase of land there have been no payments to date under these guarantees this is due to the fact that the loans are first backed by the creditworthiness of the third party general partner and secondly are secured by the underlying properties the maximum exposure under these guarantees as of march 31 2003 is approximately 70 million through its ilfc subsidiary aig has also provided other types of guarantees from time to time ilfc participates with airlines banks and other financial institutions to assist in financing aircraft by providing asset guarantees put options or loan guarantees historically losses arising from these guarantees have been immaterial as ilfc has recourse to the value of the underlying aircraft which offsets ilfcs exposure should ilfc be called upon to fulfill its obligations under these guarantees the maximum exposure of these guarantees as of march 31 2003 is approximately 1 0 billion in january 2003 fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities fin46 fin46 changes the method of determining whether certain entities should be consolidated in aigs consolidated financial statements an entity is subject to fin46 and is called a variable interest entity vie if it has i equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entitys operations or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity all other entities are evaluated for consolidation under existing guidance a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary which is the party that has a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of the vie or both the provisions of fin46 are to be applied immediately to vies created after january 31 2003 and to vies in which aig obtains an interest after that date for vies in which aig holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 fin46 applies to the fiscal quarter ended september 30 2003 for any vie that must be consolidated under fin46 that were created before february 1 2003 the assets liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie would be initially measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change aig is currently evaluating the impact of applying fin46 to existing vies in which it has a variable interest and believes that the impact on its results of operations and financial condition will not 69 be significant see also the discussion under special purpose vehicles included herein effective january 1 2003 aig adopted the recognition provision of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stock based compensation fas 123 this statement establishes the financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans such as aigs stock purchase plan stock option plan and stock incentive plan under the recognition provisions of fas 123 costs with respect to stock compensation are measured using the fair value of the shares subscribed or granted as at the date of grant recognized ratably over the vesting period such fair value is derived through an option pricing model statement of financial accounting standards no 148 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to fasb statement no 123 fas 148 was issued in 2002 this statement amended fas 123 and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the recognition provisions of fas 123 also fas 148 amended certain of the disclosure requirements of fas 123 aig has elected the prospective method in the application of the recognition provisions as prescribed by fas 123 such method provides for the recognition of the fair value with respect to stock based compensation for shares subscribed or granted on or after january 1 2003 prior to adoption of the recognition provisions of fas 123 as amended aig recognized stock compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees with respect to net income for the three month periods ended march 31 2003 and 2002 the following table provides a pro forma reconciliation as if aig had adopted the recognition provisions of fas 123 at its inception in millions except per share amounts data table removed actual stock based compensation earnings per share impact is substantially less than one cent controls and procedures
