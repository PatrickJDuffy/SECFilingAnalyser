non gaap measures throughout this md and a we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results some of the measurements we use are non gaap financial measures under securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the non gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude res funds withheld assets and book value per common share excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude res funds withheld assets and deferred tax assets dta adjusted book value per common share are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per common share basis after eliminating items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of aigs available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities in addition we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude res funds withheld assets since these fair value movements are economically transferred to fortitude re we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics book value per common share excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude res funds withheld assets is derived by dividing total aig common shareholders equity excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude res funds withheld assets by total common shares outstanding adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig common shareholders equity excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude res funds withheld assets and dta adjusted common shareholders equity by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a return on common equity adjusted after tax income excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude res funds withheld assets and dta adjusted return on common equity is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders equity we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities in addition we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude res funds withheld assets since these fair value movements are economically transferred to fortitude re we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on common equity adjusted return on common equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after tax income attributable to aig common shareholders by average adjusted common shareholders equity the reconciliation to return on common equity the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a 82 aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q item 2 use of non gaap measures adjusted after tax income attributable to aig common shareholders is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre tax income apti adjustments described below dividends on preferred stock and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance and net tax charge related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act and by excluding the net realized capital gains losses and other charges from noncontrolling interests we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the consolidated results of operations section of this md and a adjusted revenues exclude net realized capital gains losses income from non operating litigation settlements included in other income for gaap purposes and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits included in net investment income for gaap purposes adjusted revenues is a gaap measure for our operating segments adjusted pre tax income is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax this definition is consistent across our segments these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions and measures that we believe to be common to the industry apti is a gaap measure for our segments excluded items include the following data table removed aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q 83 item 2 use of non gaap measures general insurance ratios we along with most property and casualty insurance companies use the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses which for general insurance excludes net loss reserve discount and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on aig in excess of 10 million each and man made catastrophe losses such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the 10 million threshold we believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of managements control we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results life and retirement premiums and deposits includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies group benefit policies and life contingent payout annuities as well as deposits received on universal life investment type annuity contracts federal home loan bank fhlb funding agreements and mutual funds results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures 84 aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q item 2 critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment data table removed these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used our consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected the following accounting estimates have been updated from the descriptions in the 2019 annual report on account of the new accounting standard that changed how entities account for current expected credit losses cecl for most financial assets premiums receivable trade receivables off balance sheet exposures and reinsurance receivables the financial instruments credit losses standard that we adopted on january 1 2020 reinsurance recoverable the estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment particularly for latent exposures such as asbestos due to their long tail nature reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and consequently are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves similarly other assets include reinsurance recoverable for contracts which are accounted for as deposits aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q 85 item 2 critical accounting estimates we assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances at minimum on an annual basis through either historical trends of disputes and credit events or financial analysis of the credit quality of the reinsurer we record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for credit losses and disputes on uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance and other assets on the balance sheet collectively the reinsurance recoverable balances this estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include paid and unpaid amounts recoverable whether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection the relative financial health of the reinsurer as determined by the obligor risk ratings orrs we assign to each reinsurer based upon our financial reviews insurers that are financially troubled i e in run off have voluntarily or involuntarily been placed in receivership are insolvent are in the process of liquidation or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction are assigned orrs that will generate significant allowance and whether collateral and collateral arrangements exist an estimate of the reinsurance recoverables lifetime expected credit losses is established utilizing a probability of default and loss given default method which reflects the reinsurers orr rating the allowance for credit losses excludes disputed amounts an allowance for disputes is established for a reinsurance recoverable using the losses incurred model for contingencies at september 30 2020 the allowance for credit losses and disputes on reinsurance recoverable was 215 million or less than one percent of the consolidated reinsurance recoverable impairment charges impairments of investments available for sale securities if we intend to sell a fixed maturity security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security is below amortized cost an impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to realized capital losses no allowance is established in these situations when assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis management evaluates relevant facts and circumstances including but not limited to decisions to reposition our investment portfolio sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to take advantage of favorable pricing for fixed maturity securities for which a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost is due to credit related factors an allowance is established for the difference between the estimated recoverable value and amortized cost with a corresponding charge to realized capital losses the allowance for credit losses is limited to the difference between amortized cost and fair value the estimated recoverable value is the present value of cash flows expected to be collected as determined by management the difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not associated with credit related factors is presented in unrealized appreciation depreciation of fixed maturity securities on which an allowance for credit losses were recognized a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income commercial and residential mortgage loans at the time of origination or purchase an allowance for credit losses is established for mortgage and other loan receivables and is updated each reporting period changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded in realized capital losses this allowance reflects the risk of loss even when that risk is remote and reflects losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the loan the allowance for credit losses considers available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows including information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions we revert to historical information when we determine that we can no longer reliably forecast future economic assumptions the allowances for the commercial mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans are estimated utilizing a probability of default and loss given default model loss rate factors are determined based on historical data and adjusted for current and forecasted information the loss rates are applied based on individual loan attributes and considering such data points as loan to value ratios fair isaac corporation fico scores and debt service coverage the estimate of credit losses also reflects managements assumptions on certain macroeconomic factors that include but are not limited to gross domestic product growth employment inflation housing price index interest rates and credit spreads 86 aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q item 2 critical accounting estimates goodwill impairment goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized at both september 30 2020 and december 31 2019 our goodwill balance was 4 0 billion the operating segments with goodwill are our general insurance business north america and international operating segments our life and retirement business life insurance operating segment legacy portfolio and other operations goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred the date of our annual goodwill impairment testing is july 1 for this test in 2020 for substantially all of the reporting units we performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value to determine fair value we primarily use a discounted expected future cash flow analysis that estimates and discounts projected future distributable earnings such analysis is principally based on our business projections that inherently include judgments regarding business trends covid 19 has caused significant market volatility impacting our actual and projected results along with a decline in our stock price as this is an evolving crisis we expect to continue to monitor developments and perform updated analyses as necessary for a complete discussion of goodwill impairment see part i item 1a risk factors estimates and assumptions and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in the 2019 annual report and part ii item 1a risk factors in this quarterly report on form 10 q income taxes recoverability of net deferred tax asset the evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed we consider a number of factors to reliably estimate future taxable income so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses foreign tax credits realized capital loss and other carryforwards these factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and aig specific conditions and events we subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization we also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies we have also considered the impact of the tax act on our forecasts of taxable income made certain assumptions related to interpretation of relevant new rules and incorporated guidance issued by the u s tax authority our analysis also reflects the effect of slower utilization of our tax credits due to a reduction in the u s statutory tax rate as a result of the tax act recent events including the covid 19 crisis multiple reductions in target interest rates by the board of governors of the federal reserve system and significant market volatility continued to impact actual and projected results of our business operations as well as our views on potential effectiveness of certain prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in order to demonstrate the predictability and sufficiency of future taxable income necessary to support the realizability of the net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards we have considered forecasts of future income for each of our businesses including assumptions about future macro economic and aig specific conditions and events and any impact these conditions and events may have on our prudent and feasible tax planning strategies we also subjected the forecasts to a variety of stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization the carryforward periods of our foreign tax credit carryforwards range from tax years 2020 through 2023 carryforward periods for our net operating losses extend from 2028 forward however utilization of a portion of our net operating losses is limited under separate return limitation year rules based on the events that transpired in the nine month period ended september 30 2020 and our analysis of their potential impact on utilization of our tax attributes we concluded that valuation allowance should be established on a portion of our foreign tax credit carryforwards and net operating losses that are no longer more likely than not to be realized all of which was allocated to continuing operations aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q 87 item 2 critical accounting estimates for the nine month period ended september 30 2020 recent changes in market conditions including the covid 19 crisis and interest rate fluctuations impacted the unrealized tax gains and

resulted in an increase in credit spreads that partially offset the decrease in benchmark rates on the other hand if rates rise some of these impacts may abate while there may be different impacts some of which are highlighted below we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset liability management including spread management strategies for our investment oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities additionally sustained low interest rates may result in higher pension expense due to the impact on discounting of projected benefit cash flows annuity sales and surrenders the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on investment returns which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products however our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales but may also drive higher surrenders fixed annuities have surrender charge periods generally in the three to five year range which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment in addition older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio we closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period low interest rates have also reduced growth in our fixed index annuity products which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for annuities with guaranteed income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets including the level of interest rates credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment a low interest rate environment puts margin pressure on pricing of new business and on existing products due to the challenge of investing new money or recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low interest rate environment in addition there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in force business specifically the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset liability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability for additional information on our investment and asset liability management strategies see investments for investment oriented products in our individual retirement group retirement life insurance and institutional markets businesses our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads using asset liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees we will continue to adjust crediting rates on in force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment contractual minimum crediting rates and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre established intervals as and when interest rates begin to rise again we may need to raise crediting rates on in force business for competitive and other reasons potentially reducing the impact of investing in a higher interest rate environment of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products 67 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at september 30 2020 the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 60 percent and 61 percent at september 30 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to manage the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the context of regulatory requirements and competitive positioning in the core universal life business in

executive summary the following table presents fixed annuity and universal life account values of our individual retirement group retirement and life insurance operating segments by contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate and current crediting rates data table removed individual retirement and group retirement amounts shown include fixed options within variable annuity products general insurance the impact of low interest rates on our general insurance segment is primarily on our long tail casualty line of business we currently expect limited impacts on our existing long tail casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities sustained low interest rates would potentially impact new and renewal business for the long tail casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates however we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection in addition for our general insurance segment and general insurance run off lines reported within the legacy portfolio sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers compensation and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves standard of care developments in our life and retirement business we and our distributors are subject to laws and regulations regarding the standard of care

age for in service distributions from pension plans and certain section 457 plans to 59 some of the changes in law made by the secure act are complex and require further regulatory definition and

impact of covid 19 has and continues to adversely affect our clients particularly in certain industry segments where demand dropped significantly and is likely to remain challenging for a period of time even after the covid 19 crisis subsides the ultimate impact of covid 19 on our business will depend upon the speed at which government mandated safety precautions are lifted and the impact of any

due to lower gains on fair value option portfolios aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q 141 item 2 investments investments overview our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit by targeting an asset allocation mix that matches cash flows of our outstanding liabilities and provides diversification from an asset class sector issuer and geographic perspective the primary objectives are generation of investment income preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities the impact of covid 19 is evolving rapidly and will depend upon the scope severity and duration of the crisis as well as the actions taken by governments legislative bodies or regulators and other third parties in response all of which are continuing to evolve and are subject to continuing uncertainty adverse changes and developments affecting the global economy including a significant global economic slowdown and increased financial market volatility have had negative effects on our overall investment portfolio within our diversified investment portfolio there has been exposures to certain segments of the economy significantly affected by the crisis which has in certain periods resulted in the recognition of credit losses and increases in our allowance for credit losses further recognition of credit losses and increases in our allowances for credit losses could result if businesses remain closed or are closed again due to resurgences in infections and the impact of the crisis on the global economy worsens investment highlights in the nine months ended september 30 2020 a drop in interest rates was partially offset by a widening of credit spreads that resulted in a net unrealized gain movement in our investment portfolio net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 23 7 billion as of september 30 2020 from approximately 17 9 billion as of december 31 2019 we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities with favorable risk compared to return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income we experienced lower investment returns in our alternative investments and fair value option equity security holdings due to significant volatility in equity markets in the nine month period ended september 30 2020 and lower income from fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option was elected due to a widening of credit spreads in the current period this compares to the same period in the prior year where we experienced robust gains in our alternative investments which included income from an initial public offering of a holding in the private equity portfolio and higher gains in our fixed maturities securities portfolio for which we elected the fair value option due to a drop in rates and narrowing credit spreads blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called implemented cecl the new credit loss accounting standard in the first quarter of 2020 investment strategies investment strategies are assessed at the business segment level and involve considerations that include local and general market conditions duration and cash flow management risk appetite and volatility constraints rating agency and regulatory capital considerations and tax and legal investment limitations some of our key investment strategies are as follows our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments with similar characteristics to the associated insurance liabilities to the extent practicable aig embeds environmental social and governance esg considerations in its fundamental investment analysis of the companies or projects we invest in to ensure that they have sustainable earnings over the full term of our investment aig considers internal and external factors and evaluates changes in consumer behavior industry trends related to esg factors as well as the ability of the management of companies to respond appropriately to these changes in order to maintain their competitive advantage we seek to originate investments that offer enhanced yield through illiquidity premiums such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans which also add portfolio diversification these assets typically afford credit protections through covenants ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs and deeper due diligence given information access 142 aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q item 2 investments given our global presence we have access to assets that provide diversification from local markets to the extent we purchase these investments we generally hedge any currency risk using derivatives which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk adjusted returns compared to assets in the functional currency aig parent included in other operations actively manages its assets and liabilities counterparties and duration aig parents liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements this strategy allows us to both diversify our sources of liquidity and reduce the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity within the u s the life and retirement and general insurance investments are generally split between reserve backing and surplus portfolios insurance reserves are backed by mainly investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our duration risk return tax liquidity credit quality and diversification objectives we assess asset classes based on their fundamental underlying risk factors including credit public and private commercial real estate and residential real estate regardless of whether such investments are bonds loans or structured products surplus investments seek to enhance portfolio returns and are generally comprised of a mix of fixed maturity investment grade and below investment grade securities and various alternative asset classes including private equity real estate equity and hedge funds over the past few years hedge fund investments have been reduced with more emphasis given to private equity real estate and below investment grade credit outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by insurance companies consist primarily of investment grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate asset liability management the investment strategy within the general insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus maintenance of sufficient liquidity for unanticipated insurance claims and preservation of capital general insurance invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies north america operations have an average duration of 3 3 years fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies international operations have an average duration of 4 3 years while invested assets backing reserves of the general insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional liquid fixed maturity securities we have continued to allocate to asset classes that offer higher yields through structural and illiquidity premiums particularly in our north america operations in addition we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset backed investments to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates and inflation we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes sectors and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks in addition a portion of the surplus of general insurance is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments that seek to balance liquidity volatility and growth of surplus there is a higher allocation to equity oriented investments in general insurance surplus relative to other aig portfolios given the underlying inflation risks inherent in that business although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio the investment strategy of the life and retirement companies is to provide net investment income to back liabilities that result in stable distributable earnings and enhance portfolio value subject to asset liability management capital liquidity and regulatory constraints the life and retirement companies use asset liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses the life and retirement companies maintain a diversified high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans that to the extent practicable match the duration characteristics of the liabilities we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes sectors and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities and as a result duration varies between distinct portfolios the interest rate environment has a direct impact on the asset liability management profile of the businesses and an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio a further lengthening of the portfolio will be assessed in the context of available market opportunities as longer duration markets may not provide similar diversification benefits as shorter duration markets fixed maturity securities of the life and retirement companies domestic operations have an average duration of 8 6 years aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q 143 item 2 investments in addition the life and retirement companies seek to enhance surplus portfolio

costs update of actuarial assumptions the life insurance companies review and update actuarial assumptions at least annually generally in the third quarter assumption setting standards vary between investment oriented products and traditional long duration products investment oriented products the life insurance companies review and update estimated gross profit projections used to amortize dac and related items which may include voba sia and unearned revenue reserves as well as assessments used to accrue guaranteed benefit reserves for investment oriented products at least annually estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment related returns and spreads product related fees and expenses mortality gains and losses policyholder behavior and other factors in estimating future gross profits lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on dac amortization if the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly dac and related reserves are recalculated using the new projections and any resulting adjustment is included in income updating such projections may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products the life insurance companies also review assumptions related to their respective gmwb living benefits that are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value the fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions including policyholder behavior as well as capital market assumptions various assumptions were updated including the following effective september 30 2020 we decreased our reversion to the mean rates of return gross of fees to 3 12 percent from 3 62 percent for the variable annuity product line in individual retirement and to 2 87 percent from 3 29 percent for the variable annuity product line in group retirement primarily due to recent equity market movements our separate account long term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance remained unchanged at 7 0 percent and ultimate projected yields on the vast majority of our invested assets were lower on life and annuity deposits life deposit projected yields ranged from an increase of 9 basis points to a decrease of 14 basis points while annuity insurance deposits saw decreases of up to 24 basis points projected yields are graded from a weighted average net gaap book yield of existing assets supporting the business based on the value of the assets to a weighted average yield based on the duration of the assets excluding assets that mature during the grading period the grading period is three years for deferred annuity products and five years for life insurance products due to deferred annuities having a shorter duration than life products traditional long duration products for long duration traditional products discussed below which include whole life insurance term life insurance accident and health insurance long term care insurance and life contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements a lock in principle applies the assumptions used to calculate the

liabilities together with expected future premiums are not sufficient to provide for all future benefits expenses and dac amortization net of reinsurance a loss recognition event is driven by observed changes in actual experience or estimates differing significantly from locked in assumptions underlying assumptions including interest rates are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate for

retirement the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a favorable adjustment of 68 million primarily in the variable annuities line from extending the dac amortization projection period and partially offset by updates to expense and lapse assumptions extending the dac amortization projection period where analysis indicated material business remained after the prior period causes more modelled profits in the future which reduces the proportion of the total profit received to date and the amount of the dac that has been amortized to date for the period ended september 30

guaranteed benefits and hedging results our individual retirement and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with gmwb riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features the liabilities for gmwb are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates equity prices credit spreads market volatility policyholder behavior and other factors in addition to risk mitigating features in our variable annuity product design we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb including exposures to changes in interest rates equity prices credit spreads and volatility the hedging program utilizes derivative instruments including but not limited to equity options futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see part ii item 7 md and a enterprise risk management insurance risks life and retirement companies key risks variable annuity index annuity and universal life risk management and hedging programs in our 2019 annual report aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q 161 item 2 insurance reserves differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders the economic hedge target differs from the gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivatives primarily due to the following the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations the gaap valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for gaap valuation such as margins for policyholder behavior mortality and volatility and the economic hedge target excludes the non performance or own credit risk adjustment used in the gaap valuation which reflects a market participants view of our claims paying ability by incorporating a different spread the npa spread to the curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows because the discount rate includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margins the gaap valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors and to changes from actuarial assumption updates than the economic hedge target for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program the life and retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns which may be either positive or negative realized volatility versus implied volatility actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging particularly policyholder behavior and risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge the following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the gaap embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target data table removed impact on pre tax income loss the impact on our pre tax income loss of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments both

hedging program are excluded from adjusted pre tax income of individual retirement and group retirement 162 aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q item 2 insurance reserves the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target the gaap embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio as discussed above when corporate credit spreads widen the change in the npa spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a gain and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a loss in addition to changes driven by credit market related movements in the npa spread the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits the following table presents the net increase decrease to consolidated pre tax income loss from changes in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives and related hedges excluding related dac amortization data table removed beginning in july 2019 the fixed maturity securities portfolio used in the hedging program was rebalanced to

comprehensive income was 10 million and 139 million for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2020 respectively the net negative impact on pre tax income loss of 135 million from the gmwb embedded derivatives and related hedges in the three month period ended september 30 2020 excluding related dac amortization was driven by tightening of credit spreads on the economic hedge target and npa spread and npa volume losses from lower expected gmwb payments partially offset by gains from the review and update of actuarial assumptions net of the hedging portfolio the net positive impact on pre tax income loss of 1 1 billion from the gmwb embedded derivatives and related hedges in the nine month period ended september 30 2020 excluding related dac amortization was driven by the widening of credits spreads on the economic hedge target and the npa and impact of lower interest rates that resulted in npa volume gains from higher expected gmwb payments partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives excluding npa net of the hedging portfolio the net impact on pre tax income in the three and nine

losses from decreases in interest rates offset by gains from higher equity markets and widening credit spreads fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a gaap basis due to the npa and other risk margins used for gaap valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio on an economic basis the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the increase in the economic hedge target as discussed below in the three month period ended september 30 2020 we estimated a net mark to market loss of approximately 270 million from our hedging activities related to our economic hedge target primarily driven by tightening credit spreads partially offset by gains from the review and update of actuarial assumptions in the nine month period ended september 30 2020 we estimated a net mark to market gain of approximately 897 million from our hedging activities related to our economic hedge target primarily driven by widening credit spreads and gains from the review and update of actuarial assumptions in the three and

swaptions and futures resulted in losses driven by higher interest rates in the three month period ended september 30 2020 and resulted in gains driven by lower interest rates in the three month period ended september 30 2019 and the nine month periods ended september 30 2020 and 2019 changes in the fair value of equity derivative contracts which included futures and options which resulted in

matters in october 2020 the southern district of new york dismissed the case related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions based upon the settlement reached between aig and the government the settlement agreements in principle were also concluded in our ongoing dispute related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions and we will be required to make a payment to the u s treasury the amount we currently expect to pay based on settlement terms is approximately 1 2 billion including obligations of aig parent and subsidiaries this amount is net of payments previously made with respect to cross border financing transactions involving matters dating back to 1997 and other matters largely related to the same tax years including a prepayment of approximately 548 million that aig made to the u s treasury in june 2020 the amount also includes interest that will become due on finalization of the settlements but does not reflect benefits from the potential application of interest netting which aig has requested there remains uncertainty with regard to the amount and timing of any additional payments which could be made as early as the fourth quarter of 2020 aig has waived assessment on certain amounts and the irs will seek payment through a notice and demand for payment once all relevant computations including those related to interest netting are completed for additional information regarding this matter see note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements credit facilities we maintain a committed revolving syndicated credit facility the facility as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes the facility provides for aggregate

the facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal operating administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facility these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the facility

these assumptions include mortality morbidity future lapse rates expenses investment returns and interest crediting rates offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in force policies due to the significance of the assumptions the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments the amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the consolidated balance sheets we believe that our life and retirement companies have adequate financial resources to meet the payments actually required under these obligations these subsidiaries have substantial liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments in addition our life and retirement companies maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating

annual report on how difficult conditions in the financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of our operations regulatory environment overview our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities including insurance securities derivatives investment advisory and thrift regulators in the united states and abroad the insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business we expect that the domestic and international regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future 180 aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q item 2 regulatory environment in particular significant legislative and regulatory activity has occurred at both the u s federal and state levels as well as globally in response to covid 19 and its impact on insurance consumers for example many jurisdictions have issued regulations and guidance advising or requiring insurers to offer accommodations to policyholders adversely impacted by covid 19 including requirements to defer payment of or refund premiums postpone policy lapses and have sought information and data from insurers on a number of topics including operational preparedness policyholder data claims data and other matters a number of u s states have also passed legislation or issued other guidance that creates a presumption of coverage under workers compensation insurance for certain people impacted by covid 19 in most cases the presumption applies to first responders and medical professionals but some states apply the scope of the presumption more broadly and efforts are underway in other states to further expand the scope of the presumption members of the u s congress have held discussions and sought information with respect to business interruption travel and other insurance lines impacted by the covid 19 crisis and legislators both in the u s and overseas are discussing a number of potential loss sharing programs some of which contemplate participation by insurers including a proposed pandemic risk insurance bill relating to business interruption and event cancellation insurance in the eu and uk insurance regulators have issued recommendations or requirements for insurance groups subject to their jurisdiction to temporarily suspend discretionary dividend payments and share buybacks for the benefit of shareholders and variable remuneration policies such as cash bonuses we cannot predict what form legal and regulatory responses to concerns about covid 19 and related public health issues will take or how such responses will impact our business we continue to actively monitor these developments and to cooperate fully with all government and regulatory authorities as they develop their responses in addition to the information set forth in this quarterly report on form 10 q our regulatory status is also discussed in part ii item 1a risk factors covid 19 is adversely affecting and is expected to continue to adversely affect our global business financial condition and results of operations and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope severity and duration of the crisis and the governmental legislative and regulatory actions taken and court decisions rendered in response thereto erisa we provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa and or the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the internal revenue code plans subject to erisa include certain pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans including health life and disability plans as a result our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by erisa and the internal revenue code including the requirement under erisa that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of erisa plan participants and beneficiaries and that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions the applicable provisions of erisa and the internal revenue code are subject to enforcement by the department of labor dol the internal revenue service and the pension benefit guaranty corporation standard of care developments in our life and retirement business we and our distributors are subject to laws and regulations regarding the standard of care applicable to sales of our products and the provision of advice to our customers in recent years many of these laws and regulations have been revised or reexamined while others have been newly adopted we continue to closely follow these legislative and regulatory activities changes in standard of care requirements or new standards issued by governmental authorities such as the dol the sec the naic or state regulators and or legislators may affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition dol fiduciary rule in june 2020 the dol issued final guidance consistent with the june 2018 decision of the fifth circuit court of appeals which vacated the dols fiduciary rule that redefined who would be considered a fiduciary for purposes of transactions with erisa qualified plans related plan participants and individual retirement accounts the dols final guidance formally reinstated the previous five part test for determining who is an investment advice fiduciary and also reinstated related exemptions which had been modified by the vacated guidance at the same time the dol proposed a new prohibited transaction exemption for parties that qualify as investment advice fiduciaries which is intended to align with the secs best interest regulation see below as well as other relevant standards of care requirements the dols proposed exemption would impose impartial conduct standards including a best interest standard as well as disclosure obligations a duty to establish maintain and follow policies and procedures intended to comply with the exemption and a duty to perform an annual retrospective review for compliance with the exemption aig third quarter 2020 form 10 q 181 item 2 regulatory environment we are currently reviewing the dols guidance both for applicability and for the impact the exemption requirements if applicable may have on our businesses and operations at this time we believe that many of the processes and procedures we implemented for the secs best interest regulation will satisfy some or all of the corresponding provisions in the dol guidance but implementation may still result in increased compliance costs for certain of our life and retirement businesses sec best interest regulation on june 30 2020 regulation best interest regulation bi which establishes new rules regarding the standard of care a broker must meet when making a recommendation to a retail customer in connection with the sale of a security or other covered recommendation and form crs which requires enhanced disclosure by broker dealers and investment advisers regarding client relationships and certain conflicts of interest issues became effective both had been adopted by the sec in june 2019 as part of a package of final rulemakings and interpretations at the same time as the sec issued two interpretations under the investment advisers act of 1940 the first interpretation addressed the standard of conduct applicable to sec registered investment advisers including details regarding the fiduciary duty owed to clients required disclosures and the advisers continuous monitoring obligations the second interpretation clarified when investment advice would be considered solely incidental to brokerage activity for purposes of the broker dealer exclusion from sec investment adviser registration these two sec interpretations became final upon publication the sec has also issued multiple sets of faqs on certain aspects of regulation bi and form crs and the sec could provide additional guidance regarding these final rules and further clarify its interpretations through the issuance of additional faqs and other publications we have evaluated the impact of the package of final rulemakings and interpretations on us and our customers distribution partners and financial advisers and have implemented and enhanced processes and procedures where needed to comply with the final rules and interpretations these efforts and enhancements have resulted in increased compliance costs for group retirement state developments in february 2020 the naic adopted revisions to its suitability in annuity transactions model regulation 275 naic model implementing a best interest standard of care applicable to sales and recommendations of annuities the new naic model conforms in large part to regulation bi providing that all recommendations by agents and insurers must be in the best interest of the consumer under known circumstances at the time an annuity recommendation is made without placing their financial interests ahead of the consumers interest in making a recommendation specifically the model requires agents and carriers to act with reasonable diligence care and skill in making recommendations the revisions also include enhancements to the current models supervision system to assist in compliance certain states have already adopted amendments to their suitability rules based on the naic model revisions and we expect that additional states will do so in addition certain state insurance and or securities regulators and legislatures have adopted or are considering adoption of their own best interest or fiduciary standards some of which are broader in scope than the naic model for example in july 2018 the new york state department of financial services adopted a best interest standard of care regulation applicable to annuity and life transactions through
