guidance under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank regarding the designation of non bank systemically important financial institutions sifis on april 3 2012 the fsoc formally adopted the rule in substantially the same form as proposed the rule sets forth a three stage determination process for designating non bank sifis in stage 1 fsoc would apply a set of uniform quantitative thresholds to identify the nonbank financial companies that will be subject to further evaluation aig expects that the fsoc will make its stage 1 identifications before the end of 2012 based on its financial condition as of june 30 2012 aig would meet the criteria in stage 1 and would be subject to further evaluation by the fsoc in the sifi determination process because stages 2 and 3 would involve qualitative judgment by the fsoc aig cannot predict whether it would be designated as a non bank sifi under the rule the sec and the cftc have adopted final rules defining major swap participant for purposes of title vii of dodd frank the definitions contain quantitative tests to be applied on a quarterly basis based on these quantitative tests and the existing size of aigfp swap portfolio it appears that both aigfp and aig parent as a guarantor of aigfp swaps may need to register as major swap participants however interpretational issues remain with respect to the final rules including the treatment of stable value contracts and the extra territorial scope of the rules and the precise time when the quantitative tests must be applied is uncertain accordingly depending on the exact timing of the testing and the size of aigfp swap portfolio at that time aigfp and aig parent may not meet the quantitative tests for registration if aigfp and aig parent are required to register as major swap dealers they will become subject to derivative transaction clearing execution and reporting requirements capital and margin requirements and business conduct rules aig insurance companies like other insurers are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business state regulation relates primarily to financial condition as well as corporate conduct and market conduct activities in particular states have also become increasingly aggressive in using escheatment laws to seek recovery of unclaimed life insurance benefits there are a number of proposals to amend state insurance laws and regulations and a review of insurance solvency regulation throughout the u s regulatory system which could significantly affect aig insurance businesses at the federal level dodd frank will subject aig insurance subsidiaries investment advisors broker dealers and their affiliates to additional federal regulation in addition regulators and lawmakers around the world are developing recommendations to address issues such as financial group supervision corporate governance enterprise risk management capital and solvency standards and related issues which could potentially affect aig and its subsidiaries in march 2011 federal regulators as required by dodd frank issued a proposed risk retention rule that included a definition of a qualified residential mortgage qrm in respect of which issuers of asset backed securities would not be subject to certain risk retention requirements the qrm definition included among other standards a maximum loan to value ratio ltv of 80 percent for a home purchase transaction the ltv is calculated without imputing any benefit from private mortgage insurance coverage that may be purchased for that loan the final regulations could adversely impact ugc volume of domestic first lien new insurance written depending on the final definition of a qrm the maximum ltv allowed and the benefit if any

increases in reserves if changes in estimates of future investment returns result in projected future losses sunamerica would not expect a dac unlocking or an increase in reserves due to loss recognition in 2012 solely as a result of the low interest rate environment however because of the long term nature of certain contracts for which reserving assumptions are established upon issuance of the contracts small changes in certain of the original assumptions particularly estimates of future invested asset returns may cause large changes in the amount of reserve adequacy in conjunction with the development of prudent and feasible programs that resulted in the utilization of capital loss carryforwards in the first six months of 2012 sunamerica sold approximately 8 9 billion of investments these sales resulted in capital gains which enhanced statutory capital and effectively transferred 548 million of shadow loss recognition to actual loss recognition additional sales of

implement a more efficient legal entity structure while continuing to market products and services under currently existing brands at the conclusion of this legal entity consolidation initiative sunamerica expects to reduce the number of its operating life insurance legal entities to three subject to receiving all necessary regulatory approvals these legal entity mergers are targeted to be effective as of december 31 2012 variable annuities sunamerica variable annuity sales increased due to access to broad distribution including several new distributors and reinstatement in sunamerica

to manage economic risk exposure associated with changes in the fair value of embedded derivative liabilities contained in certain variable annuity contracts caused by changes in the equity markets interest rates and market implied volatilities sunamerica substantially hedges its exposure to equity markets however due to regulatory capital considerations a significant portion of sunamerica

delivery model and a more efficient operating platform over time interest crediting rates the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in sunamerica products may have the effect in a continued low interest rate environment of reducing sunamerica spreads and thus reducing future profitability sunamerica partially mitigates this interest rate risk through its asset liability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a prolonged low interest rate environment may nevertheless negatively affect spreads on interest sensitive business as of june 30 2012 the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities consisted of intermediate and long term fixed maturity securities sunamerica generally purchases assets with the intent of matching expected maturities of the insurance liabilities an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of maturities from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses opportunistic investments in structured securities continue to be made in order to improve yields increase net investment income and help to offset the impact of the lower interest rate environment sunamerica annuity and universal life products were designed with contractual provisions that allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees therefore on new business currently written as well as on in force business above minimum guarantees sunamerica has adjusted and will continue to adjust crediting rates in order to maintain targeted interest rate spreads new fixed annuity sales have declined in the first six months of 2012 relative to the same period in 2011 as consumers appeared reluctant to purchase such annuities at the relatively lower crediting rates offered however even in the current interest rate environment sunamerica continues to pursue new sales at targeted interest rate spreads these annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of 1 percent universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non indexed products and 1 percent on new indexed products and are designed to be sufficient to meet targeted interest spreads as a result of these actions sunamerica estimates that if interest rates remain at or near current levels

leader in the mortgage insurance industry with a differentiated risk based pricing model producing new high quality business the withdrawal of certain competitors from the market during 2011 combined with the differentiation strategy that ugc implemented in late 2010 and early 2011 has positioned ugc to take advantage of market opportunities ugc is continuing to execute this strategy during 2012 in the first six months of 2012 ugc increased pricing nationally by approximately 3 5 percent and will continue to review its new business pricing relative to changes in the market to ensure that the price of coverage is commensurate with the level of risk being underwritten delinquent inventory review beginning in the third quarter of 2011 and continuing into the second quarter of 2012 ugc requested that lenders file claims in accordance with the terms of the respective master policies on approximately 20 000 accounts that had been delinquent approximately 24 months or more and were not expected to be cured many of these delinquencies were the result of the foreclosure moratorium discussed below through june 30 2012 ugc received responses to approximately 88 percent of these requests the claims arising from these requests have resulted in coverage rescissions and claim denials at levels higher than previously experienced ugc has considered these higher levels of rescissions and denials and the potential for higher levels of overturns in estimating its reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses over the remainder of 2012 reserve development and premium refunds associated with these claim requests will continue to impact the business especially in the third quarter of 2012 when ugc expects overturn activity related to these delinquencies to be at its highest ugc continues to monitor and review the status of these requests and plans to contact lenders on an ongoing basis regarding additional delinquencies that meet these criteria under the terms of these master policies if a claim is not submitted within a year of ugc request the lender would no longer be able to file a claim foreclosure delays since 2010 a variety of servicing practices have come to light that have delayed the foreclosure process in many states some of these practices such as the robo signing of affidavits in judicial foreclosures have resulted in government investigations into lenders foreclosure practices these developments have slowed the reporting of foreclosures which has in turn slowed the filing of mortgage insurance claims and increased the uncertainty surrounding the determination of the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses ugc assumptions regarding future foreclosures on current delinquencies take into consideration this trend although significant uncertainty remains surrounding the determination of the liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses ugc expects that this trend may continue for the remainder of 2012 and may negatively affect ugc future financial results final resolution of these issues is uncertain and ugc cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact that any resolution individually or collectively may have on its future results of operations or financial condition as discussed above ugc has requested that lenders file claims on delinquent loans before foreclosure proceedings have commenced in an effort to reduce the uncertainty surrounding these issues ugc expects to continue this practice as long as significant delays in reporting foreclosures continue global capital markets

consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period in determining the loss development from prior accident years aig conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence aig conducted reserve analyses in 2012 to determine the loss development from prior

exposures 1986 and prior and excess casualty lines this was partially offset by net favorable development in reserves for natural catastrophes principally the tohoku catastrophe and favorable development in the consumer insurance operating segment which is included in all other net the development in the chartis environmental business was primarily attributable to claims increases in four

industrial processes present a significant environmental exposure policies that provide an enhanced general liability product designed specifically to meet the needs of environmental consultants and contractors and a surety policy that provided performance bonding for the remediation and closure of a landfill site the claims increase in the chartis environmental line was the result of an on going review of certain cases that aig believes to be subject to the most volatility for several of those cases aig concluded that the reserves should be increased to take into account the updated

derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would take before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aig determination of its reserves is not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analyses thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio the following table presents survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined which were based upon a three

for those securities for most security types supported by real estate related assets current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities this is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for securities whose performance is closely linked to the commercial and residential real estate sectors in addition for floating rate securities persistently low libor levels continue to make these securities less attractive aig believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral based securities low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts based on its analysis and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities aig continues to believe that the expected cash flows from these

in the 2011 annual report critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment aig considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of estimates with respect to income taxes including recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax planning strategies and operating profitability of the character necessary for their realization recoverability of assets including deferred policy acquisition costs flight equipment and reinsurance

investment oriented products impairment charges including other than temporary impairments on financial instruments and goodwill impairments liabilities for legal contingencies and fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities including cds these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used aig financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected the following is a discussion of updates to critical accounting estimates during 2012 for a complete discussion of aig critical accounting estimates see the 2011 annual report recoverability of deferred tax asset aig considers the recoverability of its deferred tax asset to be a critical accounting estimate the evaluation of the recoverability of aig deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires aig to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion about aig framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets

short duration insurance contracts dac is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts for short duration insurance contracts starting on january 1 2012 aig has elected to include anticipated investment income in its determination of whether the deferred policy acquisition costs are recoverable aig believes the inclusion of anticipated investment income in the recoverability analysis is a preferable accounting policy as it includes in the recoverability analysis the fact that there is a timing difference between when the premiums are collected and in turn invested and when the losses and related expenses are paid this is considered a change in accounting principle that requires retrospective application to all periods presented because aig historically has not recorded any premium deficiency on its short duration insurance contracts even without the inclusion of anticipated investment income there were no changes to the historical financial statements for the change in accounting principle aig assesses the recoverability of its dac on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred this assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income on inforce business to the sum of expected claims claims adjustment expenses anticipated policy maintenance costs and unamortized dac if the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premium and anticipated investment income the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for dac this offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge management tested the recoverability of dac and determined that recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income for chartis exceeded the sum of these costs at june 30 2012 on january 1 2012 aig adopted an accounting standard that amends the accounting for costs incurred by insurance companies that can be capitalized in connection with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts the adoption of this

superseded basel ii but the details of its implementation by the various european central banking districts have not been finalized should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame in light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data to the extent deemed relevant and available aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2012 other than for transactions where global capital markets believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief although aig believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the

inputs on aig calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average prices for cdos increased during 2012 further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the binomial expansion technique bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the total 4 6 billion net notional amount of cds written on multi sector cdos outstanding at june 30 2012 a bet value is available for 2 9 billion net notional amount no bet value is determined for 1 7 billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 2 9 billion the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities while the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a cdo the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile especially given current market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo at this time the following table presents key inputs used in the bet model and the potential increase decrease to the fair value of the

changes in any other assumption no assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed perhaps significantly the ranges assumed by aig for purposes of the above analysis no
