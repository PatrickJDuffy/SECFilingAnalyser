aig and airco entered into the aia purchase agreement with the frbny pursuant to which the frbny will purchase preferred equity interests in a newly formed special purpose vehicle in exchange for a reduction of 16 billion in the outstanding balance of the frbny facility and the maximum amount available to be borrowed thereunder provided the maximum amount available under the frbny facility will

purchase preferred equity interests in a newly formed special purpose vehicle in exchange for a reduction of 9 billion in the outstanding balance of the frbny facility and the maximum amount available to be borrowed thereunder provided the maximum amount available under the frbny facility will not be less than 25 billion as a result of such reduction amortization of prepaid commitment asset any permanent reduction in the frbny facility will result in accelerated amortization of a portion of the prepaid commitment asset therefore aig anticipates that the consummation of each of the aia purchase agreement and the alico purchase agreement will result in accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment asset at the time that the senior interests are transferred to the frbny currently expected to occur no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2009 acceleration of the amortization will result in a pre tax charge to earnings which could aggregate to approximately 5 0 billion 92 american international group inc and subsidiaries life insurance securitizations on march 2 2009 aig and the board of governors of the federal reserve system announced their intent to enter into transactions pursuant to which the frbny will purchase embedded value securitization notes issued by newly formed spvs to be repaid with the net cash flows from designated blocks of existing life insurance policies the proceeds of the notes would be applied in settlement of a portion of the outstanding balance of the frbny facility and would reduce the maximum amount to be borrowed thereunder provided the maximum amount available under the frbny facility will not be less than 25 billion as a result of such reduction the amount of the frbny facility reduction will be based on the proceeds received and will also result in accelerated amortization of a portion of the prepaid commitment asset the spvs are expected to be consolidated by aig see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these transactions aigs strategy for stabilization and repayment of its obligations as they come due future cash requirements the following table shows the maturing debt of aig and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters data table removed data table removed in addition at july 29 2009 aig affiliates had 10 7 billion of commercial paper outstanding under the cpff all of which matures in october 2009 this includes 3 4 billion issued by aig funding inc aig funding if aigs short term ratings are downgraded aig may lose access to the cpff and would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper aig expects to meet these obligations primarily through borrowings from the frbny facility and the cash flows from and the disposition of assets supporting these obligations additional liquidity is also available under the department of treasury commitment debt maturities for the matched investment program mip are expected to be funded through cash flows generated from invested assets principal and interest as well as the sale or financing of the asset portfolios in the program approximately 3 3 billion of aigfps debt maturities through june 30 2010 are fully collateralized with assets backing the corresponding liabilities it is expected that agf and ilfc will require support from aig in addition to their cash flows from operations and proceeds from potential asset sales and securitizations to meet their existing obligations aig intends to provide such support through august 15 2010 to the extent that asset sales securitizations and or other transactions are not sufficient in the first six months of 2009 aig made capital contributions of 2 4 billion to certain of its domestic life insurance and retirement services companies approximately 1 2 billion of this amount was funded through drawdowns under the department of the treasury commitment if a substantial portion of the domestic life insurance and retirement services bond portfolio diminishes significantly in value or suffers adverse credit events aig may need to provide additional capital support for these operations 93 american international group inc and subsidiaries aig made capital contributions of 641 million to its commercial insurance companies in the first six months of 2009 all of which was returned as a dividend to aig in july 2009 in addition in connection with the sale by a commercial insurance subsidiary of a portion of its common stock of transatlantic holdings inc transatlantic aig made a capital contribution of 91 million in the second quarter of 2009 to that company aig also made a 600 million capital contribution to agf through aig capital corporation during the first six months of 2009 and agf loaned 800 million to aig parent under a demand note aig has developed certain plans described below some of which have already been implemented to provide stability to its businesses and to provide for the timely repayment of the frbny facility other plans are still being formulated asset disposition plan aig has revised its asset disposition plans over the last nine months to take into account the deterioration of global market conditions aigs current asset disposition plan is to maximize the value of its businesses over a longer time frame aig continually reassesses its disposition plans and may revise its disposition plans at any time and from time to time sales of businesses and specific asset dispositions sales of businesses dispositions of certain businesses will be subject to regulatory approval proceeds from these dispositions to the extent they do not represent capital of aigs insurance subsidiaries required for regulatory or ratings purposes are contractually required to be applied toward the repayment of the frbny facility as mandatory prepayments during the first six months of 2009 and through july 31 2009 aig entered into agreements to sell or completed the sale of operations and assets excluding aigfp assets that had aggregate assets and liabilities with carrying values of 31 2 billion and 23 8 billion respectively at june 30 2009 or the date of sale or in the case of transatlantic deconsolidation aggregate net proceeds from these sale transactions are expected to be approximately 8 0 billion these transactions are expected to generate approximately 4 6 billion of aggregate net cash proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings on and reduce the amount of the frbny facility after taking into account taxes transaction expenses and capital required to be retained for regulatory or ratings purposes gains and losses recorded in connection with the disposals of businesses include estimates that are subject to subsequent adjustment based on the transactions thus far aig does not believe that such adjustments will be material to future results of operations or cash flows these transactions included the following on june 10 2009 aig closed a public offering of 29 9 million shares of transatlantic common stock owned by aig for aggregate proceeds of 1 1 billion at the close of the public offering aig retained 13 9 percent of transatlantics outstanding shares of common stock as a result aig deconsolidated transatlantic which resulted in a 1 4 billion reduction in noncontrolling interest a component of total equity on july 1 2009 aig closed the sale of its u s auto insurance business 21st century insurance group this operation had total assets and liabilities with carrying values of 5 7 billion and 3 4 billion respectively at june 30 2009 aggregate proceeds from the sale of this business including proceeds applied to repay intercompany loan facilities were 1 9 billion on may 28 2009 aig completed the sale of its headquarters building in tokyo for approximately 1 2 billion in cash due to aigs continued involvement as a lessee primarily in the form of a lease deposit through 2011 the sale is accounted for as a financing arrangement with any gain deferred until the expiration of aigs leases in early 2011 on july 28 2009 aig completed the sale of a majority of the u s life insurance premium finance business of aig credit corp and a i credit consumer discount company a i credit with a carrying value of 941 3 million at that date for 680 million in cash including 230 million held in escrow 94 american international group inc and subsidiaries securitization transaction during the first six months of 2009 agf received proceeds of 1 4 billion from real estate loan portfolio sales in addition on july 30 2009 agf issued mortgage backed certificates in a private securitization transaction of certain agf real estate loans and received initial cash proceeds of 967 million aigfp wind down aigfp is engaged in a multi step process of unwinding its businesses and portfolios in connection with that process certain assets have been sold or are under contract to be sold the proceeds from these sales will be used to fund aigfps wind down and are not included in the amounts above the frbny has waived the requirement under the frbny credit agreement that the proceeds of these specific pending sales be applied as a mandatory prepayment under the frbny facility which would result in a permanent reduction of the frbnys commitment to lend to aig instead the frbny has given aigfp permission to retain the proceeds of these completed sales and has required that such proceeds received from certain future sales be used to voluntarily prepay the frbny facility with the amounts prepaid available for future reborrowing subject to the terms of the frbny facility with the consent of the frbny aigfp is also opportunistically terminating contracts aigfp is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio reduce risk and hedge the currency interest rate and other market risks associated with aigs affiliated businesses due to the long term duration of aigfps derivative contracts and the complexity of aigfps portfolio aig expects that an orderly wind down of aigfp will take a substantial period of time the cost of executing the wind down will depend on many factors many of which are not within aigs control including market conditions aigfps access to markets via market counterparties the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades aig continually evaluates overall market conditions performance of businesses that are for sale and market and business performance of competitors and likely bidders for these assets this evaluation informs decision making about the timing and process of putting businesses up for sale depending on market and business conditions as noted above aig can modify its sales approach to maximize value for aig and the u s taxpayers in the disposition process such a modification could result in the sale of additional or other assets liquidity of parent and subsidiaries aig parent aig parent had the following sources of liquidity data table removed as a result aig believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the parent to meet its obligations through at least the next twelve months however no assurance can be given that aigs cash needs will not exceed projected amounts additional collateral calls at aigfp a further downgrade of aigs credit ratings or unexpected capital or liquidity needs of aigs subsidiaries may result in significant additional cash needs for a further discussion of this risk see item 1a risk factors in the 2008 form 10 k since the fourth quarter of 2008 aig has not had access to its traditional sources of long term or short term financing through the public debt markets further in light of the performance of aigs common stock aig does not expect to be able to issue equity securities for cash in the public markets in the foreseeable future 95 american international group inc and subsidiaries historically aig depended on dividends distributions and other payments from subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations in light of aigs current financial situation many of its regulated subsidiaries are restricted from making dividend payments or advancing funds to aig see item 1a risk factors in the 2008 form 10 k as a result aig has been dependent on the frbny facility the cpff and other transactions with the frbny and the department of the treasury as its primary sources of liquidity primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and subsidiary funding in the six month period ended june 30 2009 aig parent collected 608 million in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries primarily from insurance company subsidiaries and retired 381 million of debt excluding mip and series aigfp debt excluding mip and series aigfp debt aig parent made interest payments totaling 1 0 billion and made 2 3 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in the six months ended june 30 2009 in addition during the six months ended june 30 2009 aig parent made loans totaling 1 2 billion to wholly owned subsidiaries which in turn principally were used to make capital contributions to insurance companies aig parent traditionally funded a portion of its short term working capital needs through commercial paper issued by aig funding since october 2008 all commercial paper issuance for aig funding has been through the cpff program aig funding was accepted into the cpff with a total borrowing limit of 6 9 billion and had approximately 4 9 billion and 3 4 billion outstanding at june 30 2009 and july 29 2009 respectively all commercial paper outstanding for aig funding as of these dates was issued under the cpff as of june 30 2009 and july 29 2009 aig fundings commercial paper program had average maturities of 25 days and 86 days respectively the board of governors of the federal reserve system has extended the cpff program until february 1 2010 with the maximum final maturity of 90 days from that date if aigs short term ratings are downgraded aig may lose access to the cpff and would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper aig expects to use a portion of the proceeds from the repayment of intercompany debt received in connection with the sales of assets to fund maturing commercial paper aigs liquidity could also be further impaired by unforeseen significant outflows of cash this situation may arise due to circumstances that aig may be unable to control such as a further reduction in asset values a ratings downgrade a worsening of the current recession or the requirements of subsidiaries to replace capital as a consequence of catastrophe claims regulatory and other legal restrictions would likely limit aigs ability to transfer funds freely either to or from its subsidiaries general insurance during the six months ended june 30 2009 aig made a capital contribution of 641 million to a commercial insurance subsidiary all of which was returned as a dividend to aig in july 2009 in addition in connection with the sale by a commercial insurance subsidiary of a portion of its common shares of transatlantic aig made a capital contribution of 91 million in the second quarter of 2009 to that company aig currently expects that its general insurance subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due through cash from operations and to the extent necessary asset dispositions one or more large catastrophes however may require aig to provide additional support to the affected general insurance operations in addition further downgrades in aigs credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of these subsidiaries a downgrade in the insurer financial strength ratings of an insurance company subsidiary could result in non renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect these companies ability to meet their own obligations and require that aig provide capital or liquidity support to them for a discussion of aigs potential inability to support its subsidiaries see item 1a risk factors liquidity in the 2008 form 10 k at june 30 2009 general insurance had liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments of 12 4 billion these are consolidated cash and short term investments for a number of legal entities within general insurance generally these assets are not transferable across various legal entities however there are generally sufficient cash and short term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs in the event additional liquidity is required management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities government and corporate bonds represented 95 8 percent of general insurance total fixed income 96 american international group inc and subsidiaries investments at june 30 2009 given the size and liquidity profile of aigs general insurance investment portfolios aig believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk aigs asset liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and the specific nature and risk profile of liabilities historically there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of aigs general insurance investments and the payment of claims life insurance and retirement services at june 30 2009 life insurance and retirement services had liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments of 39 8 billion these are consolidated cash and short term investments for a number of legal entities within life insurance and retirement services generally these assets are not transferable across various legal entities however there are generally sufficient cash and short term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs in the event additional liquidity is required management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities government and corporate bonds represented 86 2 percent of life insurance and retirement services total fixed income investments at june 30 2009 given the size and liquidity profile of aigs life insurance and retirement services investment portfolios aig believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk the life insurance and retirement services subsidiaries have been able to meet liquidity needs even during the period of higher surrenders which was experienced from mid september 2008 through june 30 2009 and expect to be able to do so in the foreseeable future a significant increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals which could be triggered by a variety of factors including aig specific concerns could result in a substantial liquidity strain other potential events causing a liquidity strain could include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to life insurance and retirement services operations nationalization catastrophic terrorist acts pandemics or other economic or political upheaval foreign life insurance companies aigs foreign life insurance companies including alico had significant capital needs following publicity of aig parents liquidity issues related credit ratings downgrades and the decline in the equity markets in 2008 during the six months ended june 30 2009 aig provided funding of 300 million to a subsidiary within the foreign life insurance companies aig believes that its foreign life insurance subsidiaries have adequate capital to support their business plans through 2009 however to the extent the investment portfolios of the foreign life insurance companies continue to be adversely affected by market conditions aig may need to lend or contribute additional capital to these companies for a discussion of aigs potential inability to support its subsidiaries see item 1a risk factors liquidity in the 2008 form 10 k domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies during the six months ended june 30 2009 aig contributed capital totaling 2 4 billion to certain of its domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services subsidiaries of which 165 million was retained in the domestic life insurance holding company and not contributed to the operating companies to replace a portion of the capital lost as a result of net realized capital losses primarily resulting from other than temporary impairment charges and other investment related items of this amount 1 2 billion was funded by a drawdown under the department of the treasury commitment in may 2009 further capital contributions may be required to maintain desired levels of capital to the extent the investment portfolios of the domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies continue to be adversely affected by market conditions the most significant potential liquidity needs of aigs domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies are the funding of surrenders and the restoration of capital eroded by investment related losses a substantial increase in these needs could place stress on the liquidity of these companies however aig currently has sufficient short term liquidity to meet such demands for a discussion of aigs potential inability to support its subsidiaries see item 1a risk factors liquidity in the 2008 form 10 k 97 american international group inc and subsidiaries financial services aigs major financial services operating subsidiaries consist of ilfc aigfp agf and aig consumer finance group inc aigcfg traditional sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of these operations are generally no longer available these sources included issuances of guaranteed investment agreements gias issuance of long and short term debt issuance of commercial paper bank loans and bank credit facilities however ilfc has been able to finance airbus aircraft purchases under its 2004 export credit agency eca facility as further described below and aigcfg has been able to retain a significant portion of customer deposits providing a measure of liquidity ilfc prior to september 2008 ilfcs traditional sources of liquidity had been collections of aircraft lease payments borrowings in the public debt markets borrowings under its 1999 and 2004 eca facilities to fund aircraft purchases proceeds of aircraft sales and income from third parties for fleet management services during the first six months of 2009 ilfc was unable to borrow in the public debt markets and due to downgrades in its short term credit rating lost access to the cpff and therefore borrowed 1 7 billion from aig funding to repay its maturing debt and other contractual obligations in addition ilfc borrowed approximately 161 million through secured financing arrangements ilfc is currently pursuing additional secured financings from banks and manufacturers ilfc has the capacity under its present facilities and indentures to enter into secured financing of approximately 5 0 billion or more through subsidiaries that qualify as non restricted subsidiaries under ilfcs indentures subject to the receipt of any required consents under the frbny facility and under its bank facilities and terms loans if ilfc does not receive sufficient secured financing aig expects that ilfcs current borrowings and future cash flows from operations which may include aircraft sales will be inadequate to permit ilfc to meet its existing obligations therefore aig intends to provide support to ilfc through august 15 2010 to the extent that secured financing aircraft sales and other sources of funds are not sufficient under its current long term debt ratings ilfc needs written consent from the security trustee of its 2004 eca facility before it can fund airbus purchases under the facility ilfc financed 24 aircraft under the facility during the first six months of 2009 18 of which required written consent which was obtained ilfcs current credit ratings also require segregation of security deposits and maintenance reserves related to aircraft funded under both its 1999 and 2004 eca facilities into separate accounts at june 30 2009 ilfc had segregated approximately 264 million of deposits and maintenance reserves as a result of moodys downgrade of ilfcs long term debt ratings to baa3 on july 31 2009 ilfc will be required to segregate subsequent rental payments on the aircraft funded under its 2004 eca facility and may be required to transfer control of the segregated rentals maintenance reserves and security deposits related to these aircraft currently 192 7 million to the security trustee of the facility ilfc may also be required to file individual mortgages on the aircraft funded under the facility in the respective local jurisdictions in which its lessees operate the amount of funds segregated fluctuates with changes in the related deposits maintenance reserves and debt maturities further downgrades by s and p and moodys could impose additional restrictions under the 1999 eca facility including the requirement to segregate rental payments and to receive prior consent to withdraw funds from the segregated accounts aigfp prior to september 2008 aigfp had historically funded its operations through the issuance of notes and bonds gia borrowings other structured financing transactions and repurchase agreements in the second half of 2008 aigfps access to its traditional sources of liquidity was significantly reduced and it relied on aig parent to meet most of its liquidity needs aigfps asset backed commercial paper conduit curzon funding llc was accepted into the cpff with a total borrowing limit of 7 2 billion and had approximately 6 2 billion outstanding at july 29 2009 separately a structured investment vehicle sponsored but not consolidated by aigfp nightingale finance llc was also accepted into the cpff with a borrowing limit of 1 1 billion as of july 29 2009 this vehicle had issued approximately 1 1 billion under the cpff if aigs short term ratings are downgraded these entities may lose access to the cpff and would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper 98 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents a rollforward of the amount of collateral posted by aigfp data table removed agf prior to september 2008 agfs traditional source of liquidity has been collections of customer receivables and borrowings in the public markets with its continued inability to access traditional capital market sources agf anticipates that its primary source of funds to support its operations and repay its obligations will be customer receivable collections in order to improve cash flow from operations agf has significantly limited its lending activities and aggressively managed its expenses since september 2008 and through july 2009 agfs alternative funding sources have included proceeds of 1 4 billion from real estate loan portfolio sales and initial cash proceeds of 967 million from a real estate loan securitization agf is considering additional sales and or securitizations of its finance receivables aig intends to provide support to agf through august 15 2010 to the extent that asset sales securitizations and or other transactions are not sufficient in march 2009 aig made a 600 million capital contribution to agf through aig capital corporation and agf loaned 800 million to aig parent under a demand note with aigs continued support aig believes that agf will have adequate funds to meet its debt and other obligations payable during the next twelve months aigcfg aig believes that the funding needs of aigcfg have stabilized but it is possible that renewed customer and counterparty concerns could substantially increase aigcfgs liquidity needs in 2009 during the first six months of 2009 and through july 31 2009 aig has completed the sale of certain aigcfg businesses in china thailand the philippines and mexico asset management asset managements principal cash requirements are to fund general working capital needs investment commitments related to proprietary investments in private equity and real estate as well as any liquidity mismatches in the spread based investment business management continues to work closely with partners and counterparties to manage future funding requirements on proprietary investments through various strategies including through relinquishing rights in certain properties and funds and the restructuring of investment relationships cash requirements related to institutional asset management are funded through general operating cash flows from management and performance fees proceeds from events in underlying funds capital calls to third parties sale of portfolio companies etc as well as intercompany funding provided by aig consequently institutional asset managements ability to fund certain of its needs may depend on advances from aig under various intercompany borrowing facilities restrictions on these facilities would have adverse consequences on the ability of the business to satisfy its obligations with respect to the global real estate business investing activities are also funded through third party financing arrangements which are secured by the relevant properties the guaranteed investment contract gic and mip programs are in run off aig expects to fund its obligations under these programs through cash flows generated from invested assets principal and interest as well as sales of investments primarily fixed maturity securities however market illiquidity and diminished values within the investment portfolios may impair aigs ability to sell the related program assets or sell such assets for a 99 american

inc and subsidiaries outlook global financial markets recovered somewhat in the second quarter of 2009 with investors apparently anticipating a bottoming out of the economic recession this relative optimism increased liquidity and perceived stabilization of the financial sector and mortgage markets precipitated a rally in bond equity and commodity markets prices which had been severely depressed in recent quarters stabilized and in some cases rose significantly certain sectors such as commercial mortgages and municipal bonds continue to experience lagged effects of the recession and thus the price rally while widespread was not uniform as aig implements the proposed transactions with the frbny described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and executes its plans for repaying the frbny facility aig expects to incur significant additional restructuring related charges such as accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment asset and potentially the write off of intangible assets further if aig continues to incur losses in its businesses aig may need to write off material amounts of goodwill and deferred tax assets on june 10 2009 the treasury department issued regulations implementing the compensation limits of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 these regulations restrict the amount of bonus and other incentive compensation that a company may pay to certain employees for aig these limits apply to the five executives named in aigs proxy statement and the next twenty highest paid employees of aig the regulations also create the office of special master for tarp executive compensation which is responsible for interpreting and applying the compensation regulations aig is required to obtain the special masters approval of the compensation of aigs five named executives and next 20 most highly compensated employees and the compensation structure of aigs executive officers and 100 most highly compensated employees given the restrictions on compensation contained in these regulations and the necessity of obtaining special master approval for compensation of aigs most highly compensated employees it is possible that aig may be unable to create a compensation structure that permits aig to retain its highest performing employees almost all of aigs businesses were adversely affected in the first half of 2009 by the criticism and negative publicity that surrounded the honoring of and payment of retention contracts to employees of aigfp for a discussion of the effect that continued or renewed criticism or additional negative publicity may have on aig see item 1a risk factors in part ii of aigs quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended march 31 2009 general insurance aigs general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance and various personal lines both domestically and abroad and constitute commercial insurance and the foreign general insurance group on july 27 2009 it was announced that aigs general insurance would undergo a rebranding and would do business as chartis which will consist of commercial insurance operating as chartis u s foreign general insurance operating as chartis international and private client group part of chartis u s aigs commercial insurance operations have been generally successful in retaining clients however some clients have reduced the number of lines or limits of coverage this trend of de risking is due in part to the overall state of the economy as well as continued concerns over aigs financial strength new business production has also been impacted by the economic downturn primarily in workers compensation construction transportation and real estate lines of business rates in the second quarter remained stable reflecting the upward pressure on premiums from the combination of investment and underwriting losses suffered by the commercial insurance industry partially offset by the effects of the current recessionary environment such as employment levels for workers compensation coverages and shipments of goods for commercial automobile coverages as well as the recent introduction of new competitors in the marketplace for third quarter 2009 foreign general insurance expects to be able to maintain solid client retention rates in key regions and achieve satisfactory underwriting results despite the challenging environment the trend of de risking by some customers and the economic downturn will continue to adversely affect foreign generals net premiums written primarily through a decline in new business production although foreign general continues to face challenges in commercial lines particularly in the u k and europe regions due to increased competition and 108 american international group inc and subsidiaries worldwide credit related insurance exposures its traditional capabilities of servicing its customers innovation and claims paying ability continue to attract new accounts life insurance and retirement services aig expects that negative publicity about aig during the first half of 2009 aigs previously announced asset disposition plan and the uncertainties related to aig will continue to adversely affect life insurance and retirement services operations for the remainder of 2009 especially in the domestic businesses in addition although the markets are showing signs of modest recovery the continued market disruption will adversely affect operating income for the remainder of 2009 especially with respect to deferred policy acquisition costs dac and sales inducement asset sia amortization net investment income and net realized capital gains losses in addition aigs issues have affected certain operations through higher surrender activity primarily in the u s domestic retirement fixed annuity business and foreign investment oriented and retirement products while surrender levels have declined from their peaks in mid september of 2008 they continue to be higher than historic levels in certain products and countries and aig expects surrender activity to continue to be volatile these uncertainties together with rating agency downgrades have resulted in significantly reduced levels of new sales activity particularly among products and markets where ratings are critical sales of investment oriented and retirement services products have also declined due to the general decline in the equity markets new sales activity is expected to remain at lower levels for certain markets until the uncertainties relating to aig are resolved with the transactions noted below aia and alico have experienced improved operating conditions and are expected to continue to improve as the separation from aig and rebranding initiatives continue on june 25 2009 aig and airco entered into the aia purchase agreement with the frbny and aig entered into the alico purchase agreement with the frbny the transactions contemplated by the aia purchase agreement and the alico purchase agreement are conditioned on one another and subject to certain other conditions including regulatory approvals it is expected that the transactions will result in a 25 billion permanent reduction in the frbny credit facility with the adoption of fsp fas 115 2 and fas 124 2 recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp fas 115 2 aig expects future investment yields to decline compared to the same periods in 2008 due to lower accretion in prior periods aig accreted into income over the expected period to recovery the discount or reduced premium resulting from the reduction in the cost basis of other than temporarily impaired securities which consisted primarily of securities impaired for severity reasons for the three months ended march 31 2009 this accretion totaled 342 million upon the adoption of fsp fas 115 2 approximately 1 8 billion of previously recognized other than temporarily impaired charges primarily severity related were reclassified from accumulated deficit to accumulated other comprehensive income as a consequence commencing in the second quarter of 2009 there will be no accretion attributable to the amounts reclassified into accumulated other comprehensive income this will be partially offset by lower dac and sia amortization in future periods resulting from the adoption of fsp fas 115 2 additionally higher liquidity and de risking activities continue to negatively affect net investment income margins financial services aigfp began unwinding its businesses and portfolios during the fourth quarter of 2008 and these activities are expected to continue beyond 2009 in connection with these activities aigfp has disaggregated its portfolio of existing transactions into a number of separate books and has developed a plan for addressing each book including assessing each books risks risk mitigation options monitoring metrics and certain implications of various potential outcomes each plan has been reviewed by a steering committee whose membership includes senior executives of aig the plans are subject to change as efforts progress and as conditions in the financial markets evolve and they contemplate depending on the book in question alternative strategies including sales assignments or other transfers of positions terminations of positions and or run offs of positions in accordance with existing terms execution of these plans is overseen by a transaction approval process involving increasingly senior members of aigfps and aigs respective management groups as specific actions entail greater liquidity and financial consequences successful execution of these plans is subject to varying degrees depending on the 109 american international group inc and subsidiaries transactions of a given book to market conditions and in many circumstances counterparty negotiation and agreement as a consequence of its wind down strategy aigfp is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio reduce risk and hedge the currency interest rate and other market risks associated with its affiliated businesses aigfp has already reduced the size of certain portions of its portfolio including effecting a substantial reduction in credit derivative transactions in respect of multi sector cdos in connection with the maiden lane iii llc ml iii transaction a sale of its commodity index business termination and sale of its activities as a foreign exchange prime broker and sale and other disposition of the large majority of its energy infrastructure investment portfolio due to the long term duration of many of aigfps derivative contracts and to the complexity of aigfps portfolio aig expects that an orderly wind down will take a substantial period of time the cost of executing the wind down will depend on many factors many of which are not within aigfps control including market conditions aigfps access to markets via market counterparties the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades asset management distressed global markets continue to cause depressed values of assets under management translating to lower base management fees and continued volatility in unrealized carried interest revenues for asset management operations current strained economic conditions have caused a decline in the value of certain private equity and real estate assets held for investment purposes resulting in impairment charges the persistence of the troubled global economy driven by tight credit markets and rising unemployment will likely continue to adversely affect operating income in future periods management continues to assess value declines and the permanence of such declines these market conditions have also adversely affected the ability to pay or refinance maturing debt obligations in the private equity and real estate portfolios the criticism and negative publicity about aig following the events of september 2008 and challenging market conditions have contributed to the loss of institutional and retail clients as well as significant redemptions from certain of aigs managed hedge and mutual funds client losses and redemptions have leveled off from the fourth quarter of 2008 as markets began to show signs of stabilization in the second quarter of 2009 aigs third party institutional asset management business is not expected to launch any new funds or products in the foreseeable future within the spread

considerations premiums and other considerations decreased in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a decline in commercial insurance reflecting the economys continued effect on the construction environmental and transportation lines of businesses which were negatively affected by the credit crisis that limited capital for new projects and a decline in the workers compensation line of business due to lower payrolls and aigs strategy to remain price disciplined in this business a decrease in foreign general insurance due to

securities upon the adoption of fsp fas 115 2 see note 35 to the consolidated financial statements and investments portfolio review other than temporary impairments net realized capital losses also decreased due to favorable effect of foreign exchange transactions which was offset by the effect of derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 unrealized

ended june 30 2008 113 american international group inc and subsidiaries respectively the change in the unrealized market valuation gains losses related to aigfps super senior credit default swap

accounting treatment under fas 133 which was driven by the weakening of the u s dollar against most major currencies during the second quarter of 2009 this increase was partially offset by a decline in institutional asset management revenues primarily resulting from real estate equity losses including the effect of investment impairments and lower base management fees other income for the six

other insurance expenses decreased in the three month period ended june 30 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a 243 million decrease in general insurance expenses reflecting a decline in production levels and a decrease of 192 million due to the deconsolidation of transatlantic and disposition of hsb these declines were partially offset by a 242 million increase in policy

228 million due to the deconsolidation of transatlantic and disposition of hsb group inc hsb these declines were partially offset by a 338 million increase in policy acquisition and other insurance expenses for life insurance and retirement services primarily due to higher dac unlockings of 377 million related to changes in the long term separate account growth rate assumption for domestic retirement services and restructuring costs partially offset by a higher dac benefit of 94 million related to net realized capital losses interest expense interest expense increased in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to 1 4 billion and 2 9 billion respectively of interest expense on the frbny facility which was comprised of 822

successful execution of the restructuring and asset disposition plan the awards under these retention plans were granted in 2008 and are accrued ratably over the future service periods which range from 2008 to 2011 the total amount expected to be incurred related to these 2008 retention plans is approximately 1 1 billion aig made payments to the employees under these plans in 2008 and the first six months of 2009 and expects to make further payments for the remainder of 2009 through 2011 the ultimate amount paid could be less primarily due to the effect of forfeitures amounts charged to

of 51 million in financial services to increase the cumulative amount incurred since inception for retention amounts paid in 2008 total restructuring and separation expenses could have a material effect on future consolidated results of operations and cash flows see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding restructuring and separation expenses other expenses other expenses decreased in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2009 compared to the same periods in 2008 primarily due to a decrease in compensation related costs in the financial services and asset management segments and lower interest expense on gics 115 american international group inc and subsidiaries income taxes benefits the effective tax rate on pre tax income for the three month period ended june 30 2009 was 40 0 percent the effective tax rate was negative because aig recorded a tax benefit on pre tax income the tax benefit was due primarily to a 1 8 billion decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from the effects of recently announced transactions including the sale of aigs headquarters building in tokyo this benefit was partially offset by 720 million of deferred tax expense mainly attributable to the book and tax basis differences of aig parents investment in subsidiaries primarily attributable to aigs divestiture plan and an increase of 360 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions and other discrete period items the effective tax rate on the pre tax loss for the six months ended june 30 2009 was 34 9 percent at june 30 2009 aig has recorded a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of 12 8 billion this asset was net of 4 2 billion of net deferred tax liabilities related to foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns management determined that it is more likely than not that the remaining 17 0 billion net deferred tax asset is realizable aig has also determined that no valuation allowance is required on 4 3 billion of tax benefit on available for sale fixed maturity securities that management has asserted it has the ability and intent to hold to recovery the remaining 12 7 billion of net deferred tax asset is supported based on managements assessment of future income principally related to aigs divestiture plan realization of aigs net deferred tax asset depends on aigs ability to consummate the aia and alico transactions and to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character within carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating and capital losses tax credits and deductible temporary differences were incurred estimates of future taxable income could change in the near term perhaps materially which may require aig to adjust its valuation allowance such adjustment either positive or negative could be material to aigs consolidated financial condition or its results of operations when making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax assets at june 30 2009 aig considered all available evidence including i the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses ii actions completed to date and additional actions expected to be completed iii the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards iv the sources and timing of future taxable income giving greater weight to discrete sources and to earlier years in the forecast period and v tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to accelerate taxable amounts management has also considered the period during which it expects to receive support from the frbny the effective tax rate on the pre tax loss for the three month period ended june 30 2008 was 38 4 percent the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to tax benefits from foreign operations and tax exempt interest the effective tax rate on the pre tax loss for the six month period ended june 30 2008 was 34 4 percent the effective tax rate was adversely affected by 703 million of tax charges from the first three months of 2008 comprised of increases in the reserve for uncertain tax positions tax benefits from foreign operations and tax exempt income and other discrete period items see note 12

the national association of insurance commissioners b the decrease from the december 31 2008 loss reserve amount was primarily due to the deconsolidation of transatlantic aigs gross loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including estimates for incurred but not yet reported reserves ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments resulting therefrom are currently reflected in operating income because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development estimates for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on notices of mortgage loan delinquencies and estimates of delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers based upon historical reporting trends mortgage guaranty establishes reserves using a percentage of the contractual liability for each delinquent loan reported that is based upon past experience regarding certain loan factors such as age of the delinquency cure rates dollar amount of the loan and type of mortgage loan because mortgage delinquencies and claims payments are affected primarily by macroeconomic events such as changes in home price appreciation or depreciation interest rates and unemployment the determination of the ultimate loss cost requires a high degree of judgment aig believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans consistent with industry practice aig does

for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a

development relating to property business partially offset by favorable development from d and o healthcare and other classes a significant portion of the adverse development relating to excess casualty was related to a variety of latent exposures including construction defect exposures product aggregate exposure and pharmaceutical related exposures as well as a significant number of other large losses primarily from accident years 1998 through 2002 in addition the loss development assumptions applicable to excess casualty reserves were modified in the second quarter of 2008 to reflect

commercial insurance from accident years 2000 and prior in addition as described above for the three months ended june 30 2008 the excess casualty adverse developments reflect a variety of other latent claims and large losses as well as an approximately 90 million increase resulting from the modification of loss development factors to reflect adverse experience in excess casualty asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2008 form 10 k aigs reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground up analysis

and environmental claims count activity was as follows data table removed survival ratios asbestos and environmental the following table presents aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at june 30 2009 and 2008 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the june 30 2009 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at june 30 2008 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments in addition aigs survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007 these settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at june 30 2009 by approximately 1 0 years and 2 1 years respectively and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at june 30 2008 by approximately 1 4 years and 3 0 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aigs determination of its reserves is not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average

the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or aig may not realize a full recovery on its investment regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events the determination that an equity security is other than temporarily impaired requires the judgment of

business goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred aig performed goodwill impairment testing at june 30 2009 the impairment assessment involves a two step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and if potential impairment is present the amount of impairment is measured if any and recorded impairment is tested at the reporting unit level management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of aigs reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units including allocated goodwill the estimate of a reporting units fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market based earning multiples of the units peer companies discounted expected future cash flows external appraisals or in the case of reporting units being considered for sale third party indications of fair value if available management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test as part of the impairment test management compares the sum of the estimated fair values of all aigs reporting units with aigs fully diluted common stock market capitalization as a basis for concluding on the reasonableness of the estimated reporting unit fair values if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired the amount of impairment if any is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill the estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting units assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination an impairment charge is recognized in income to the extent of the excess management observed a narrowing of the fair

realized realization of aigs net deferred tax asset depends on aigs ability to consummate the proposed aia and alico purchase agreements and to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character within carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating and capital losses tax credits and deductible temporary differences were incurred estimates of future taxable income could change in the near term perhaps materially which may require aig to adjust its valuation allowance such adjustment either positive or negative could be material to aigs consolidated financial condition or its results of operations because the realization of the deferred tax asset relies on the completion of the proposed transactions and a projection of future taxable income aig views this as a critical accounting estimate aig is relying upon producing taxable operating profits from the businesses to be retained principally commercial insurance and foreign general insurance aig has evaluated its forecasts of future operating income and determined that there will be sufficient operating income inclusive of gains on the divestiture of businesses to realize the recorded net deferred tax asset when making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax assets at june 30 2009 aig considered all available evidence including i the nature frequency and

included in other invested assets certain short term investments separate and variable account assets certain policyholder contract deposits securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased certain trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors certain cpff and other commercial paper certain long term debt and certain hybrid financial instruments included in other liabilities the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing able and knowledgeable market participants at the measurement date the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value conversely financial instruments traded in other than active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment an active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis an other than active market is one in which there are few transactions the prices are not current price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers or in which little information is released publicly for the asset or liability being valued pricing observability is affected by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions aig management is responsible for the determination of the value of the financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions with respect to securities aig employs independent third party valuation service providers to gather analyze and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments when aigs valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote which is generally non binding or by employing widely accepted internal valuation models valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and through the use of widely accepted internal valuation models provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of service agreements the inputs used by the valuation service providers include but are not limited to market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities interest rate yield curves credit spreads currency rates and other market observable information as applicable the valuation models take into account among other things market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term interest rate credit rating industry sector and when applicable collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information when market transactions or other market observable data is limited the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased aig employs specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair values of aigs financial assets and financial liabilities aigs processes are designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value aig assesses the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers through various analytical techniques in addition aig may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from aigs valuation service providers to other third party valuation sources for selected securities aig also validates prices for selected securities obtained from brokers through reviews by members of 164 american international group inc and subsidiaries management

least one significant input that is unobservable these measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability aigs assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment in making the assessment aig considers factors specific to the asset or liability in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 165 american international group inc and subsidiaries valuation of level 3 assets and liabilities aig values its assets and liabilities classified as level 3 using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices and rates yield curves credit curves measures of volatility prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs some of which may be unobservable the following paragraphs describe the methods aig uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified in level 3 private equity

inception aigs maiden lane interests were valued at the transaction prices of 1 billion and 5 billion respectively subsequently maiden lane interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the assets to which the maiden lane interests are entitled and the discount rates applicable to such interests as derived from the fair value of the entire asset pool the implicit discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with aigs interests in the capital structure of the respective entities estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated to the extent possible using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools structure and terms the fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in ml ii and ml iii will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets of ml ii and ml iii other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ

by counterparties during the first six months of 2009 aigfp reclassified one regulatory capital cds transaction from regulatory capital corporate loans to regulatory capital other given the higher likelihood that it will not be terminated when the regulatory capital benefit expires for the counterparty aig does not believe that at this time the cds provides significant risk transfer benefit to the counterparty however aigfp will continue to monitor this transaction closely during april 2009 aigfp effected the early termination of a cds transaction written on a european rmbs security of 1 5 billion in net notional amount that was reported as part of regulatory capital other at march 31 2009 at a level approximating its fair value at that time given its unique structure and concentrated exposure to high loan to value spanish residential mortgages this transaction had exposed aigfp to a relatively higher level of liquidity and credit risk than any other regulatory capital cds exposure and aig felt it prudent to terminate the transaction to avoid further deterioration in light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data to the extent deemed relevant and available aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the six months ended june 30 2009 other than for transactions where aigfp believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above although aigfp believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties the counterparties early termination rights and aigfps expectation that such rights will be exercised preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions 169 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents

provided to aigfp for the underlying pools of residential mortgages of these transactions however information with respect to principal amount outstanding defaults recoveries remaining term property use geography interest rates and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to aigfp for such referenced pools all of the regulatory capital cds transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution or its affiliates receiving the credit protection rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties in the vast majority of transactions the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the cds either directly or through an intermediary as further discussed below aigfp receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets aigfp also obtains other information such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer the nature of the information provided or otherwise available to aigfp with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital cds transaction is not consistent across all transactions furthermore in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage 171 american international group inc and subsidiaries transactions the pools are blind meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to aigfp in addition although aigfp receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools virtually all of the regulatory capital cds transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude aigfps public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets the originating financial institutions calculation agents or trustees each a report provider provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below including for those within the blind pools while much of this information received by aigfp cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information it does provide a sufficient basis for aigfp to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value for regulatory capital cds transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans aigfp receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more report providers for each such referenced pool detailing with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool the principal amount outstanding and defaults in virtually all of these reports aigfp also receives information on recoveries and realized losses aigfp also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography industry and when not publicly rated the counterpartys assessment of the credit quality of the underlying corporate loans additionally for a significant majority of these regulatory capital cds transactions upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to any corporate loan included in any such pool aig receives a notice detailing the identity or identification number of the borrower notional amount of such loan and the effective date of such credit event ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available but aigfp estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the report providers to rating agency criteria the percent non investment grade information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the cds transactions which is determined by the individual transaction structures for example small and medium enterprise sme loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large well established enterprises however the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the sme loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools in addition the transaction structures reflect aigfps assessment of the loan collateral arrangements expected recovery values and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss the percentage of non investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably the four pools containing the highest percentages of non investment grade obligations which include all transactions with pools having non investment grade percentages greater than 45 00 percent are all granular sme loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions the average number of loans in each pool is over 7 000 this large number of smaller balance loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool each transaction benefits from a tranche junior to it which was still rated aaa by at least two rating agencies at june 30 2009 only one other pool has non investment grade percentage greater than 30 00 percent but this transaction has 2 50 years remaining benefits from a reserve account which absorbs losses prior to any tranche being impacted has no realized losses from inception through june 30 2009 after the application of the reserve account and has a tranche junior to it which was rated aaa by two rating agencies at june 30 2009 approximately 0 25 percent of the assets underlying the corporate loan transactions are in default the percentage of assets in default by transaction was available for all transactions and ranged from 0 00 percent to 1 03 percent for regulatory capital cds transactions written on underlying pools of residential mortgages aigfp receives quarterly reports for each such referenced pool detailing with respect to the residential mortgages comprising such pool the aggregate principal amount outstanding defaults and realized losses these reports include additional information on delinquencies for the large majority of the transactions and recoveries for substantially all transactions aigfp also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography for the underlying residential mortgages the stratification tables also include information on remaining term property use and interest rates for a large majority of the transactions delinquency information for the mortgages underlying the residential mortgage transactions was available on approximately 75 14 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount and mortgages delinquent more than 30 days ranged from 0 13 percent to 4 29 percent averaging 0 79 percent for all but three transactions which 172 american international group inc and subsidiaries comprised less than 1 20 percent of the total gross transaction notional amount the average default rate expressed as a percentage of gross transaction notional amount was 0 27 percent and ranged from 0 01 percent to 2 16 percent the default rate on the remaining three transactions ranged from 4 11 percent to 11 95 percent the subordination on these three transactions ranged from 30 52 percent to 39 04 percent where the rating agencies directly rate the junior tranches of the pools aig monitors the rating agencies releases for any affirmations or changes in such ratings as well as any changes in rating methodologies or assumptions used by the rating agencies to the extent available the tables below show the percentage of regulatory capital cds transactions where there is an immediately junior tranche that is rated and the average rating of that tranche across all rated transactions aigfp analyzes the information regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying pools of assets to make its own risk assessment and

collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi sector cdos 178 american international group inc and subsidiaries regulatory capital relief transactions as of june 30 2009 76 1 percent of aigfps regulatory capital relief transactions measured by net notional amount were subject to a credit support annex csa and 23 9 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions in general each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand alone master agreement or similar agreement under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction the underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies from one counterparty to another and there is no standard formula the varied mechanisms resulted from varied negotiations with different counterparties the following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio reference to market indices under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index such as either itraxx or cdx this mechanism is used for cds transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages while the market index is not a direct proxy it has the advantage of being readily obtainable market value of reference obligation under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the difference between the net notional amount of a referenced rmbs security and the securitys market value expected loss models under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses generally determined using a rating agency model negotiated amount under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between aigfp and the counterparty which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by aigfp the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio prior to consideration of transactions other than aigfps super senior credit default swaps subject to the same master agreements as of the periods ended were as follows there were no collateral postings on this portfolio prior to march 31 2008 data table removed collateral calls aigfp has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps of which a large majority relate to multi sector cdos to a lesser extent aigfp has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage 179 american international group inc and subsidiaries the amount of collateral postings with respect to aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions as of the periods ended were as follows data table removed the amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of aigs credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor while a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined given the severe market disruption lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption aigfp is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future valuation sensitivity arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aigs calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average for any quarterly period during the past year prices for cdos declined between 5 57 percent and 11 93 percent of the notional amount outstanding further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current dislocated market conditions for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the total 9 2 billion net notional amount of cds written on multi sector cdos outstanding at june 30 2009 a bet value is available for 5 5 billion net notional amount no bet value is determined for 3 7 billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 5 5 billion as mentioned above the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities given their significantly depressed valuations given the current difficult market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo at this time 180 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents key inputs used in the bet model and the potential increase decrease to the fair value of the derivative liability by abs category at june 30 2009

input as a discount curve consists of a series of data points these results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption no assurance can be

to the specific business needs of each operating unit the investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses general insurance life insurance retirement services and asset management spread based investment business the primary objectives are liquidity preservation of capital growth of surplus and generation of investment income to support the insurance products difficult market conditions in recent quarters have significantly hindered aigs ability to achieve these objectives and these challenges are expected to persist for the foreseeable future at the local operating unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at aig consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities in the case of life insurance and retirement services companies as well as in the gic and mip portfolios of the asset management segment the fundamental investment strategy is to match as nearly as is practicable the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets fixed maturity securities 183 american international group inc and subsidiaries held by the insurance companies included in commercial insurance historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in light of aigs net operating losses in the third quarter of 2008 aig changed its intent to hold to maturity certain tax exempt municipal securities held by its insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities held by foreign general insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities the market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components including interest rate environment credit spread embedded optionality such as call features liquidity structural complexity foreign exchange risk and other credit and non credit factors however in most circumstances pricing is most sensitive to interest rates such that the market price declines as interest rates rise and increases as interest rates fall this effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities aig records at fair value the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies pursuant to fas 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and related accounting pronouncements however with limited exceptions primarily with respect to separate account products consolidated on aigs balance sheet pursuant to sop 03 01 aig does not adjust the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities and falling interest rates have the opposite effect this results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains losses on securities in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative inverse changes in gains losses on aigs liabilities because aigs asset duration in certain low yield currencies particularly japan and taiwan is shorter than its liability duration aig views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the fair value of its fixed maturity

losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year in order to control this exposure aig uses a combination of techniques including setting aggregate limits in key business units monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect aigs operating results other risks such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease like the swine flu influenza a virus h1n1 could adversely affect aigs business and operating results to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance programs pandemic influenza on june 11 2009 the world health organization who raised its alert level to 6 and declared that the new variant influenza a h1n1 had reached pandemic alert status although aig continues to monitor the developing facts current evidence suggests that a resulting pandemic will be of moderate severity with some chance that it could be severe to date the virus has been mostly mild the virus is occurring disproportionately in younger people and there is some evidence that individuals over 60 may have some resistance to the virus due to pre existing immunity individuals infected generally recover fully after a few days and hospitalization rates have been low however it should be noted that as of july 7 three instances had been identified in which the h1n1 virus demonstrated a resistance to tamiflu the preferred treatment for the virus the emergence of this resistant virus or the emergence of a more virulent virus during the on coming northern hemisphere flu season could result in a more severe pandemic a significant global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on life insurance and retirement services operating results and liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity rates utilizing a scenario based approach and an industry standard model aig has analyzed its insurance risk associated with pandemic influenza for a severe event considered to be a recurrence of the 1918 flu pandemic the analysis indicates aig could incur a pre tax loss of approximately 6 3 billion if this event were to recur for a mild event considered to be a recurrence of the influenza epidemic of 1968 the analysis indicates aig could incur a pre tax loss of approximately 0 6 billion if such an event were to recur these analyses were based on 2008 policy data representing approximately 95 percent of aigs individual life group life and credit life books of business net of reinsurance at that point in time these estimates do not include claims that could be made under other policies such as business interruption or general liability policies and does not reflect estimates for losses resulting from disruption of aigs own business operations or asset valuation losses that may arise consequent to such a pandemic these related losses may be significant
