present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results some of the measurements we use are nongaap financial measures under sec rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the nongaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarlynamed measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and book value per common share excluding aoci and deferred tax assets dta are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in book value per common share book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding book value per common share excluding aoci and dta is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci and dta by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive overview section of this md and a return on equity after tax operating income excluding aoci and return on equity after tax operating income excluding aoci and dta are used to show the rate of return on shareholders equity we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from

equity excluding average aoci return on equity after tax operating income excluding aoci and dta is derived by dividing actual or annualized after tax operating income attributable to aig by average aig shareholders equity excluding average aoci and dta the reconciliation to return on equity the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive overview section of this md and a we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided in the results of operations section of this md and a on a consolidated basis 77 table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures after tax operating income attributable to aig is derived by excluding the following items from net income attributable to aig these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions and measures that we believe to be common to the industry for example certain ratios and other metrics described below data table removed operating revenue excludes net realized capital gains losses income from non operating litigation settlements included in other income for gaap purposes and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits included in net investment income for gaap purposes we use the following operating performance measures within our commercial insurance and consumer insurance reportable segments as well as corporate and other commercial insurance property casualty and mortgage guaranty consumer insurance personal insurance pretax operating income includes both underwriting income and loss and net investment income but excludes net realized capital gains and losses other income and expense net and non operating litigation reserves and settlements underwriting income and loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred acquisition expenses and general operating expenses ratios we along with most property and casualty insurance companies use the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss our ratios are calculated using the relevant information calculated under gaap and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes 78 table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact in excess of 10 million each catastrophes also include certain man made events such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the 10 million threshold we believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an on going basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of managements control we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results commercial insurance institutional markets consumer insurance retirement and life pretax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from pretax income data table removed premiums and deposits includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies group benefit policies and lifecontingent payout annuities as well as deposits received on universal life investmenttype annuity contracts and mutual funds corporate and other

insurance pretax operating income decreased in the three month period ended june 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an underwriting loss compared to underwriting income from property casualty in the same period in the prior year and lower returns on alternative investments which resulted in a decrease in net investment income in property casualty and institutional markets the underwriting loss for property casualty was driven primarily by higher catastrophe losses and net loss reserve discount charge compared to a benefit in the prior year this impact was partially offset by an improvement in the accident year loss ratio as adjusted lower net adverse prior year loss reserve development and lower general operating expenses as compared to the same period in the prior year the decline in property casualty underwriting results was partially offset by an increase in underwriting income from mortgage guaranty resulting from an improved combined ratio commercial insurance pretax operating income decreased in the six month period ended june 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower underwriting income in property casualty and lower returns on alternative investments which resulted in a decrease in net investment income partially offset by an increase in underwriting income from mortgage guaranty the underwriting results for property casualty were impacted by significantly higher catastrophe losses and a net loss reserve discount charge compared to a benefit in the same period in the

rates used for discounting our investment portfolio performance declined in the three month period ended june 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower returns on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields as we reinvest cash flows from investments including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolio these decreases were partially offset by higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected our investment portfolio performance declined in the six month period ended june 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments primarily related to negative performance in hedge funds and lower reinvestment yields partially offset by an increase in invested assets and higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected net realized capital gains increased in the three month period ended june 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due primarily to higher realized capital gains from sales of investments primarily from the sale of a portion of our picc investment in addition other than temporary impairment charges decreased due to an impairment charge on our previously held aercap investment recognized in the second quarter of 2015 we recorded net realized capital losses in the six month period ended june 30 2016 primarily due to foreign exchange losses and impairments which were slightly higher than the gain recognized on the sale of a portion of our picc investment compared to net realized capital gains in the same period in the prior year which was driven primarily by foreign exchange gains and net gains on the sales of various securities such as the class b shares of prudential financial see md and a investments net realized capital gains and losses for further discussion in keeping with our broad and on going efforts to transform aig

investments in structured securities mortgage loans and other fixed income investments with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 18 0 billion as of june 30 2016 from approximately 8 8 billion as of december 31 2015 due to a decline in interest rates

common stock on august 2 2016 of 0 32 per share payable on september 29 2016 to shareholders of record on september 15 2016 strategic outlook industry trends our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates currency exchange rates credit and equity market conditions catastrophic claims events regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2016 characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates instability in the global equity markets volatile energy markets slowing growth in china and euro zone economies and the united kingdom the uk advisory referendum in which a majority voted for the uk to withdraw its membership in the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit the recent brexit vote has also affected the 87 table of contents item 2 executive overview u s dollar british pound exchange rate increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro british pound and the japanese yen the major currencies and created volatility in the financial markets which may continue for some time interest rates remain low relative to historical levels and certain markets in which we operate are experiencing negative interest rates a sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable annuities and spread management strategies for our investment oriented products for investment oriented products in our retirement life and institutional markets operating segments our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads using asset liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads lowering interest crediting rates can help offset the impact of lower investment yields but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment contractual minimum crediting rates and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre established intervals as a result the timing and extent of crediting rate decreases may differ from the corresponding declines in investment yields which could reduce our spreads and future profitability a sustained low interest rate environment may favorably affect surrender activity of contract holders whose contractual minimum crediting rates are above those currently available in the marketplace in addition customers are currently seeking fixed annuities with longer surrender charge periods in pursuit of higher returns which may help mitigate the increase of surrenders if interest rates rise rapidly in the future spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize dac and related reserves for investment oriented products if future profit assumptions change significantly we may be required to recalculate dac and related reserves and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income additionally for certain traditional long duration products for which we are unable to adjust interest rates including structured settlements and other payout annuities our future earnings may be reduced in a sustained low interest rate environment and we may be required to record additional reserves the impact of low interest rates on our property casualty operating segment is primarily on our long tail casualty line of business we expect limited impacts on our existing long tail casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities we do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long tail casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates however we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection for our property casualty operating segment and run off insurance lines reported within corporate and other sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers compensation and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves additionally sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense currency volatility in the first half of 2016 was acute compared to recent years as the euro and the british pound weakened considerably against the u s dollar although the japanese yen strengthened against the u s dollar in that period such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations in particular growth trends in net premiums written reported in u s dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies the net effect on underwriting results however is significantly mitigated as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected these currencies may continue to fluctuate in either direction especially as a result of the uks potential exit from the eu and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in u s dollars as well as financial statement line item comparability 88 table of

conditions and industry trends commercial insurance expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels currency volatility and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to limit growth and profitability in some markets and challenge growth of net investment income due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry commercial insurance has continued to diversify its business focusing on growing profitable segments and geographies exiting unprofitable lines and developing advanced data and analytics to improve profitability property casualty property casualty has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may partially offset the effect of current economic challenges in the first half of 2016 the property casualty insurance industry experienced growth in certain classes of business in property and financial lines property casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will continue at a faster pace than in developed countries but at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions as a result of its ongoing strategy to optimize its portfolio and maintain underwriting discipline property casualty expects that net premiums written for the u s casualty line and to a lesser extent certain lines within specialty and property will continue to decrease throughout the remainder of the year in addition the recent brexit 89 table of contents item 2 executive overview referendum may negatively affect premium production in the european market both on a reported basis and in original currency overall property casualty experienced a modest increase in rate pressure in the first half of 2016 property casualty expects that trend to continue in the near term particularly in certain lines including in the u s property excess and surplus market property casualty continues to differentiate its underwriting capacity from its peers by leveraging its global footprint diverse product offering risk engineering expertise and significant underwriting experience in the u s property casualtys exposure to terrorism risk

guaranty during the first half of 2016 the u s market for purchase originations and refinance volume remained strong favorably impacted by improving housing prices and low interest rates in addition the current economic environment has favorably impacted incurred losses through fewer new delinquencies and higher cure rates if the current economic environment persists mortgage guaranty expects to benefit through increased purchase volume and increased refinancing activity mortgage guaranty also expects that the delinquency rate and cure rate will remain near current levels throughout 2016 mortgage guaranty believes the combination of the factors described above will result in favorable operating results for 2016 these favorable trends may be partially offset by an increase in competitive pricing pressure on december 31 2015 the private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements pmiers issued by fannie mae and freddie mac collectively the gses became effective mortgage guaranty met the pmiers requirements as of june 30 2016 mortgage guarantys minimum required assets under pmiers were 2 9 billion as of june 30 2016 and its estimated available assets were 3 3 billion exceeding the required assets by 400 million available assets decreased from 3 6 billion at december 31 2015 primarily as a result of dividend payments institutional markets institutional markets is expected to continue growing its assets under management from the structured settlement business and the stable value wrap business as well as from disciplined growth through the pursuit of select opportunities related to pension buyouts volatility in the earnings of our alternative investment portfolio will continue to affect institutional markets results in addition institutional markets could incur loss recognition reserve increases if future yield assumptions were lowered on assets that support certain long duration products primarily structured settlements for which institutional markets does not have the ability to adjust interest rates lower assumptions for future yields on such assets could result from reinvestment of portfolio cash flows in the sustained low interest rate environment which may include proceeds from the strategic sale of alternative investments that currently support such products 90 table of contents item 2 executive overview strategic initiatives

client risk services and delivering a better client experience customer our vision is to be our clients most valued insurer we expect that investments in underwriting claims services client risk services science and data will continue to differentiate us from our peers and drive a superior client experience for example during the fourth quarter of 2015 we increased global commercial property limits to 2 5 billion per occurrence from 1 5 billion in response to increased demand for capacity and services from clients managing complex global risks and increasing property values this increase was the result of recent investments in engineering and analytical capabilities which in turn allowed us to secure meaningful support from a panel of long standing reinsurers sharpen commercial focus exit or remediate targeted underperforming portfolios commercial insurance is focused on serving our clients by providing the products and services where we have the most potential to deliver value experience and emerging data indicate that there are consistently under performing sub segments of our business we will invest and grow where we see opportunity and we will exit or remediate underperforming portfolios for example in 2015 we transferred approximately 1 2 billion of loss reserves to our run off insurance lines and in the first half of 2016 we transferred another 1 3 billion this enables us to focus on growth opportunities while allowing for more proactive management of the transferred reserves by run off specialists we also did not renew certain accounts that did not meet our profit objectives in our casualty lines and to a lesser extent in our property and specialty lines we will continue to further enhance our risk selection process and refine technical pricing through enhanced tools and analytics to achieve this goal 91 table of contents item 2 executive overview drive efficiency narrow geographic footprint while continuing to maintain and improve multinational capabilities commercial insurance along with our other businesses continues to evaluate the markets and geographies that provide the greatest opportunities while maintaining the global footprint that our multinational clients greatly value additionally we will continue to leverage our various off shore centers taking advantage of opportunities to centralize and standardize processes and platforms we believe there is great opportunity to further streamline our global operating model expand and optimize the use of reinsurance and other risk mitigating strategies commercial insurance continues to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broadbased risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units implementing underwriting strategies to increase roe by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends commercial insurance remains focused on enhancing its global reinsurance strategy to improve overall capital efficiency although this strategy may lead to periodic income statement volatility in accordance with our strategic plan during the first quarter of 2016 we entered into a two year reinsurance arrangement with the swiss re group under which a proportional share of our new and renewal u s casualty portfolio is being ceded this arrangement is reducing the impact of the u s casualty loss ratio on our overall loss ratio accelerate micro segmentation of risks using internal and external data property casualty continues to improve decision making risk acceptance and pricing based on its ongoing efforts to refine segmentation by customer industry and geography for example after enhancing the segmentation of workers compensation property casualty has observed different experience and trends which helps inform its risk appetite pricing and loss mitigation decisions invest to grow grow most profitable lines property casualty continues to focus on growth in our higher value businesses while investing in transformative opportunities continuing initiatives to modernize our technology and infrastructure advancing our engineering capabilities innovating new products and client risk services and delivering a better client experience property casualty expects to grow in businesses such as financial lines including d and o cyber and mergers and acquisitions large limit and middle market property multinational and certain areas internationally mortgage guaranty expects to continue as a leading provider of mortgage insurance and seeks to differentiate itself from its competitors by utilizing its proprietary risk based pricing strategy this pricing strategy provides mortgage guarantys customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with the underwriting risk which we believe will result in an appropriately priced high quality book of business as announced on january 26 2016 we plan to conduct an initial public offering of up to 19 9 percent of mortgage guaranty subject to regulatory and gse approval as a first step towards a full separation on march 30 2016 an initial form s 1 registration statement relating to mortgage guaranty was filed with the sec an amendment to the initial form s 1 was filed on may 20 2016 institutional markets is expected to continue growing the structured settlement business and continue contributing to growth in assets under management with stable value wraps and utilizing a disciplined approach to growth and diversification of our business by pursuing select opportunities in areas such as the pension buyout business 92 table of contents item 2 executive overview consumer insurance outlook and strategic initiatives market conditions and industry trends retirement increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement the strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in this product space in response to the continued low interest rate environment which has added pressure to profit margins we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates in addition higher tax rates and a desire for better investment returns have prompted less risk averse investors to elect products without guaranteed living benefits the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on investment returns which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products although our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads in

tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit the investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for non life insurance companies life insurance companies and aig parent the primary objectives are generation of investment income preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities investments highlights during the six months ended june 30 2016 a decline in interest rates resulted in an increase in our net unrealized gain position in our investment portfolio net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 18 0 billion as of june 30 2016 from approximately 8 8 billion as of december 31 2015 we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income our alternative investments portfolio performance experienced a significant decline in the six month period ended june 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to increased volatility in equity markets which affected the performance of our hedge fund portfolio primarily in the first quarter of 2016 during the six months ended june 30 2016 we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by 1 4 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure blended investment yields on new investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called other than temporary impairments increased slightly due to higher impairments within the energy sector and in our structured securities portfolio we recognized gains on sales of securities in the six month period ended june 30 2016 primarily due to the sale of a portion of our picc investment the recent brexit vote has created increased volatility in exchange rates as well as within the equity markets which may continue for some time investment strategies investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification some of our key investment strategies are as follows fixed maturity securities held by the u s insurance companies included in non life insurance companies consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk return tax liquidity credit quality and diversification objectives 139 table of contents item 2 investments outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by non life insurance companies consist primarily of high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate while more of a focus is placed on asset liability management in life insurance companies our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics to the extent practicable aig parent included in corporate and other actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and duration aig parents liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer term funding needs aig parent purchases publicly traded investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity investments by legal entity category the following tables summarize the composition of aig investments data table removed a at both june 30 2016 and december 31 2015 approximately 90 percent and 10 percent of investments were held by domestic and foreign entities respectively b includes the effect of eliminations and consolidations 140 table of contents item 2 investments the following table presents the components of net investment income data table removed a beginning in the first quarter of 2016 the presentation of income on alternative investments has been refined to include only income from hedge funds private equity funds and affordable housing partnerships prior period disclosures have been reclassified to conform to this presentation hedge funds for which we elected the fair value option are recorded as of the balance sheet date other hedge funds are generally reported on a one month lag while private equity funds are generally reported on a one quarter lag b includes changes in fair value of certain fixed maturity securities where the fair value option has been elected and which are used to economically hedge interest rate and other risks related to our variable annuity guaranteed living benefits for the three month periods ended june 30 2016 and 2015 the net investment income loss recorded on these securities was 120 million and 87 million respectively for the six month periods ended june 30 2016 and 2015 the net investment income loss recorded on these securities was 253 million and 43 million respectively net investment income decreased for the three month period ended june 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments and lower reinvestment yields partially offset by higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected net investment income decreased for the six month period ended june 30 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower income on alternative investments primarily related to negative performance in hedge funds and lower reinvestment yields partially offset by higher gains on securities for which the fair value option was elected non life insurance companies for the non life insurance companies the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines as a result the investment strategy within the non life insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital subject to liability and other business considerations the non life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans while invested assets backing reserves of the non life insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields particularly in the domestic operations in addition we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset backed investments for their risk return attributes as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates this asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged we expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the non life insurance companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current riskreturn and tax objectives in addition the non life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio fixed maturity investments of the non life insurance companies domestic operations with a duration of 4 7 years are currently comprised primarily of tax exempt securities which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds government and agency bonds and corporate bonds the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings 141 table of contents item 2 investments fixed maturity investments held in the non life insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings with a duration averaging 3 4 years life insurance companies the investment strategy of the life insurance companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value subject to liquidity requirements capital constraints diversification requirements assetliability management and available investment opportunities the life insurance companies use assetliability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses the life insurance companies fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that to the extent practicable complements the characteristics of liabilities including duration which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities and as a result certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates primarily due to lower lapses which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio the life insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies structured securities collateralized by among other assets residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans in addition the life insurance companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields while a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental component of the investment strategy of the life insurance companies we intend to reduce the overall size of the hedge fund portfolio in light of changing market conditions and perceived market opportunities and to continue reducing the size of the private equity portfolio the life insurance companies monitor fixed income markets including the level of interest rates credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve the life insurance companies frequently review their interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for their new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment the low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity in addition there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain inforce business specifically the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities fixed maturity investments of the life insurance companies domestic operations with a duration of 6 8 years are comprised of taxable corporate bonds as well as taxable municipal and government bonds and agency and nonagency structured securities the majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings fixed maturity investments held in the life insurance companies foreign operations are of high quality primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings with a duration averaging 15 3 years naic designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office svo of the national association of insurance companies naic evaluates the investments of u s insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called naic designations in general naic designations of 1 highest quality or 2 high quality include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade while naic designations of 3 through 6 generally include fixed maturity securities referred to 142 table of contents item 2 investments as below investment grade the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities including non agency rmbs and cmbs which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies

subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment charge for available for sale fixed maturity securities that is not foreign exchange related we generally prospectively accrete into

the amortization of certain dac e item count is by cusip by subsidiary change in unrealized gains and losses on investments the change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the second quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities for the six month period ended june 30 2016 net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by 9 2 billion due to a decrease in interest rates and narrowing of credit spreads the change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the second quarter of

sale of ordinary shares of aercap for the six months ended june 30 2015 net realized capital gains on investments in the three month period ended june 30 2016 were primarily driven by gains on the sale of a portion of our picc investment net realized capital losses in the six month period ended june 30 2016 were primarily related to foreign exchange losses and impairments which were slightly higher than the gain recognized on the sale of a portion of our picc investment foreign exchange gains losses were primarily due to 105 million of remeasurement gains and 378 million of remeasurement losses in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 respectively for a short term intercompany balance that was matched with available for sale investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in the same foreign currencies unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale investments were recorded in other comprehensive income resulting in an immaterial impact on our overall equity or book value per share from this arrangement the short term intercompany liability and related available for sale securities described above relate to subsidiaries that are recognized on a reporting period that is different from our condensed consolidated financial statements consistent with our accounting policy therefore our results of operations through june 30 2016 do not include effects of the foreign currency fluctuations for the month ended june 30 2016 on the intercompany arrangement and related available for sale securities as a result of the recent brexit vote and its impact on foreign currency rates we estimate that the foreign currency remeasurement loss on the intercompany liability through june 2016 amounted to approximately 460 million any

accordance with practices prescribed or permitted by new york pennsylvania and delaware new york rules generally do not permit non tabular discounting on ibnr and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to case reserves pennsylvania permits non tabular discounting of ibnr and approved variable discount rates determined using risk free rates based on the u s treasury forward yield curve plus a liquidity margin applicable to ibnr and case reserves delaware has permitted discounting on the same basis as the pennsylvania domiciled companies the net decreases in workers compensation discount in the amounts of 299 million and 289 million respectively in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 compared to the prior year periods were primarily due to the decrease in forward yield curve rates used for discounting under the prescribed or permitted practices the decrease in the forward yield curve component of the discount rates resulted in a 270 million and 281 million decrease in the loss reserve discount in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 compared to the prior year periods due to a decrease in both treasury rates and credit spreads which generally decreased along the payout pattern horizon in addition there was a 62 million and 89 million reduction for accident years 2015 and prior for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 respectively primarily from accretion of discount on reserves for those periods this decrease was partially offset by a 33 million and 81 million addition for newly established reserves for accident year 2016 in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 respectively the impact of changes in treasury rates and credit spreads on workers compensation reserve discount generally is economically offset by unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities backing these reserves 161 table of contents item 2 insurance reserves non life insurance companies recorded in other comprehensive income resulting in a modest impact on our overall equity and book value per common share quarterly reserving conclusion aig net loss reserves represent our best estimate of the liability for net losses and loss adjustment expenses as of june 30 2016 while we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that our recorded loss reserves will not develop adversely in future years and materially exceed our loss reserves as of june 30 2016 in our opinion such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual

sources including actual claims data the performance of prior reserve estimates observed industry trends our internal peer review processes including challenges and recommendations from our enterprise risk management group as well as the views of third party actuarial firms we use these sources to improve our evaluation techniques and to analyze and assess the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business our analyses produce a range of indications from various methods from which we select our best estimate we analyze and evaluate the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the lower or higher than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business in other cases the lower or higher than expected emergence may result in a change either favorable or unfavorable as appropriate we make adjustments in response to the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year as part of our reserving process we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues in particular those related to complex claims related class action litigation and latent exposure claims in the three month period ended june 30 2016 the adverse prior year loss reserve development was 7 million which was primarily driven by adverse development from primary workers compensation and other and domestic catastrophes partially 163 table of contents item 2 insurance reserves non life insurance companies offset by property excluding catastrophes both domestically and internationally international specialty lines and international consumer personal insurance during the second quarter of 2016 the florida supreme court issued two separate rulings that have increased the potential liability for workers compensation claims in that state by undoing certain aspects of regulations in place since 2003 the castellanos ruling eliminated statutory caps on claimant attorney fees in certain cases and the westphal ruling eliminated the 104 week limitation on temporary total disability benefits also in the second quarter the florida court of appeals issued the miles decision declaring unconstitutional certain restrictions on claimant paid attorney fees we have evaluated the potential impact of these decisions on our loss reserves and have recognized adverse prior year development for primary workers compensation in the current quarter of approximately 100 million we are continuing to monitor the impact of these decisions and may adjust our estimate as new facts and data emerge in the six month period ended june 30 2016 the favorable prior year loss reserve development was 59 million which was primarily driven by favorable development from property excluding catastrophes both domestically and internationally international specialty lines and international consumer personal insurance partially offset by domestic catastrophes as well as primary workers compensation and other resulting from the florida court rulings described above in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2015 the adverse prior year loss reserve development was 317 million and 341 million respectively which was driven by increased automobile claim severity in excess and primary casualty as well as adverse development from asbestos and environmental 1986 and prior and run off environmental 1987 to 2004 this was partially offset by property excluding catastrophes both domestically and internationally we recognized return premiums on loss sensitive business of 22 million and

estimates asbestos and environmental the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2015 annual report our reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect comprehensive groundup and top down analyses performed periodically in the six month period ended june 30 2016 we increased our gross asbestos incurred losses by 3 million due to accretion of discount while our net asbestos incurred losses increased by 1 million for the same period our gross and net environmental incurred losses remained unchanged in the six month period ended june 30 2015 we increased our gross

businesses offer variable annuity products with riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features which include gmwb and gmab the liabilities for gmwb and gmab are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates equity prices credit spreads and market volatility in addition to risk mitigating features in our variable annuity product design we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb and gmab including exposures to changes in interest rates equity prices credit spreads and volatilities the hedging program utilizes derivative instruments including but not limited to equity options futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election see 166 table of contents item 2 insurance reserves life insurance companies enterprise risk management life

annuity hedging program for which the fair value option has been elected are excluded from pre tax operating income of the retirement operating segment the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting primarily due to differences between the gaap valuation of the embedded derivatives and the economic hedge target the non performance or own credit spread adjustment npa which adjusts the rate used to discount projected benefit cash flows for the gaap valuation of the embedded derivatives is excluded from the economic hedge target when corporate credit spreads widen the change in the npa generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a gain and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten the change in the npa generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a loss see differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target below the following table presents the net increase decrease to consolidated pre tax income from changes in the fair value of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and related hedges data table removed losses from the increase in the fair value of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivative liabilities excluding the npa were significantly offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedging portfolio in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 the increase in the liabilities excluding the npa was primarily due to decreases in market interest rates during the periods as a result of corporate spreads tightening the change in the npa also increased the embedded derivative liabilities and contributed to the small negative net impact on pre tax income for the three month period ended june 30 2016 however for the six month period ended june 30 2016 the change in the npa partially offset the increase in the liabilities and contributed to the positive impact on pre tax income net of hedging increases in market interest rates and the impact of widening credit spreads on the npa in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2015 resulted in decreases in the gmwb and gmab embedded derivative liabilities during those periods which were offset by hedging to a lesser extent than in the same periods in the current year resulting in a net positive impact on consolidated pre tax income in the periods ended june 30 2015 the changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives including the npa were significantly offset in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 and offset to a lesser extent in the same periods in the prior years by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio 167 table of contents item 2 insurance reserves life insurance companies changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option has been elected are used as a capital efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread related risk effective june 30 2015 we discontinued our u s treasury bond interest rate hedging program and initiated a corporate bond hedging program which is intended to provide the same capital efficiency as the previous u s treasury bond hedging program the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 reflected increases in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program due primarily to decreases in market interest rates which partially offset the interest rate and credit spread related increases in the embedded derivative liabilities the three and six month periods ended june 30 2015 reflected decreases in the fair value of the u s treasury bond hedging program due to increases in market interest rates which partially offset the interest rate related decreases in the embedded derivative liabilities the change in the fair value of these bonds is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of income loss changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative contracts which included swaps swaptions and futures resulted in gains in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 due to decreasing market interest rates compared to losses in the prior year resulting from increasing market interest rates losses from the change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts which included futures and options were relatively higher in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2016 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to more favorable equity market returns differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target which represents an estimate of the underlying economic drivers of the embedded derivatives the economic hedge target differs from the gaap valuation of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives due to the following rider fees are 100 percent included in the economic hedge target present value calculations the gaap valuation reflects those collected fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero actuarial assumptions for gaap are adjusted to remove explicit risk margins including margins for policyholder behavior and fund basis risk and use best estimate assumptions for the economic hedge target and npa is excluded from the discount rates used for the economic hedge target the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program the life insurance companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns which may be either positive or negative realized volatility versus implied volatility actual versus expected changes in the hedge target related to items not subject to hedging particularly policyholder behavior and risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge

the five year facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and or standby letters of credit of up to 4 5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in november 2020 as of june 30 2016 a total of 4 5 billion remains available under the five year facility our ability to borrow under the five year facility is not contingent on our credit ratings however our ability to borrow under the five year facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal operating administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the five year facility these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the five year facility would restrict our access to the five year facility and could have a material

commercial real estate values interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange inflation and their levels of volatility we are engaged in a variety of insurance investment and other financial services businesses that generate market risk directly and indirectly we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off balance sheet exposures the chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks then ensuring that they are appropriately measured monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the chief market risk officer cmro the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains documented risk taking authorities defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite

with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function risk identification market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad external predominantly market observable risks financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations financial condition liquidity and capital each of the following systemic risks is considered a market risk equity prices we are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares investments in private equity hedge funds and mutual funds exchange traded funds and other equity linked capital market instruments as well as equity linked insurance products including but not limited to index annuities variable annuities universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance residential and commercial real estate values our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments changes in residential commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential commercial mortgages residential commercial mortgagebacked securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential commercial mortgages trusts that include residential commercial real estate and or mortgages residential mortgage insurance contracts and commercial real estate investments interest rates interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make certain of our product offerings less attractive to investors conversely higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons however when rates rise quickly there can be a temporary asymmetric gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value which is largely reported in other comprehensive income and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities financial liabilities insurance contracts including but not limited to fixed rate annuities variable annuities and derivative contracts credit spreads credit spreads measure an instruments risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration defaultfree instrument changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including but not limited to corporate bonds abs mortgage backed securities aig issued debt obligations credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments much like higher interest rates wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the longterm in the short term quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities which is largely reported in other comprehensive income a precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the creditworthiness of bond obligors potentially resulting in default losses 187 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management foreign exchange fx rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income assets and liabilities denominated in and significant capital deployed in a variety of currencies changes in fx rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash

inflation indices and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly via indexing or implicitly through medical costs or wage levels risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures at the firmwide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aigs risk appetite statement this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels at the market risk level the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis in addition we continue to use enhanced economic gaap accounting and statutory capitalbased risk measures at the market risk level businessunit level and firmwide levels this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures we use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities and a one percent increase in prices of equity securities scenario analysis scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in worldwide equity markets scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses stress testing stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spreads of rmbs or cmbs during 2008 188 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management market risk sensitivities the following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed a at june 30 2016 the analysis covered 297 6 billion of 312 8 billion interest rate sensitive assets excluded were 7 5

across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations b the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag foreign currency denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated nonu s dollar assets less our consolidated nonu s dollar liabilities on a gaap basis we use a bottom up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level we manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency denominated debt issued by aig parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk including but not limited to the execution of cross currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt at the aig parent level we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits as a matter of general practice we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries our foreign currency denominated net asset position at june 30 2016 decreased by 753 million compared to december 31 2015 the decrease was mostly due to a 1 3 billion decrease in our hong kong dollar position primarily resulting from the 189 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management sale of our non life insurance companies picc investment partially offset by a 529 million increase in our japanese yen position primarily resulting from unrealized appreciation of investments for illustrative purposes we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u s dollar the estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short term cash collateral or other financial obligations failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency reduced operating flexibility increased costs reputational harm and regulatory action aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity during both the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due aig liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow it to meet its obligations over a twelve month horizon consistent with its risk appetite we maintain target levels for required liquidity and or minimum coverage ratios expected to ensure that our short term financial obligations are met under varying market conditions if we project that we will breach these tolerances we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions however the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements risk identification the following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short term financial obligations as they come due market monetization risk assets cannot be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs or cause us to realize losses exceeding our expectations cash flow mismatch risk discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls event funding risk additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings a market event or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options financing risk we may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions aig specific issues or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding risk measurement comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk we produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows in addition we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity 190 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management we use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure including target liquidity range target liquidity range specifies the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a twelve month horizon under stressed liquidity conditions coverage ratios coverage ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon the portfolio of potential assets to be monetized is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon cash flow forecasts cash flow forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon stress testing coverage ratios are re measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows liquid assets and or other funding sources relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to aig parent and business unit risk committees the frequency content and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity based on its complexity risk profile activities and size critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment data table removed 191 table of contents item 2 critical accounting

authorities including insurance securities derivatives investment advisory and thrift regulators in the united states and abroad our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business the insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years on june 3 2016 the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb issued for public comment a notice of proposed rulemaking npr on enhanced prudential standards that would require insurer nonbank sifis such as aig to comply with a corporate governance and risk management standard and a liquidity risk management standard these proposed standards build on the frbs current guidance for large financial institutions supervised by the frb and have been tailored to insurance companies we are reviewing the proposals and analyzing how our current practices compare to those required by the npr we anticipate that the npr will attract industry comment under the npr after the frb evaluates all comments and adopts a final rule the insurer nonbank sifis would have at least twelve months to comply on june 3 2016 the frb also released for public comment an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr outlining two conceptual insurance group capital frameworks that could apply to insurance groups supervised by the frba building block approach proposed for insurance institutions that are savings and loan holding companies or bank holding companies by virtue of owning depository institutions and a consolidated approach for insurer nonbank sifis such as aig in general the consolidated approach would consolidate an insurance companys assets and insurance liabilities into risk segments tailored to account for the liability structure and unique features of the insurance company apply risk factors to each segment and then set minimum capital requirements the anpr does not provide details on specific risk weights risk factors capital adequacy ratios and other important elements that could be applied to aig under the consolidated approach and we cannot predict how such an approach if applied to aig would affect our business results of operations financial condition or capital requirements we are currently reviewing the anpr and expect it to be subject to significant industry comment on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which a majority voted for the uk to withdraw its membership in the eu commonly referred to as brexit the referendum is advisory and the terms of withdrawal are subject to a formal negotiation period that has not yet begun and could by treaty last up to two years it is not clear at this stage and may not be for some time what form the
