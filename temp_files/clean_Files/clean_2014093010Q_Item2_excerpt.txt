table removed 78 table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures use of non gaap measures throughout this md and a we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful representative and transparent some of the measurements we use are nongaap financial measures under sec rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the nongaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarlynamed measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci is used to show the amount of our net worth on a pershare basis we believe book value per common share excluding aoci is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of noncash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio and foreign currency translation adjustments book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive overview section of this md and a we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of aig and our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance

pretax operating income loss includes both underwriting income loss and net investment income but excludes net realized capital gains losses other income expense net and legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above underwriting income loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred acquisition expenses and general operating expenses ratios aig property casualty along with most property and casualty insurance companies uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of claims and claims adjustment expense and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and combined

from strong equity market performance net realized capital gains increased in the three month period ended september 30 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year due to gains on foreign

2014 respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year net investment income for our insurance operations increased by approximately 202 million for the three month period ended september 30 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher income on alternative investments which continued to benefit from strong equity market performance net investment income for our insurance operations decreased by approximately 57 million for the nine month period ended september 30 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower reinvestment yields and lower income on assets for which we elected the fair value option partially offset by higher income on alternative investments while corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed income securities with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 18 1 billion as of september 30 2014 from approximately 11 7 billion as of december 31 2013 due to a decline

modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in certain markets aig property casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will occur

life and retirement strategic initiatives and outlook data table removed 89 table of contents item 2 executive overview market conditions and industry trends baby boomers reaching retirement age expect to live longer in retirement and place less reliance on traditional pensions and government retirement benefits than previous generations these demographic trends combined with favorable equity markets and low volatility have provided a favorable environment for sales of individual variable annuities and have contributed to growth in separate account assets under management in the retirement income solutions product line an increasing demographic of americans approaching retirement and seeking guaranteed income features combined with changes in the competitive landscape provide opportunities to continue growing aig life and retirements position in the individual variable annuities market the interest rate environment has a significant impact on the life and annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on long term investment returns negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products such as fixed annuities and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products low interest rates may also affect future investment margins and may affect the recoverability and amortization rate of dac assets in variable annuity fixed annuity and universal life businesses the modest increase in rates since the first quarter of 2013 provided some improvement in demand for fixed annuity products in the first half of 2014 but long term interest rates have continued to remain low relative to historical levels as long as the sustained low interest rate environment continues market conditions will be challenging particularly for the fixed annuity market aig life and retirement will continue to actively manage renewal and new business crediting rates also as market conditions change asset and liability interest rate exposures and strategic asset allocation are managed to emphasize lower or higher durations in the investment portfolio product diversity and capacity for growth aig life and retirement has been able to meet the demand for guaranteed products and grow sales while managing risk by offering competitive products with strong de risking features such as volatility control funds rider fees indexed to a market volatility index and required minimum allocations to fixed accounts and to the volatility control funds and using a dynamic risk management hedging program in addition to individual variable annuities the retirement income solutions product line is expanding the offerings of index annuities including those with guarantee features to provide additional income solutions for consumers approaching retirement sales in the fixed annuities product line improved in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year but were dampened in the three month period ended september 30 2014 by the continued low interest rate environment sales of fixed annuities could improve if interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens as these market conditions make fixed annuity products more attractive compared to alternatives such as bank deposits industry sales of individual life products have continued an overall downward trend aig life and retirement is targeting growth by offering differentiated product solutions to better meet consumer needs and by expanding distribution of life products through new channels and relationships while maintaining pricing discipline as an integral component of its overall strategy the institutional markets product line is expected to continue contributing to growth in assets under management from increased stable value wrap business in the defined contribution market as well as from disciplined growth through the pursuit of select opportunities related to the terminal funding and pension buyout business 90 table of contents item 2 executive overview other operations strategic initiatives and outlook mortgage guaranty ugc data table removed market conditions and industry trends beginning in the third quarter of 2013 higher residential mortgage interest rates reduced refinancing activity however in the third quarter of 2014 the rate of decline in new insurance written was reduced as residential mortgage interest rates began to stabilize ugc anticipates that new insurance written for the remainder of 2014 and 2015 will continue to be impacted by rate volatility as well as competition in the market place while higher residential mortgage interest rates have had an unfavorable impact on new mortgage loan volumes particularly on refinancing activity ugc expects current residential mortgage interest rates to have a favorable impact on the persistency of business written from 2011 through 2013 since refinancing of mortgage loans would be unattractive to homeowners who originated mortgages at the historically low residential mortgage interest rates prevalent during that period ugc expects that this higher persistency will continue to benefit its results throughout 2014 and into 2015 ugc also expects that newly reported delinquencies will decline during 2014 and into 2015 and cure rates will improve as a result of home value appreciation which will encourage homeowners with delinquent mortgages to refinance or sell and purchase another home ugc believes the combination of higher persistency lower new delinquencies and improving cure rates partially offset by a decline in new mortgage loan volumes will result in favorable operating results for ugc for the remainder of 2014 and into 2015 ugcs continued success as well as the success of the mortgage insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in regulatory and legislative developments and changes in the charters and business practices of freddie mac and fannie mae collectively the gses on july 10 2014 the gses issued in draft form for public comment new eligibility requirements used to approve private mortgage insurers that provide insurance on loans owned or guaranteed by the gses it is unclear what the final eligibility requirements will be however if adopted as issued new requirements would include among other things higher capital requirements and heightened liquidity requirements the national association of insurance commissioners the naic has begun drafting a new model law for mortgage insurance a primary focus of the naics effort is to develop a risk based capital rbc model that will replace or supplement the current 25 1 risk to surplus requirements this rbc model law may impact the amount of statutory surplus certain ugc subsidiaries must maintain in addition the new model law may have an impact on various other business practices such as underwriting and claims mitigation practices in addition to possible impacts on liquidity and other financial thresholds 91 table of contents item 2 executive overview ugc cannot predict the potential effects new gse eligibility requirements and a new model law may have on its business results of operations cash flows and financial condition strategic initiatives risk selection for the remainder of 2014 and into 2015 ugc expects to continue to be a leading private provider of mortgage insurance and to differentiate itself from its competitors by providing superior service and products to its customers by utilizing its proprietary risk based pricing strategy this pricing strategy provides ugcs customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with the underwriting risk which ugc believes will result in an appropriately priced high quality book of business ugc plans to continue to execute this strategy throughout 2014 and into 2015 the business generated under this strategy which was initiated during 2009 accounted for approximately 69 percent of net premiums earned in the nine month period ended september 30 2014 global capital markets aig markets acts as the derivatives intermediary between aig and its subsidiaries and third parties to provide hedging services for aig entities the derivative portfolio of aig markets consists primarily of interest rate and currency derivatives the remaining derivatives portfolio of aigfp consists primarily of hedges of the assets and liabilities of the dib and a portion of the legacy hedges for aig and its subsidiaries aigfps derivatives portfolio consists primarily of interest rate currency credit commodity and equity derivatives additionally aigfp has a credit default swap portfolio that is being managed for economic benefit and with limited risk the aigfp portfolio continues to be wound down and is managed consistently with our risk management objectives although the portfolio may experience periodic fair value volatility it consists predominantly of transactions that we believe are of low complexity low risk or currently not economically appropriate to unwind based on a cost versus benefit analysis direct investment book the dib consists of a portfolio of assets and liabilities held directly by aig parent in the mip and certain nonderivative assets and liabilities of aigfp the dib portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due even under stress scenarios and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives the dibs assets consist primarily of cash shortterm investments fixed maturity securities issued by corporations u s government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset backed securities the value of these assets is impacted by macroeconomic trends in u s and core european markets including corporate credit spreads commercial and residential real estate markets and to a lesser extent interest rates and foreign exchange rates among other factors the majority of these assets are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through earnings the dibs liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other shortterm financing obligations the dib has both liabilities held at cost and liabilities held at fair value the liabilities held at fair value vary in price based on changes in aigs credit spreads with changes in fair value reflected in earnings changes in the fundamental drivers of the fair value of dib assets and liabilities will create earnings volatility

quality objectives as well as current riskreturn and tax objectives the fair value of aig property casualtys invested assets portfolio increased compared to december 31 2013 primarily due to an increase in unrealized appreciation which was driven by lower interest rates and the narrowing of investment grade credit spreads quarterly and year to date net realized capital gains losses net realized capital gains increased in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to gains on sales of securities which were

loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected in pretax operating income because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase prior years estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease prior years estimates of ultimate cost are referred

results of operations liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense commencing january 1 2014 aig property casualty merged its two internal pooling arrangements into one pool and changed the participation percentages of the pool members this resulted in an additional workers compensation loss reserve discount benefit of approximately 110 million recorded during the first quarter of 2014 as a result of changes in the participation percentages and domiciliary states of the participants of the combined pool a portion of the workers compensation reserves that had been held in new york subsidiaries and discounted pursuant to new york discounting rules which generally do not permit non tabular discounting on ibnr and prescribe a fixed 5 percent discount rate for application to

and allow a variable discount rate for application to case reserves aig property casualty received a permitted practice from the delaware department of insurance to allow discounting on the same basis as its pennsylvania domiciled companies quarterly reserving conclusion aig net loss reserves represent our best estimate of our liability for net losses and loss expenses as of september 30 2014 while we regularly review the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that our ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed our loss reserves as of september 30 2014 in our opinion such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition although such events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the following table presents the rollforward of net loss reserves data table

development from prior accident years aig analyzes and evaluates the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either 121 table of contents item 2 results of operations liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense favorable or unfavorable as appropriate we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year as part of our reserving process we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues in the three month period ended september 30 2014 the net adverse prior year loss reserve development net of premium accruals of 93 million was 227 million which was primarily driven by net adverse prior year loss reserve development in u s commercial insurance partially offset by net favorable prior year loss reserve development in consumer insurance the u s commercial insurance net adverse loss reserve development was primarily driven by primary casualty especially general liability and auto liability partially offset by reserve decreases in canada casualty and financial lines as well as natural catastrophes of 31 million the net adverse prior year loss reserve development in primary casualty lines was primarily driven by several large construction defects claims and increased costs with new york labor law claims commercial auto liability had an increase in frequency of large claims in the accident years 2010 to 2013 where the economic recovery has contributed to increased frequency and severity of claims especially for claims in excess of 500 000 which generally take several years to emerge and settle the net favorable loss reserve development in canada casualty including primary and excess casualty business and financial lines was primarily due to our updated study reflecting the better than expected loss emergence over the last several calendar years we completed an updated analysis of our u s excess casualty business excluding canada in the three month period ended september 30 2014 and while we have not changed our estimate of aggregate prior year losses our revised business class segmentation led to lower 2005 and subsequent accident year estimates for non mass tort claims where we expect underwriting actions and reductions to policy limits to have a favorable effect on ultimate losses from accident years 2007 to 2013 in particular this was entirely offset by adverse development in our 2004 and prior year estimates as a result of updated loss development patterns for mass tort claims that we segmented more extensively from non mass tort claims in this business class in the nine month period ended september 30 2014 the adverse prior year loss development net of premium accruals of 157 million was 375 million which was driven by reserve increases on claims in u s commercial insurance and other u s the net adverse prior year loss reserve development in u s commercial insurance was driven by primary casualty and specialty lines partially offset by natural catastrophes while the adverse development in other u s was driven by adverse development on legacy pollution exposures 1986 and prior and run off environmental exposures 1987 2004 for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2013 the net adverse development net of premium accruals of 3 million and 83 million was 70 million and 172 million respectively which was driven by reserve increases on claims in u s commercial insurance and other u s partially offset by net favorable development in u s consumer insurance international commercial and international consumer lines the net adverse development in u s commercial insurance was primarily attributable to domestic property exposures mostly due to the increase in reserves for storm sandy with adverse development in non loss sensitive primary casualty lines driven by higher than expected legal costs on claims for construction defects claims from accident years 2004 and prior the adverse development on those classes was partially offset by case reductions on some large claims and favorable development on non natural catastrophe property business the adverse development in other u s for the nine month periods ended september 30 2013 included adverse development on legacy asbestos and environmental exposures 1986 and prior in addition the nine month period ended

relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as

reversion to the mean in estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products a long term annual asset growth assumption is applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset based fees in determining the asset growth rate the effect of short term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology whereby short term asset growth above or below the long term annual rate assumption will impact the growth assumption applied to the five year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date when actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long term growth assumption as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five year reversion to the mean period remaining below a certain rate floor or above a certain rate cap for a sustained period judgment may be applied to revise or unlock the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five year reversion to the mean period as well as the long term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods for variable annuities in the retirement income solutions product line the assumed annual growth rate has remained above zero percent for the five year reversion to the mean period and therefore has not met the criteria for adjustment however additional favorable equity market performance in excess of long term assumptions could result in unlocking in this product line in the future with a positive effect on pre tax income in the period of the unlocking dac and reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments dac

assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost we manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees policies and procedures and a stress testing and liquidity framework established by enterprise risk management erm our liquidity framework is designed to measure both the amount and composition of our liquidity to meet financial obligations in both normal and

below for additional information capital refers to the long term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses fund business growth and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances our primary source of ongoing capital generation is the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries we must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions these constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy for both aig and the individual businesses and are based on internally defined risk tolerances regulatory requirements

transaction is subject to a clearing obligation gcm is required to post collateral in amounts determined by the relevant clearing organization and gcms clearing agreements with its futures commission merchants to the extent a derivatives transaction is not subject to a clearing obligation these derivative transactions are governed by bilateral master agreements the form of which is published by the international swaps and derivatives association inc isda many of these agreements primarily between gcm and third party financial institutions require collateral postings many of gcms transactions

for aig property casualty aig life and retirement and aig parent including the dib the primary objectives are generation of investment income preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities investments highlights during the nine months ended september 30 2014 a decrease in interest rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities and narrowing of investment grade credit spreads partially offset by the widening of high yield spreads resulted in net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 18 1 billion as of september 30 2014 from approximately 11 7 billion as of december 31 2013 we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in commercial mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income net investment income benefitted from positive performance on fixed maturity securities for which we elected the fair value option primarily driven by lower interest rates as well as higher income on alternative investments which continued to benefit from strong equity market performance blended investment yields on new aig life and retirement and aig property casualty investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called other than temporary impairments remained at low levels with a small portion of impairments attributable to structured securities the sale of ilfc to aercap resulted in aig receiving a 46 percent ownership interest in the

be a temporary asymmetric gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value which is largely reported in other comprehensive income and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized credit spread or risk premium credit spreads measure an instruments risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration defaultfree instrument much like higher interest rates wider credit spreads mean more investment income in the longterm in the short term quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing securities which is 184 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management largely reported in other comprehensive income a precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the creditworthiness of bond obligors potentially resulting in default losses foreign currency exchange rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income assets and liabilities denominated in and significant capital deployed in a variety of currencies commodity prices changes in the value of commodities can affect the valuation of publiclytraded commodities commodity indices and derivatives inflation changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including debt securities linked to inflation index returns derivatives on inflation indices and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly via indexing or implicitly through medical costs or wage levels in our primary casualty business risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures at the firmwide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aigs risk appetite statement this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity we have available within our framework at the market risk level the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels under specified stress tests in addition we continue to develop economic u s gaap accounting and statutory capitalbased risk measures at the market risk level businessunit level and firmwide levels this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures we use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities a one basis point increase in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities and a one percent increase in price on equity securities scenario analysis scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in worldwide equity markets stress testing stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of rmbs or cmbs during 2008 185 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management market risk sensitivities the following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed a at september 30 2014 the analysis covered 297 billion of 314 billion interest rate sensitive assets excluded are 1 billion in dib assets 7 billion of loans and 4 billion of investments in life

sensitive assets excluded are 6 billion in dib assets 5 billion of loans and 4 billion of investments in life settlements in addition 8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling and or data limitations b commencing in the first quarter of 2014 we began using a duration and convexity method to estimate the impact of a 100 bps increase in interest rates on each security the change in method resulted in no material effect on the amounts presented at december 31 2013 c includes our investments in picc group and picc p and c d the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag foreign currency denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated nonu s dollar assets less our consolidated nonu s dollar liabilities on a u s gaap basis we use a bottom up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level we manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency denominated debt issued by aig parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk including but not limited to the execution of cross currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt at the aig parent level we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits as a matter of general practice we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries however we may utilize either cross currency swaps or our foreign currency denominated debt as a net investment hedge of our capital in subsidiaries at september 30 2014 our five largest foreign currency net asset positions were denominated in british pounds canadian dollars hong kong dollars japanese yen and singapore dollars our foreign currency denominated net asset position at september 30 2014 increased by 7 8 percent or 805 million compared to december 31 2013 the increase was mostly due to a 422 million increase in our british pound position primarily resulting from the purchase of british pounds using excess 186 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management euros to fund outflows a 326 million increase in our japanese yen position mainly attributable to japanese yen deferred tax liability reduction a 228 million increase in our hong kong dollar position primarily resulting from aig property casualtys investment in picc p and c a 159 million increase in our canadian dollar position mainly attributable to an increase in operating income from underwriting and investments and a 144 million increase in our singapore dollar position primarily due to intercompany receivables generated from declared dividends in the asia pacific region partially offset by a 374 million decrease in our euro position primarily resulting from bond hedging and the sale of excess euros to fund british pound outflows and a 172 million decrease in our polish zloty position primarily resulting from the sale of our equity investment in santander consumer bank for illustrative purposes we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u s dollar the estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short term cash collateral or other financial obligations the failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in reduced operating flexibility increased costs and reputational harm because liquidity is critically important our liquidity governance includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address aig specific broader industry and market related liquidity events sources of liquidity risk can include but are not limited to financial market movements significant changes in interest rates can provide incentives for policyholders to surrender their policies changes in markets can impact collateral posting requirements or limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs due to unfavorable market conditions inadequate market depth or other investors seeking to sell the same or similar assets potential reputational events or credit downgrade changes can have an impact on policyholder cancellations and withdrawals or impact collateral posting requirements and catastrophic events including natural and manmade disasters that can increase policyholder claims the principal objective of our liquidity risk framework is to protect our liquidity position and identify a diversity of funding sources available to meet actual and contingent liabilities during both normal and stress periods this framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a time horizon covering a period greater than one year we maintain a liquidity buffer designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions if we project that we will breach the tolerance we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions however the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements we strive to manage our liquidity prudently at a legal entity level across aig parent and the operating companies key components of the framework include effective corporate governance and policy maintaining diversified sources of liquidity contingency funding plans and regular review of liquidity metrics in both normal and stress conditions we view each component of the framework together to achieve our goal of sound liquidity risk management 187 table of contents item 2 critical accounting estimates critical
