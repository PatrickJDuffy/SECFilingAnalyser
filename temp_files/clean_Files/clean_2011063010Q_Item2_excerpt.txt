months ended june 30 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 reflecting the following fair value gains of 1 5 billion on the aia ordinary shares partially offset by the effect of the deconsolidation of aia during the fourth quarter of 2010 a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the frbny credit facility a reduction in unallocated corporate expenses principally due to the effect of securities litigation related charges recorded in the second quarter of 2010 lower levels of other than temporary impairment charges an increased underwriting loss for chartis reflecting higher catastrophe losses and a reduction in the fair value of the maiden lane interests driven by widening spreads in the first six months of 2011 income from continuing operations before income taxes declined by 2 7 billion compared to the same period in 2010 and reflected a 3 3 billion loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in the first quarter of 2011 primarily consisting of the accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset resulting from the termination of the frbny credit facility on january 14 2011 and lower fair value gains on the maiden lane interests

paid nico approximately 1 67 billion as consideration for this cession and nico assumed approximately 1 82 billion of net asbestos liabilities as a result of this transaction chartis recorded a

businesses implementing plans to maximize the value of resources available for repayment of the aia spv preferred interests held by the department of the treasury continuing to build strengthen and streamline the financial and operating systems infrastructure throughout the organization particularly in financial reporting financial operations and human resources restructuring aig operations consistent with its smaller size and plans to increase its competitiveness managing its capital more efficiently investing its available cash in order to increase its net investment income and continuing to work towards achieving the long term aspirational goals with respect to return on equity and earnings per share as discussed in aig first quarter form 10 q chartis given current property and casualty industry capital levels and overall economic conditions 2011 is anticipated to be a challenging year as chartis expects a weak growth environment in most developed economies the weakness of ratable exposures i e asset values payrolls and sales in 2010 and its negative impact on the overall market premium base as well as continued weakness in commercial insurance rates were initially expected to continue through 2011 however in the first six months of 2011 chartis has observed that the extent of ratable exposure weakness in the united states is beginning to abate in addition for the six month period ended june 30 2011 chartis u s has observed a modest overall increase in its rates for the first time since 2009 in certain growth economies such as brazil turkey india and asia pacific countries chartis expects improved growth rates in 2011 chartis continues to execute on its strategy of growing its higher margin and less capital intensive lines of business and implementing corrective actions on underperforming businesses management continues to review its underlying businesses to ensure that they meet overall performance measures while seeking to reduce the overall volatility of results in connection with these ongoing reviews during the six months ended june 30 2011 management took certain remedial actions relating to certain consumer line programs that did not meet internal performance or operating targets including the decision to reduce its net premiums written for two specific programs notwithstanding these actions chartis u s expects to continue to grow its consumer lines business and excluding these specific actions the overall consumer business continues to see growth in line with management expectations to the extent that the aforementioned weakness in ratable exposures continue to abate chartis u s expects moderate growth in both gross and net written premiums in 2011 chartis u s expects continued growth within its consumer lines business and an overall decline in certain classes of its commercial lines business because the consumer lines business generally carries higher origination costs than commercial lines business chartis u s expects an overall increase in its expense ratio due to the change in the mix of business however this increase is expected to be largely offset by on going expense saving initiatives that were introduced in 2010 chartis international expects continued growth in net written premiums in 2011 as a result of its well established franchises and operations expectations for continued globalization increased demand for liability insurance and growth in the gross domestic product within countries included in the growth economies region growth is also expected in the far east region due in large part to the full year inclusion of the fuji results compared to only six months of results in 2010 further in connection with its acquisition of a controlling interest in fuji in 2010 chartis recognized certain net intangible liabilities related to the difference between the fair value 99 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries and the carrying value of the insurance contracts acquired the amortization of these liabilities will have a beneficial impact on the expense ratio through the third quarter of 2011 strong pricing discipline in a continued soft market is expected to keep the europe region net written premiums at levels consistent with 2010 on march 11 2011 a major earthquake occurred near the northeast coast of honshu japan triggering a tsunami in the pacific ocean this disaster is referred to as the great tohoku earthquake and tsunami the tohoku catastrophe the following table summarizes chartis charges related to the tohoku catastrophe data table removed the claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred include chartis participation in the japanese earthquake reinsurance company jerc the jerc is a joint government private sector insurance system that is the exclusive provider of earthquake coverage for personal dwellings and their contents in japan under the jerc system a maximum of 5 5 trillion yen 67 billion at the june 30 2011 weighted average exchange rate of industry wide losses will be covered by the japanese government the jerc and private general insurance companies in japan through five layers of liability fuji is a 6 2 percent shareholder of the jerc as such fuji in accordance with japanese statutory accounting rules as well as the requirements of private sector participants in the jerc had previously established reserves for potential claims associated with earthquake damage to personal dwellings these reserves which are backed by funds held by the jerc exist to cover the potential losses that fuji could sustain in connection with jerc related claims given these statutory reserves and its current estimate of losses chartis expects minimal net effects on the statutory capital and liquidity of its japanese operations the tohoku catastrophe caused significant damage to japan transportation power manufacturing and service sectors and resulted in disruptions to supply chains particularly in the technology and automobile industries these disruptions have resulted in contingent business interruption cbi claims from insureds generally cbi coverage reimburses insureds for loss of business income or extra expense as a result of physical damage sustained by a supplier the insured supplier must have sustained physical damage by a peril otherwise covered by the insured property policy and subject to its respective policy terms and conditions potential cbi losses are difficult to initially ascertain due to the unique facts and circumstances of each insured supply chain and the specific conditions of its cbi coverage chartis believes that the estimated loss liabilities for this catastrophe including reserves established for cbi claims and jerc related losses are reasonable chartis has concluded that as of june 30 2011 there was no overall net change to its march 31 2011 estimate of total net losses inclusive of reinstatement premiums relating to the tohoku catastrophe however given the unprecedented nature of the catastrophe and the inherent nature of the underlying claims the subsequent development of these liabilities in future periods could vary materially from amounts included in the accompanying june 30 2011 financial statements as part of chartis ongoing strategy to reduce its overall loss reserve development risk on june 17 2011 but with retroactive effect to january 1 2011 chartis completed a transaction with national indemnity company nico a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc under which the majority of chartis u s asbestos liabilities were transferred to nico the transaction with nico covers potentially volatile u s related asbestos exposures the transaction does not cover asbestos accounts that chartis believes have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by chartis subsidiaries the transfer was effected under a reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of 3 5 billion chartis paid nico approximately 1 67 billion as consideration for this cession and nico assumed approximately 1 82 billion of net asbestos liabilities in connection with this transaction chartis recorded a deferred gain of 150 million in the second 100 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries quarter of 2011 which is being amortized into the chartis results of operations as the underlying claims are settled under gaap any future loss development on this retroactive reinsurance agreement will be reported in the period recognized through the results of operations the corresponding recovery from nico will be deferred and consistent with the original deferred gain amortized into the results of operations over the settlement period of the underlying claims consistent with aig worldwide insurance investment policy chartis places primary emphasis on investments in fixed income securities issued by corporations municipalities and other governmental agencies and to a lesser extent common stocks real estate hedge funds and other alternative investments fixed maturity securities held by chartis u s historically have consisted primarily of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in order to better optimize its overall investment portfolio including risk return and tax objectives chartis u s has begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet overall liquidity duration and quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives chartis makes determinations of other than temporary impairments based on the fundamental credit analyses of individual securities for the chartis u s other invested asset classes more specifically life settlements contracts impairments are evaluated on a contract by contract basis during the second quarter of 2011 chartis u s implemented an enhanced process in which updated medical information on individual insured lives is requested on a routine basis in cases where updated information indicates that an individual health has improved an impairment loss may arise as a result of revised estimates of net cash flows from the related contract chartis u s also revised its valuation table which it is using in estimating future net cash flows this had the general effect of decreasing the projected net cash flows on a number of contracts these changes resulted in an increase in the number of life settlement contracts identified as potentially impaired compared to previous analyses as the overall book of business continues to mature and new medical information continues to become available regarding insureds updated life expectancy assumptions may result in an increase in impairments relating to these assets at june 30 2011 chartis u s held 5 819 life settlement contracts included in other invested assets with a carrying value of 4 0 billion and a face value of 18 4 billion chartis presents its financial information in the manner in which the business is currently being managed with chartis u s and chartis international as the primary units included in the segment on march 31 2011 aig announced a reorganization of its chartis operations and named a new management team under the new structure chartis will consist of two major global groups commercial and consumer with the supporting claims actuarial and underwriting disciplines integrated into these two major business operations in addition chartis will be organized geographically as four principal regions the united states and canada europe the far east and growth economies primarily asia pacific africa the middle east and latin america during the second quarter of 2011 the newly appointed executive management team made a number of key appointments to its overall management team and certain key decisions regarding how its underlying operating segments will be organized however management continues to work on the final key elements of the new organization and operating structure as the new structure is finalized the presentation of chartis results will be modified accordingly and prior periods presentations will be modified to conform to the new reporting presentation currently chartis anticipates that it will complete its organization and operating design and related segment reporting changes in the third quarter of 2011 sunamerica sunamerica intends in 2011 to expand its distribution capabilities reposition its excess cash and liquidity maintain a strong statutory surplus pro actively manage expenses and subject to regulatory approval increase dividends paid to aig parent sunamerica made progress on all of these fronts during the first six months of 2011 101 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries sunamerica built up a large cash and short term investment position with the intention of purchasing all the assets in the maiden lane ii portfolio with the frbny decision to sell the mlii assets through a competitive sales process sunamerica began acquiring other fixed income investments including certain securities from maiden lane ii however beginning late in the first quarter of 2011 sunamerica started investing its excess cash and liquid assets in longer term higher yielding securities to improve spreads while actively managing credit and liquidity risks sunamerica made substantial progress commencing in the latter part of the first quarter of 2011 reducing its cash and short term investment position from 19 4 billion at december 31 2010 to 4 6 billion at june 30 2011 after a period of historic lows interest rates generally increased at the longer part of the yield curve during the latter part of 2010 and through the first three months of 2011 before declining in the three months ended june 30 2011 changes in the interest rate environment affect the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products although interest rates declined in the second quarter of 2011 sunamerica believes that its fixed annuity sales should continue to exceed 2010 sales levels during 2011 sunamerica sold approximately 3 4 billion of investments in order to generate capital gains to partially preserve the recoverability of the deferred tax asset relating to capital losses the reinvestment of the proceeds from these sales will ultimately create downward pressure on yields due to the current low interest rate environment sunamerica has experienced an increase in its variable annuity sales as various distribution partners have resumed sales of sunamerica products during 2010 and 2011 sunamerica largest pre financial crisis variable annuity distribution partner agreed to resume distribution of sunamerica products in mid 2011 as a result of broader distribution opportunities and improvement in the equity markets sunamerica expects continued improvement in its variable annuity sales in amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs dac value of business acquired voba and sales inducement assets sia sunamerica uses a reversion to mean methodology to account for fluctuations in separate account returns for its variable annuity business favorable separate account returns in the second half of 2011 could trigger a favorable unlocking where the reversion to mean assumption is reset in 2011 which could result in higher amortization expense in future periods such unlocking is not expected to be significant to sunamerica operating results aig life insurance companies have received industry wide regulatory inquiries with respect to claims settlement practices and compliance with unclaimed property laws aig life insurance companies are enhancing their claims practices to use information such as the social security death master file to determine when insureds have died and thus increased their estimated reserves for incurred but not reported death claims by 100 million in the second quarter of 2011 sunamerica already had robust practices relating to insurance claims settlements and compliance with unclaimed property laws that are consistent with applicable legal requirements and historical industry standards sunamerica focuses on identifying cost effective opportunities to manage certain redundant statutory reserve requirements on term insurance and universal life insurance with secondary guarantees xxx and axxx reserves through intercompany reinsurance agreements for this purpose sunamerica had a 585 million syndicated letter of credit facility and 215 million of letters of credit on a bilateral basis outstanding at june 30 2011 all of which relate to intercompany life reinsurance transactions all of these letters of credit are due to mature on december 31 2015 102 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries financial services ilfc ilfc

operations parent and other businesses in 2011 aig completed the recapitalization executed transactions in the debt and equity capital markets and substantially completed its asset disposition plan it is expected that declines in interest expense and costs associated with disposition activity will be at least partially offset in the short term by increases in unallocated expenses primarily attributable to corporate initiatives and efforts to continue improving internal controls and financial and operating technology platforms in addition parent and other operations may continue to

period in 2010 although rescissions will continue to affect ugc financial results they have declined as a percentage of claims due to a higher level of appeals and overturns resulting from additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues while these items may increase volatility in the future aig believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans after consideration of rescissions and overturns consistent with industry practice foreclosure moratoriums as a result of state attorneys general investigations into lenders

taxes interim tax calculation method in the first quarter of 2011 aig began using the estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing its interim tax provisions the recent stabilization of operations and expected financial results allow aig to estimate the annual effective tax rate to be applied to year to date income from the third quarter of 2008 through december 31 2010 the discrete period method was used to compute the interim tax provisions due to the significant variations in the customary relationship between income tax expense and pre tax accounting income which were partly due to the effects of aig asset disposition program and restructuring the estimated annual effective tax rates for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2011 reflect a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset of the u s consolidated income tax group and statutory rates were used for computing the tax expense of foreign subsidiaries certain items including those deemed to be

years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger

carried reserves survival ratios asbestos and environmental the following table presents aig survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at june 30 2011 and 2010 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments in addition aig survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007 these settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at june 30 2010 by approximately 0 3 years and 0 7 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aig determination of its reserves are not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio the following table presents aig survival ratios for asbestos and

unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at aig consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities in the case of life insurance and retirement services companies as well as in the direct investment book the fundamental investment strategy is as nearly as is practicable to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in chartis u s historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in order to meet the current risk return and tax objectives of chartis u s the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives fixed maturity securities held by chartis international companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities the market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components including interest rate environment credit spread embedded optionality such as call features liquidity structural complexity foreign exchange risk and other credit and non credit factors however in most circumstances pricing is most sensitive to interest rates such that the market price declines as interest rates rise and increases as interest rates fall this effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities aig accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value however with limited exceptions primarily with respect to separate account products on aig consolidated balance sheet aig does not modify the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities and falling interest rates have the opposite effect this results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains losses on securities in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative inverse changes in gains losses on aig liabilities because aig asset duration in certain low yield currencies particularly japan and taiwan is shorter than its liability duration aig views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous

aig considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities for most security types supported by real estate related assets current market yields continue

consisted of aigfp derivatives and assets and exposure related to other insurance and financial services operations several states local governments and other issuers are still facing pressures on their budgets from the effects of the recession and have had to cut spending increase taxes and draw on reserve funds consequently several municipal issuers in aig portfolios have been downgraded one

municipal issuers in the foreseeable future aig has credit exposures to several european governments whose ratings have been downgraded or placed under review in recent months by one or more major

estimates during 2011 for a complete discussion of aig critical accounting estimates see aig 2010 annual report on form 10 k recoverability of deferred tax asset the evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires aig to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified the more negative evidence that exists the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed aig framework for assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets weighs the sustainability of recent operating profitability the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets and its emergence from cumulative losses in recent years the framework requires aig to consider all available evidence including the sustainability of recent operating profitability of the aig subsidiaries in various tax jurisdictions the predictability of future operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the deferred tax assets the nature frequency and severity of cumulative financial reporting losses in recent years the carryforward periods for the net operating loss capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards the recognition of the gains and losses on business dispositions prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to protect against the loss of the deferred tax assets and the effect of reversing taxable temporary differences 171 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries despite several favorable developments including the completion of the recapitalization in january 2011 the active wind down of aigfp portfolios and the sale of certain businesses aig u s consolidated income tax group has experienced cumulative losses in recent years and volatility in sustainable operating profit based on this evidence at june 30 2011 aig cannot yet overcome this significant negative evidence to assert at this time that the u s consolidated income tax group deferred tax asset will be realized however aig u s consolidated income tax group has reported financial taxable income over the first half of 2011 and is currently projecting financial taxable income for the full year 2011 additionally aig u s consolidated income tax group expects to emerge from cumulative losses in recent years in the second half of 2011 these factors if realized would represent significant positive evidence therefore if these factors were to be met and based on the characteristics of the deferred tax assets the valuation allowance could be released in large part during the fourth quarter of 2011 which would materially and favorably affect net income and other comprehensive income in the period at december 31 2010 the valuation allowance for aig u s consolidated income tax group was 23 8 billion deferred policy acquisition costs short duration general insurance recoverability of dac is based on the current terms and profitability of the underlying insurance contracts policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned generally 12 months dac is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts aig assesses the recoverability of its dac on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred this assessment is performed by comparing recorded unearned premium to the sum of expected claims claims adjustment expenses and maintenance costs unamortized dac and anticipated maintenance costs if the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded unearned premium the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for dac this offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge investment income is not anticipated in assessing the recoverability of dac increases in expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge management tested the recoverability of dac and determined that recorded unearned premiums of its chartis u s and chartis international operating segments exceeded the sum of these costs at june 30 2011 by 4 percent and 19 percent respectively and therefore the dac of these reporting units was considered to be recoverable dac for chartis u s and chartis international amounted to 1 8 billion and 1 8 billion respectively at june 30 2011 fair value measurements of certain

june 30 2011 26 0 billion in net notional amount of regulatory capital cdss were terminated or matured at no cost to aigfp aigfp continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio as of june 30 2011 aigfp estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 1 22 years aigfp has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations of super senior regulatory capital cdss initiated by counterparties however during the second quarter of 2011 aigfp terminated mezzanine tranches related to certain terminated super senior regulatory capital trades and made payments which approximated their fair values at the time of termination the regulatory benefit of these transactions for aigfp financial institution counterparties was generally derived from basel i in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision finalized basel iii which when fully implemented may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions in prior years it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from basel i to an intermediate standard known as basel ii which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions at the end of 2009 basel iii has now superseded basel ii but the details of its implementation by the various european central banking districts have not been finalized should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame the weighted average expected maturity of the regulatory capital portfolio decreased as of june 30 2011 by approximately 1 9 years from december 31 2010 due to the termination of two transactions that had a longer than average weighted average maturity because the remaining counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early aigfp has extended the expected maturity dates by one year which is based on how long aigfp believes the relevant rules under basel i will remain effective these counterparties in the corporate loan and prime residential mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits under basel i rules and thus aig continues to categorize them as regulatory capital transactions during the second quarter of 2011 aigfp terminated two super senior prime residential mortgage transactions with a combined net notional amount of 24 1 billion at march 31 2011 that had previously been the subject of a collateral dispute in addition aigfp terminated the vast majority

at values that approximated their collective fair value at the time of termination subsequent to june 30 2011 additional hedge transactions with a net notional amount of 427 million were terminated at

that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2011 other than for transactions where aigfp believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above although aigfp believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties the counterparties early termination rights and aigfp expectation that such rights will be exercised preclude the

subsidiaries all of the regulatory capital cds transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution or its affiliates receiving the credit protection rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties in the vast majority of transactions the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the cds either directly or through an intermediary as further discussed below aigfp receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets aigfp also obtains other information such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer the nature of the information provided or otherwise available to aigfp with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital cds transaction is not consistent across all transactions furthermore in all corporate loan and residential mortgage transactions the pools are blind meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to aigfp in addition although aigfp receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools virtually all of the regulatory capital cds transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude aigfp public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets the originating financial institutions calculation agents or trustees each a report provider provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below including for those within the blind pools while much of this information received by aigfp cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information it does provide a sufficient basis for aigfp to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to

information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the cds transactions which is determined by the individual transaction structures all of the remaining corporate loan transactions are written on small and medium enterprise sme loan balances which tend to be rated lower than loans to large well established enterprises however the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the sme loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools in addition the transaction structures reflect aigfp assessment of the loan collateral arrangements expected recovery values and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss the percentage of non investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably one pool containing the highest percentages of non investment grade obligations which include all transactions with pools having non investment grade percentages greater than 45 percent are all granular sme loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions the number of loans in this pool is 6 160 this large number of sme loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool this transaction benefits from a tranche junior to it which was still rated aaa by at least two rating agencies at june 30 2011 two other pools with a total net notional amount of 899 million have non investment grade percentages less than 45 percent with a

among counterparties and asset classes although aigfp has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi sector cdos regulatory capital relief transactions as of june 30 2011 73 5 percent of the capital markets regulatory capital relief transactions measured by net notional amount were subject to csas linked to aig credit rating and 26 5 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions in general each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand alone master agreement or similar agreement under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction the underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty and there is no standard formula the varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties the following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio reference to market indices under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index such as either itraxx or cdx this mechanism is used for cds transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages while the market index is not a direct proxy it has the advantage of being readily obtainable negotiated amount under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between aigfp and the counterparty which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by aigfp 182 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio prior to consideration of transactions other than the capital markets super senior credit default swaps subject to the same master agreements as of the periods ended data table removed arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos in the cds transactions with physical settlement provisions in respect of multi sector cdos the standard csa provisions for the calculation of exposure have been modified with the exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying cdo security rather than the replacement value of the transaction as of any date the market value of the relevant cdo security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such cdo security in a market transaction on such date while the replacement value of the transaction is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation e g the cdo security in cases where a formula is utilized a transaction specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of exposure which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted these thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of aig and or the reference obligations with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings for the large majority of counterparties to these transactions the master agreement and csa cover non cds transactions e g interest rate and cross currency swap transactions as well as cds transactions as a result the amount of collateral to be posted by aigfp in relation to the cds transactions will be added to or offset by the amount if any of the exposure aig has to the counterparty on the non cds transactions arbitrage portfolio corporate debt clos all of the capital markets corporate arbitrage clo transactions are subject to csas these transactions are treated the same way as other transactions subject to the same master agreement and csa with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard csa procedures outlined above the vast majority of corporate debt transactions and all such transactions maturing after 2011 are no longer subject to future collateral postings in exchange for an upfront payment to an intermediary counterparty aigfp has eliminated all future obligations to post collateral on corporate debt transactions that mature after 2011 collateral calls aigfp has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps of which a large majority relate to multi sector cdos to a lesser extent aigfp has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage from time to time valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference cdo securities for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by aigfp in connection with such instruments have resulted in estimates that differ at times significantly from aigfp estimates in almost all cases aigfp has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements aigfp regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are like any other third party 183 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries valuation considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio the following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions as of the periods ended data table removed the amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of aig credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor while a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined aigfp estimates the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with its super senior credit default swaps using various methodologies the contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into aig liquidity planning assumptions valuation sensitivity arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aig calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average prices for cdos increased during 2011 further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the total 6 1 billion net notional amount of cds written on multi sector cdos outstanding at june 30 2011 a bet value is available for 3 7 billion net notional amount no bet value is determined for 2 4 billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 3 7 billion the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities while the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a cdo the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile especially given current market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo at this time 184 table of contents american
