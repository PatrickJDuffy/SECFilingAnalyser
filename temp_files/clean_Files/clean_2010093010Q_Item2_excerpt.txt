reclassifications and disclosure changes have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment aig considers its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates to be those relating to items considered by management in the determination of insurance liabilities including general insurance unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses and future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts recoverability of assets including deferred policy acquisition costs dac

nine month period the effect of recording impairments on certain consolidated investments held in the institutional asset management operations which affected the calculation of income taxes and a foreign currency adjustment while these adjustments were noteworthy for the periods after evaluating the quantitative and qualitative aspects of these corrections aig concluded that its prior period financial statements were not materially misstated and therefore no restatement was required had these and all previously reported out of period adjustments been recorded in their appropriate periods net loss attributable to aig for the year ended december 31 2009 would have increased by 578 million from 10 9 billion to 11 5 billion going concern considerations in the audited financial statements

aig anticipates re entering the long term debt market in the fourth quarter of 2010 management assessment and conclusion in assessing aig current financial position and developing operating plans for the future management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potential financial and liquidity effects of aig risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the ability of aig to complete the transactions with the frbny the department of the treasury and the trust contemplated by the recapitalization agreement in principle the commitment of the frbny and the department of the treasury to the orderly restructuring of aig and their commitment to continuing to work with aig to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due the potential adverse effects on aig businesses that could result if there are further downgrades by rating agencies including in particular the uncertainty of estimates relating to the derivative transactions of capital markets such as estimates of both the number of counterparties who may elect to terminate under contractual termination provisions and the amount that would be required to be paid in the event of a downgrade the potential for declines in bond and equity markets the pending sales of agf aig star and aig edison or the potential for delays in asset dispositions and reduction in the anticipated proceeds therefrom the potential effect on aig if the capital levels of its regulated and unregulated subsidiaries prove inadequate to support current business plans the effect on aig businesses of continued compliance with the covenants of the frbny credit agreement and other agreements with the frbny and the department of the treasury aig highly leveraged capital structure the effect of the provisions of the troubled asset relief program tarp standards for compensation and corporate governance and the determination memoranda issued by the office of the special master for tarp executive compensation with respect to aig compensation practices and structures on aig ability to retain and motivate key employees or hire new employees the potential that loss of key personnel could reduce the value of aig business and impair its ability to stabilize businesses and effect a successful asset disposition plan and 18 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited the potential for regulatory limitations on aig business in one or more countries including as a result of the recapitalization based on the u s government continuing commitment the already completed transactions with the frbny the closing of the aia ipo and the sale of alico management plans and progress made to stabilize aig businesses and dispose of certain assets and after consideration of the risks and uncertainties of such plans management believes that it will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate aig businesses execute its asset disposition plan and repay its obligations for at least the next twelve months in connection with making the going concern assessment and conclusion management and the board of directors of aig confirmed in connection with the filing in february 2010 of the 2009 annual report on form 10 k that as first stated by the u s treasury and the federal reserve in connection with the announcement of the aig restructuring plan on march 2 2009 the u s government remains committed to continuing to work with aig to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due aig consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or relating to the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should aig be unable to continue as a going concern it is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of management plans could be materially different that one or more of management significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect and that aig could fail to complete the recapitalization if one or more of these possible outcomes is realized and third party financing and existing liquidity sources including those from the u s government are not sufficient without continued support from the u s government in the future there could exist substantial doubt about aig ability to continue as a going concern accounting policies transfers of financial assets securities purchased sold under agreements to resell repurchase at contract value securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase other than those entered into by asset management direct investment business generally are accounted for as collateralized borrowing or lending transactions and are recorded at their contracted resale or repurchase amounts plus accrued interest aig direct investment business carries such agreements at fair value based on market observable interest rates and credit spreads aig policy is to take possession of or obtain a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell when aig does not obtain cash collateral sufficient to fund substantially all of the cost of purchasing identical replacement securities during the term of the contract generally less than 90 percent of the security value aig accounts for the transaction as a sale of the security and reports the obligation to repurchase the security as a derivative contract where securities are carried in the available for sale category aig records a gain or loss in income where changes in fair value of securities are recognized through income no additional gain or loss is recognized the fair value of securities transferred under repurchase agreements accounted for as sales was 2 5 billion and 2 3 billion at september 30 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively and the related cash collateral obtained was 1 9 billion and 1 5 billion at september 30 2010 and december 31 2009 respectively aig minimizes the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring customer credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be deposited with aig when necessary 19

issued an accounting standard addressing transfers of financial assets that removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe from the fasb accounting standards codification and removes the exception that exempted transferors from applying the consolidation rules to qspes the new standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning on january 1 2010 for aig earlier application was prohibited the adoption of this standard increased both assets and liabilities by approximately 1 3 billion as a result of consolidating two previously unconsolidated qspes the adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on aig consolidated results of operations or cash flows consolidation of variable interest entities in june 2009 the fasb issued an accounting standard that amends the rules addressing consolidation of certain variable interest entities with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly affect the entity economic performance and has 1 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or 2 the right to receive benefits from the entity

insurance company should not combine any investments held in separate account interests with its interest in the same investment held in its general account when assessing the investment for consolidation separate accounts represent funds for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders who bear the investment risk the standard also provides guidance on how an insurer should consolidate an investment fund in situations in which the insurer concludes that consolidation of an investment is required and the insurer interest is through its general account in addition to any separate accounts the new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on january 1 2011 for aig earlier application is permitted aig expects to

opportunities to divest nan shan and believes the proceeds from the sale of this business will approximate the amount agreed to in the fourth quarter of 2009 in addition aig believes it will complete the sale of nan shan within 12 months with similar terms and conditions therefore aig continues to classify nan shan as held for sale and as a discontinued operation this is based on management

international subsidiary purchased additional voting shares in fuji fire and marine insurance company limited fuji a publicly traded japanese insurance company with property casualty insurance operations and a life insurance subsidiary the acquisition of the additional voting shares for 145 million increased chartis international total voting ownership interest in fuji from 41 7 percent to 54 8 percent which resulted in chartis international obtaining control of fuji this acquisition was made to increase chartis international share in the substantial japanese insurance market which is undergoing significant consolidation and to achieve cost savings from synergies the purchase was accounted for under the acquisition method because the acquisition was completed on march 31 2010 the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete when aig issued its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended march 31 2010 the initial purchase price allocation was based on financial information that was available at the time to identify and estimate certain of the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of fuji as of the acquisition date during the quarter ended june 30 2010 chartis international obtained additional information and revised the purchase price allocation which included obtaining final appraisals of fuji insurance contracts loans certain real estate and intangible assets and retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts initially recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2010 adjustments to the previously reported purchase price allocation as of march 31 2010 occurred as a result of new information that became known about market conditions in the life insurance industry in japan that existed as of the acquisition date which if known would have reduced the amount recognized by chartis international as of that date for the fair value of the business acquired voba of fuji life insurance subsidiary by approximately 132 million public announcements of 28 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated

adopted indicated that market participants are managing to the target solvency margin ratios under the new solvency margin rules instead of the current solvency margin rules as a result chartis international revised its target capital assumption in its voba calculation based on the new standard in addition chartis international increased the previously reported purchase price allocation as of march 31 2010 by approximately 11 million as a result of new information received during the quarter ended september 30 2010 regarding certain assets and liabilities of fuji additional adjustments to the purchase price allocation as of march 31 2010 may occur if new information becomes known about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected

as previously reported and the revised amounts data table removed during the three months ended march 31 2010 aig reported that in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting chartis international remeasured its equity interest in fuji held prior to the acquisition of the additional shares to fair value which resulted in a 25 million loss in the first quarter of 2010 the loss was recorded in other realized capital gains losses in the consolidated statement of income loss the fair values of aig previously held equity interest and the noncontrolling interest were based on fuji publicly traded share price on the tokyo stock exchange as of the acquisition date also during the first quarter of 2010 aig reported that an insignificant amount of acquisition related costs consisting primarily of legal and transaction fees was recorded in other expenses in the consolidated statement of income loss 29 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited during the quarter ended june 30 2010 aig reported that the acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately 406 million which was

the nine months ended september 30 2010 but no portion is included for the three months ended september 30 2010 the bargain purchase gain is primarily attributable to the depressed market value of fuji common stock which aig believes is the result of macro economic capital market and regulatory factors in japan coupled with fuji financial condition and results of operations aig anticipates that the bargain purchase gain will not be subject to u s or foreign income tax because the gain would only be recognized for tax purposes upon the sale of the fuji shares the following table summarizes

measures the following financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis trading and available for sale securities portfolios certain mortgage and other loans receivable derivative assets and liabilities securities purchased sold under agreements to resell repurchase non traded equity investments and certain private limited partnerships and certain hedge funds included in other invested assets certain short term investments separate account assets certain policyholder contract deposits securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased certain trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors certain long term debt and certain hybrid financial instruments included in other liabilities the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing able and knowledgeable market participants at the measurement date the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value conversely financial instruments traded in other than active markets or those that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment an active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide 31 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited pricing information on an ongoing basis an other than active market is one in which there are few transactions the prices are not current price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers or in which little information is released publicly for the asset or liability being valued pricing observability is affected by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions fair value hierarchy assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three levels based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair values as discussed below level 1 fair value measurements that are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that aig has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities market price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer markets aig does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 include certain government and agency securities actively traded listed common stocks and derivative contracts most separate account assets and most mutual funds level 2 fair value measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 generally include certain government and agency securities most investment grade and high yield corporate bonds certain residential mortgage backed securities rmbs commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and collateralized debt obligations asset backed securities cdo abs certain listed equities state municipal and provincial obligations hybrid securities securities purchased sold under agreements to resell repurchase mutual fund and hedge fund investments certain derivative contracts guaranteed investment agreements gias for the direct investment business other long term debt and physical commodities level 3 fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that use significant inputs that are unobservable these measurements include circumstances in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety aig assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment in making the assessment aig considers factors specific to the asset or liability assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 include certain rmbs cmbs and cdo abs corporate debt certain municipal and sovereign debt certain derivative contracts including capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio policyholder contract deposits carried at fair value private equity and real estate fund investments and direct private equity investments aig non financial instrument assets that are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis generally are classified as level 3 the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments carried at fair value these methodologies are applied to assets and liabilities across the levels noted above and it is the observability of the inputs used that determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for the respective asset or liability 32 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited valuation methodologies incorporation of credit risk in fair value measurements aig own credit risk fair value measurements for certain direct investment business debt gias structured note liabilities and freestanding derivatives as well as capital markets derivatives incorporate aig own credit risk by determining the explicit cost for each counterparty to protect against its net credit exposure to aig at the balance sheet date by reference to observable aig credit default swap or cash bond spreads a counterparty net credit exposure to aig is determined based on master netting agreements when applicable which take into consideration all positions with aig as well as collateral posted by aig with the counterparty at the balance sheet date fair value measurements for embedded policy derivatives and policyholder contract deposits take into consideration that policyholder liabilities are senior in priority to general creditors of aig and therefore are much less sensitive to changes in aig credit default swap or cash issuance spreads counterparty credit risk fair value measurements for freestanding derivatives incorporate counterparty credit by determining the explicit cost for aig to protect against its net credit exposure to each counterparty at the balance sheet date by reference to observable counterparty credit default swap spreads when available when not available other directly or indirectly observable credit spreads are used to derive the best estimates of the counterparty spreads aig net credit exposure to a counterparty is determined based on master netting agreements which take into consideration all derivative positions with the counterparty as well as collateral posted by the counterparty at the balance sheet date a cds is a derivative contract that allows the transfer of third party credit risk from one party to the other the buyer of the cds pays an upfront and or annual premium to the seller the seller payment obligation is triggered by the occurrence of a credit event under a specified reference security and is determined by the loss on that specified reference security the present value of the amount of the annual and or upfront premium therefore represents a market based expectation of the likelihood that the specified reference party will fail to perform on the reference obligation a key market observable indicator of non performance risk the cds spread fair values for fixed maturity securities based on observable market prices for identical or similar instruments implicitly incorporate counterparty credit risk fair values for fixed maturity securities based on internal models incorporate counterparty credit risk by using discount rates that take into consideration cash issuance spreads for similar instruments or other observable information the cost of credit protection is determined under a discounted present value approach considering the market levels for single name cds spreads for each specific counterparty the mid market value of the net exposure reflecting the amount of protection required and the weighted average life of the net exposure cds spreads are provided to aig by an independent third party aig utilizes an interest rate based on the benchmark london interbank offered rate libor curve to derive its discount rates while this approach does not explicitly consider all potential future behavior of the derivative transactions or potential future changes in valuation inputs aig believes this approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities including consideration of the impact of non performance risk fixed maturity securities trading and available for sale aig maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value whenever available aig obtains quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure fixed maturity securities at fair value in its trading and available for sale portfolios market price data is generally obtained from dealer markets management is responsible for the determination of the value of the investments carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions aig employs independent third party valuation service providers to 33 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited gather analyze and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments when aig valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote which is generally non binding or by employing widely accepted internal valuation models valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and through the use of widely accepted internal valuation models provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of service agreements the inputs used by the valuation service providers include but are not limited to market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities benchmark yields interest rate yield curves credit spreads currency rates and other market observable information as applicable the valuation models take into account among other things market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term interest rate credit rating industry sector and when applicable collateral quality and other security or issuer specific information when market transactions or other market observable data is limited the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased aig has processes designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value aig assesses the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers through various analytical techniques in addition aig may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from aig valuation service providers to other third party valuation sources for selected securities aig also validates prices for selected securities obtained from brokers through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions the methodology above is relevant for all fixed maturity securities following are discussions of certain procedures unique to specific classes of securities fixed maturity securities issued by government entities for most debt securities issued by government entities aig obtains fair value information from independent third party valuation service providers as quoted prices are generally only available for limited debt securities issued by government entities the fair values received from these valuation service providers may be based on a market approach using matrix pricing which considers a security relationship to other securities for which a quoted price in an active market may be available or alternatively based on an income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows to a single present value amount fixed maturity securities issued by corporate entities for most debt securities issued by corporate entities aig obtains fair value information from third party valuation service providers for certain corporate debt instruments for example private placements that are not traded in active markets or that are subject to transfer restrictions valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability and such adjustments generally are based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence management

abs is limited certain inputs used to determine fair value may not be observable in the market maiden lane ii and maiden lane iii at their inception ml ii and ml iii were valued and recorded at the transaction prices of 1 billion and 5 billion respectively subsequently the maiden lane interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the maiden lane assets aig applies model determined market discount rates to its interests these discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with aig interests in the capital structure of the respective entities estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated to the extent possible using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools structure and terms the fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in the maiden lane interests will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets underlying the maiden lane interests other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts reported adjustments to the fair value of aig interest in ml ii are recorded on the consolidated statement of income loss in net investment income for aig domestic life insurance companies adjustments to the fair value of aig interest in ml iii are recorded on the consolidated statement of income loss in net investment income and beginning in the second quarter of 2009 were included in other operations results reflecting the contribution to an aig subsidiary prior to the second quarter of 2009 such amounts had been included in other parent company results aig maiden lane interests are included in bond trading securities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet as of september 30 2010 aig expected to receive cash flows undiscounted in excess of aig initial investment and any accrued interest in the maiden lane interests over the remaining life of the investments after repayment of the first priority obligations owed to the frbny aig cash flow methodology considers the capital structure of the collateral securities and their expected credit losses from the underlying asset pools the fair values of the maiden lane interests are most affected by changes in the discount rates and changes in the underlying estimated future collateral cash flow assumptions used in the valuation model the libor interest rate curve changes are determined based on observable prices interpolated or extrapolated to derive a libor for a specific maturity term as necessary the spreads over libor for the maiden lane interests including collateral specific credit and liquidity spreads can change as a result of changes in market expectations about the future performance of these investments as well as changes in the risk premium that market participants would demand at the time of the transactions changes in estimated future cash flows would primarily be the result of changes in expectations for defaults recoveries and prepayments on underlying loans 35 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited changes in the discount rate or the estimated future cash flows used in the valuation would alter aig estimate of the fair value of the maiden lane interests as shown in the table below data table removed aig believes that the ranges of discount rates used in these analyses are reasonable based on implied spread volatilities of similar collateral securities and implied volatilities of libor interest rates the ranges of estimated future cash flows were determined based on variability in estimated future cash flows implied by cumulative loss estimates for similar instruments because of these factors the fair values of the maiden lane interests are likely to vary perhaps materially from the amount estimated equity securities traded in active markets trading and

prepayment rates market pricing for comparable loans and other relevant factors freestanding derivatives derivative assets and liabilities can be exchange traded or traded over the counter otc aig generally values exchange traded derivatives using quoted prices in active markets for identical derivatives at the balance sheet date otc derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible including market based inputs to models model calibration to market clearing transactions broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency when models are used the selection of a particular model to value an otc derivative depends on the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market aig generally uses similar models to value similar instruments valuation models require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices and rates yield curves credit curves measures of volatility prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets such as generic forwards swaps and options model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means and model selection does not involve significant management judgment certain otc derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult when aig does not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions the transaction price is initially used as the best estimate of fair value accordingly when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equals the transaction price subsequent to initial recognition aig updates valuation inputs when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions third party pricing services and or broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data when appropriate valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity bid offer spreads and credit considerations such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence management best estimate is used 37 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited embedded policy derivatives the fair value of embedded policy derivatives contained in certain variable annuity and equity indexed annuity and life contracts is measured based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the

future policyholder behavior are subjective and based primarily on aig historical experience with respect to embedded policy derivatives in aig variable annuity contracts because of the dynamic and complex nature of the expected cash flows risk neutral valuations are used estimating the underlying cash flows for these products involves many estimates and judgments including those regarding

portfolio aigfp values aigfp cds transactions written on the super senior risk layers of designated pools of debt securities or loans using internal valuation models third party price estimates and market indices the principal market was determined to be the market in which super senior credit default swaps of this type and size would be transacted or have been transacted with the greatest volume or level of activity aig has determined that the principal market participants therefore would consist of other large financial institutions who participate in sophisticated over the counter derivatives markets the specific valuation methodologies vary based on the nature of the referenced obligations and availability of market prices the valuation of the super senior credit derivatives is challenging given the limitation on the availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in the structured finance market these market conditions have increased the reliance on management estimates and judgments in arriving at an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes further disparities in the valuation methodologies employed by market participants and the varying judgments reached by such participants when assessing volatile markets have increased the likelihood that the various parties to these instruments may arrive at significantly different estimates as to their fair values aig valuation methodologies for the super senior credit default swap portfolio have evolved over time in response to market conditions and the availability of market observable information aig has sought to calibrate the methodologies to available market information and to review the assumptions of the methodologies on a regular basis regulatory capital portfolio in the case of credit default swaps written to facilitate regulatory capital relief aig estimates the fair value of these derivatives by considering observable market transactions the transactions with the most observability are the early terminations of these transactions by counterparties aig continues to reassess the expected maturity of the portfolio aigfp has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties the regulatory benefit of these transactions for aigfp financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision basel i that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards issued by the basel committee on banking supervision basel ii it was expected that financial institution counterparties would have transitioned from basel i to basel ii by the end of the two year adoption period on december 31 2009 after which they would have received little or no additional regulatory benefit from these 38 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited cds transactions except in a small number of specific instances however the basel committee announced that it had agreed to keep in place the basel i capital floors beyond the end of 2009 although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various european central banking districts should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame in assessing the fair value of the regulatory capital cds transactions aig also considers other market data to the extent relevant and available for further discussion see note 8 herein multi sector cdo portfolios aig uses a modified version of the binomial expansion technique bet model to value aigfp credit default swap portfolio written on super senior tranches of multi sector collateralized debt obligations cdos of abs including maturity shortening puts that allow the holders of the securities issued by certain cdos to treat the securities as short term 2a 7 eligible investments under the investment company act of 1940 2a 7 puts the bet model was developed in 1996 by a major rating agency to generate expected loss estimates for cdo tranches and derive a credit rating for those tranches and remains widely used aig has adapted the bet model to estimate the price of the super senior risk layer or tranche of the cdo aig modified the bet model to imply default probabilities from market prices for the underlying securities and not from rating agency assumptions to generate the estimate the model uses the price estimates for the securities comprising the portfolio of a cdo as an input and converts those estimates to credit spreads over current libor based interest rates these credit spreads are used to determine implied probabilities of default and expected losses on the underlying securities this data is then aggregated and used to estimate the expected cash flows of the super senior tranche of the cdo prices for the individual securities held by a cdo are obtained in most cases from the cdo collateral managers to the extent available cdo collateral managers provided market prices for 62 7 percent of the underlying securities used in the valuation at september 30 2010 when a price for an individual security is not provided by a cdo collateral manager aig derives the price through a pricing matrix using prices from cdo collateral managers for similar securities matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the relationship of the security to other benchmark quoted securities substantially all of the cdo collateral managers who provided prices used dealer prices for all or part of the underlying securities in some cases supplemented by third party pricing services the bet model also uses diversity scores weighted average lives recovery rates and discount rates aig employs a monte carlo simulation to assist in quantifying the effect on the valuation of the cdo of the unique aspects of the cdo structure such as triggers that divert cash flows to the most senior part of the capital structure the monte carlo simulation is used to determine whether an underlying security defaults in a given simulation scenario and if it does the security implied random default time and expected loss this information is used to project cash flow streams and to determine the expected losses of the portfolio in addition to calculating an estimate of the fair value of the super senior cdo security referenced in the credit default swaps using its internal model aig also considers the price estimates for the super senior cdo securities provided by third parties including counterparties to these transactions to validate the results of the model and to determine the best available estimate of fair value in determining the fair value of the super senior cdo security referenced in the credit default swaps aig uses a consistent process which considers all available pricing data points and eliminates the use of outlying data points when pricing data points are within a reasonable range an averaging technique is applied corporate debt collateralized loan obligation clo portfolios in the case of credit default swaps written on portfolios of investment grade corporate debt aig uses a mathematical model that produces results that are closely aligned with prices received from third parties this methodology is widely used by other market participants and uses the current market credit spreads of the names in the portfolios along with the base correlations implied by the current market prices of comparable tranches of the relevant market traded credit 39 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited indices as inputs one transaction representing two percent of the total notional amount of the corporate arbitrage transactions is valued using third party quotes given its unique attributes aig estimates the fair value of its obligations resulting from credit default swaps written on clos to be equivalent to the par value less the current market value of the referenced obligation accordingly the value is determined by obtaining third party quotes on the underlying super senior tranches referenced under the credit default swap contract policyholder contract deposits policyholder contract deposits accounted for at fair value are measured using an earnings approach by taking into consideration the following factors current policyholder account values and related surrender charges the present value of estimated future cash inflows policy fees and outflows benefits and maintenance expenses associated with the product using risk neutral valuations incorporating expectations about policyholder behavior market returns and other factors and a risk margin that market participants would require for a market return and the uncertainty inherent in the model inputs the change in fair value of these policyholder

contracts traded on exchanges other long term debt when fair value accounting has been elected the fair value of non structured liabilities is generally determined by using market prices from exchange or dealer markets when available or discounting expected cash flows using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity such instruments are generally classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as substantially all inputs are readily observable aig determines the fair value of structured liabilities and hybrid financial instruments where performance is linked to structured interest rates inflation or currency risks using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above given the nature of the embedded risk profile such instruments are classified in level

september 30 2010 were trading continuously at a price below cost or amortized cost was approximately five months evaluating investments for other than temporary impairments on april 1 2009 aig adopted a new accounting standard on a prospective basis addressing the evaluation of fixed maturity securities for other than temporary impairments these requirements significantly altered aig policies and procedures for determining impairment charges recognized through earnings the standard requires a company to recognize the credit component a credit impairment of an other than temporary impairment of a fixed maturity security in earnings and the non credit component in accumulated other comprehensive income when the company does not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery the standard also changes the threshold for determining when an other than temporary impairment has occurred on a fixed maturity security with respect to intent and ability to hold the security until recovery and requires additional disclosures a credit impairment which is recognized in earnings when it occurs is the difference between the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security and the estimated present value of cash flows expected to be collected recovery value as determined by management the difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not related to a credit impairment is recognized as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss aig refers to both credit impairments and impairments recognized as a result of intent to sell as impairment charges the impairment model for equity securities was not affected by the standard impairment policy effective april 1 2009 and thereafter fixed maturity securities if aig intends to sell a fixed maturity security or it is more likely than not that aig will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security is below amortized cost an other than temporary impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings for all other fixed maturity securities for which a credit impairment has occurred the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to earnings changes in fair value compared to recovery value if any are charged to unrealized appreciation depreciation of fixed maturity investments on which other than temporary credit impairments were taken a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss when assessing aig intent to sell a fixed maturity security or whether it is more

of expected future cash flows certain critical assumptions are made with respect to the performance of the securities when estimating future cash flows for a structured fixed maturity security e g rmbs cmbs cdo abs management considers historical performance of underlying assets and available market information as well as bond specific structural considerations such as credit enhancement and

delinquency rates expected default rates and timing of such defaults loss severity and timing of any such recovery expected prepayment speeds and ratings of securities underlying structured products for corporate municipal and sovereign fixed maturity securities determined to be credit impaired management considers the fair value as the recovery value when available information does not indicate that another value is more relevant or reliable when management identifies information that supports a recovery value other than the fair value the determination of a recovery value considers scenarios specific to the issuer and the security and may be based upon estimates of outcomes of corporate restructurings political and macro economic factors stability and financial strength of the issuer the value of any secondary sources of repayment and the disposition of assets 59 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited equity securities the impairment model for equity securities and other cost and equity method investments was not affected by the adoption of the new accounting standard related to other than temporary impairments in the second quarter of 2009 aig continues to evaluate its available for sale equity securities equity method and cost method investments for impairment by considering such securities as candidates for other than temporary impairment if they meet any of the following criteria the security has traded at a significant 25 percent or more discount to cost for an extended period of time nine consecutive months or longer a discrete credit event has occurred resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or aig has concluded that it may not realize a full recovery on its investment regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events the determination that an equity security is other than temporarily impaired requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer its near term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances the above criteria also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market valuation decline in which aig could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary severity losses other invested assets aig investments in funds and investment partnerships are evaluated for impairment consistent with the evaluation of equity securities for impairments as discussed above such evaluation considers market conditions events and volatility that may impact the recoverability of the underlying investments within these funds and investment partnerships and is based on the nature of the underlying investments and specific inherent risks such risks may evolve based on the nature of the underlying investments aig investments in life settlement contracts are monitored for impairment based on the underlying life insurance policies with cash flows reported monthly an investment in a life settlement contract is considered impaired if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the expected proceeds from the insurance policy are less than the carrying amount of the investment plus anticipated continuing costs if an impairment loss is recognized the investment is written down to fair value aig aircraft asset investments and investments in real estate are periodically evaluated for recoverability whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired when impairment indicators are present aig compares expected investment cash flows to carrying value when the expected cash flows are less than the carrying value the investments are written down to fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings fixed maturity securities impairment policy prior to april 1 2009 in all periods prior to april 1 2009 aig assessed its ability to hold any fixed maturity available for sale security in an unrealized loss position to its recovery at each balance sheet date the decision to sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflected the judgment of aig management that the security sold was unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflected management judgment that the risk adjusted ultimate recovery was less than the value achievable on sale 60 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited in those periods aig evaluated its fixed maturity securities for other than temporary impairments with respect to valuation as well as credit after a fixed maturity security had been identified as other than temporarily impaired the amount of such impairment was determined as the difference between fair value and amortized cost and the entire amount was recorded as a charge to earnings 7 variable interest entities the accounting standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities vies provide guidance for determining when to consolidate certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity that is at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support consolidation of a vie by its primary beneficiary is not based on majority voting interest but rather is based on other criteria while aig enters into various arrangements with vies in the normal course of business aig involvement with vies is primarily as a passive investor in debt securities rated and unrated and equity interests issued by vies via its insurance companies in all instances aig determines whether it is the primary beneficiary or a variable interest holder based on a qualitative assessment of the vie this includes a review of the vie capital structure contractual relationships and terms nature of the vie operations and purpose nature of the vie interests issued and aig involvements with the entity aig also evaluates the design of the vie and the related risks the entity was designed to expose the variable interest holders to in evaluating consolidation for vies with attributes consistent with that of an investment company or a money market fund the primary beneficiary is the party or group of related parties that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the vie receives the majority of the expected residual returns of the vie or both for all other variable interest entities the primary beneficiary is the entity that has both 1 the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly affect the entity economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the vie while also considering these factors the consolidation conclusion depends on the breadth of aig decision making ability and its ability to influence activities that significantly affect the economic performance of the vie exposure to loss aig total off balance sheet exposure associated with vies primarily consisting of financial guarantees and commitments to real estate and investment funds was 1 5 billion

rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts aigfp typically became a principal in the exchange of interest payments between the parties and therefore is exposed to counterparty credit risk and may be exposed to loss if counterparties default currency commodity and equity swaps are similar to interest rate swaps but involve the exchange of specific currencies or cash flows based on the underlying commodity equity securities or indices also they may involve the exchange of notional amounts at the beginning and end of the transaction swaptions are options where the holder has the right but not the obligation to enter into a swap transaction or cancel an existing swap transaction aigfp follows a policy of minimizing interest rate currency

than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties in the vast majority of transactions the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the cds either directly or through an intermediary the super senior tranches of these cds transactions continue to be supported by high levels of subordination which in most instances have increased since origination the weighted average subordination supporting the prime residential mortgage and corporate loan referenced

52 percent respectively the corporate loan transactions are each comprised of several hundred secured and unsecured loans diversified by industry and in some instances by country and have per issuer concentration limits both types of transactions generally allow some substitution and replenishment of loans subject to defined constraints as older loans mature or are prepaid these replenishment rights generally expire within the first few years of the trade after which the proceeds of any prepaid or maturing loans are applied first to the super senior tranche sequentially thereby increasing

transitioned from basel i to basel ii by the end of the two year adoption period on december 31 2009 after which they would have received little or no additional regulatory benefit from these cds

corporate arbitrage portfolio consists principally of cds transactions written on portfolios of senior unsecured corporate obligations that were generally rated investment grade at inception of the cds these cds transactions require cash settlement also included in this portfolio are cds transactions with a net notional amount of 1 5 billion written on the senior part of the capital structure of clos which require physical settlement certain of the super senior credit default swaps provide the counterparties with an additional termination right if aig rating level falls to bbb or baa2 at that level counterparties to the cds transactions with a net notional amount of 6 1 billion at september 30 2010 have the right to terminate the transactions early if counterparties exercise this right the contracts provide for the counterparties to be compensated for the cost to replace the transactions or an amount reasonably determined in good faith to estimate the losses the counterparties would incur as a result of the termination of the transactions due to long term maturities of the cds in the arbitrage portfolio aig is unable to make reasonable estimates of the periods during which any payments would be made however the net notional amount represents the maximum exposure to loss on the super senior credit default swap portfolio collateral most of aigfp super senior credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions which typically are governed by international swaps and derivatives association inc isda master agreements master agreements and related credit support annexes csa these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes aigfp has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps of which a large majority relate to multi sector cdos to a lesser extent aigfp has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage the amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of aig credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor while a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined given the severe market disruption lack of observable data and the uncertainty of future market price movements aigfp is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future 71 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited at september 30 2010 and december 31 2009 the amounts of collateral postings with respect to aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions were 3 9 billion and 4 6 billion respectively aigfp written single name credit default swaps aigfp has also entered into credit default swap contracts referencing single name exposures written on corporate index and asset backed credits with the intention of earning spread income on credit exposure some of these transactions were entered into as part of a long short strategy allowing aigfp to earn the net spread between cds it wrote and ones they purchased at september 30 2010 the net notional amount of these written cds contracts was 1 7 billion aigfp has hedged these exposures by purchasing offsetting cds contracts of 260 million in net notional amount the net unhedged position of approximately 1 4 billion represents the maximum exposure to loss on these cds contracts the average maturity of the written cds contracts is 6 71 years at september 30 2010 the fair value of derivative liability which represents the carrying value of the portfolio of cds was 164 million upon a triggering event e g a default with respect to the underlying credit aigfp would normally have the option to settle the position through an auction process cash settlement or pay the notional amount of the contract to the counterparty in exchange for a bond issued by the underlying credit obligor physical settlement aigfp wrote these written cds contracts under master agreements the majority of these master agreements include csa which provide for collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels at september 30 2010 aigfp had posted 175 million of collateral under these contracts all other derivatives aig non capital markets businesses also use derivatives and other instruments as part of their financial risk management programs interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps are used to manage interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed income securities outstanding medium and long term notes and other interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in addition foreign exchange derivatives principally foreign exchange forwards and options are used to economically mitigate risk associated with non u s dollar denominated debt net capital exposures and foreign exchange transactions the derivatives are effective economic hedges of the exposures they are meant to offset in addition to hedging activities aig also uses derivative instruments with

investment program written credit default swaps aig mip operations which are reported in aig other operations category as part of asset management direct investment business are currently in run off through the mip aig has entered into cds contracts as a writer of protection with the intention of earning spread income on credit exposure in an unfunded form the portfolio of cds contracts were single name exposures and at inception were predominantly high grade corporate credits these contracts were written through aig markets which then transacted directly with unaffiliated third parties under isda agreements as of september 30 2010 the notional amount of written cds contracts was 3 9 billion with an average credit rating of bbb at that date the average maturity of the written cds contracts was 1 7 years and the fair value of the derivative liability which represents the carrying value of the mip written cds was 53 million the majority of the isda agreements include csa provisions which provide for collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels at september 30 2010 21 million of collateral was posted for cds contracts related 72 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited to the mip the notional amount represents the maximum exposure to loss on the written cds contracts however due to the average investment grade rating and expected default recovery rates actual losses are expected to be less upon a triggering event e g a default with respect to the underlying credit aig markets would normally have the option to settle the position on behalf of the mip through an auction process cash settlement or pay the notional amount of the contract to the counterparty in exchange for a bond issued by the underlying credit physical settlement credit risk related contingent features aig transacts in derivative transactions directly with unaffiliated third parties under isda agreements many of the isda agreements also include csa provisions which provide for collateral postings at various ratings and threshold levels in addition aig attempts to reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable collateral to be obtained from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis the aggregate fair value of aig derivative instruments including those of aigfp that contain credit risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position at september 30 2010 was approximately 6 8 billion the aggregate fair value of assets posted as collateral under these contracts at september 30 2010 was 6 5 billion it is estimated that at september 30 2010 based on aig outstanding financial derivative transactions including those of aigfp at that date a one notch downgrade of aig long term senior debt ratings to baa1 by moody investors service moody and bbb by standard and poor financial services llc a subsidiary of the mcgraw hill companies inc s and p would permit counterparties to make additional collateral calls and permit the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts resulting in up to approximately 1 2 billion of corresponding collateral postings and termination payments a two notch downgrade to baa2 by moody and bbb by s and p would result in approximately 1 2 billion in additional collateral postings and termination payments above the one notch downgrade amount and a three notch downgrade to baa3 by moody and bbb by s and p would result in approximately 0 2 billion in additional collateral postings and termination payments above the two notch downgrade amount additional collateral postings upon downgrade are estimated based on the factors in the individual collateral posting provisions of the csa with each counterparty and current exposure as of september 30 2010 factors considered in estimating the termination payments upon downgrade include current market conditions the complexity of the derivative transactions historical termination experience and other observable market events such as bankruptcy and downgrade events that have occurred at other companies management estimates are also based on the assumption that counterparties will terminate based on their net exposure to aig the actual termination payments could significantly differ from management estimates given market conditions at the time of downgrade and the level of uncertainty in estimating both the number of counterparties who may elect to exercise their right to terminate and the payment that may be triggered in connection with any such exercise hybrid securities with embedded credit derivatives aig has certain investments in synthetic structured securities including certain rmbs cmbs cdos and other abs that contain embedded written credit derivatives these hybrid securities expose aig to risks similar to the risks in other rmbs cmbs cdos and abs but such risk is derived from credit default swaps or similar derivative instruments rather than from direct interests in mortgages and other debt instruments as with other investments in rmbs cmbs cdos and other abs aig invested in these hybrid securities with the intent of generating income and not specifically to acquire exposure to embedded derivative risk the original cash investment made by aig

swaps may be triggered by events such as bankruptcy failure to pay or restructuring associated with the obligations referenced by the derivative and these losses in turn result in the reduction of the

9 percent and 25 9 percent respectively the tax benefit reflected for the three month period ended september 30 2009 attributable to continuing operations was primarily related to changes in the estimated u s tax liability with respect to the potential sale of subsidiaries of 931 million partially offset by an increase of 108 million in the reserve for uncertain tax positions a net increase in the valuation allowance of 405 million and the effect of foreign operations of 122 million the tax benefit reflected in the effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for the nine

purposes during the first quarter of 2010 aig increased its estimate of the aia and alico expected divestiture proceeds following an updated assessment of the range of valuation estimates that considered among other factors the expected proceeds from the sales to prudential plc and metlife announced in that quarter which gave rise to a 910 million reduction in the valuation allowance during the third quarter based on the expectation of lower proceeds from the sale of aia ordinary shares the realization amount of the deferred tax assets was reduced by increasing valuation allowance of 1 3 billion at september 30 2010 and december 31 2009 aig u s consolidated income tax group had net deferred tax assets after valuation allowances of 3 8 billion and 8 6 billion respectively realization of aig net deferred tax asset depends upon its ability to generate gains on asset sales and the initial public offering of aia the sale of alico and tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset however the realization of the net deferred tax asset does not depend on projected future operating income of the u s consolidated income tax group at september 30 2010 and december 31 2009 aig u s consolidated income tax group had deferred tax asset valuation allowances of 19 9 billion and 20 4 billion respectively for the nine months ended september 30 2010 aig recorded a reduction in the u s consolidated income tax group deferred tax asset valuation allowance of 1 2 billion primarily attributable to a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of 175 million related to an increase in the expected gains from the divestiture of alico a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of 4 5 billion related to the total other comprehensive income movement primarily attributable to unrealized appreciation in the available for sale securities portfolio an offsetting increase in the

attractive opportunities to provide liquidity this planned securitization previously supported 589 million of the u s consolidated income tax group deferred tax assets for the nine months ended september 30 2010 386 million of the reduction in valuation allowance was allocated to continuing operations and 791 million was allocated to accumulated other comprehensive income this allocation was based on the primacy of continuing operations which allows for a net reduction in valuation allowance to be attributed to continuing operations to the extent of the related deferred tax expense attributable to continuing operations the reduction is partially offset by 589 million of change in the planned securitization and 525 million related to an expectation of lower proceeds from the aia initial public offering the remaining reduction in valuation allowance was allocated to accumulated other comprehensive income for the three months ended september 30 2010 141 million of the reduction

allowances of 2 6 billion and 3 3 billion respectively related to foreign subsidiaries state and local tax jurisdictions and certain domestic subsidiaries that file separate tax returns the change is

associated with the purchase of additional shares of fuji recorded through purchase accounting at september 30 2010 and december 31 2009 aig had deferred tax assets related to stock compensation of 233 million and 178 million respectively due to aig current stock price these deferred tax assets may not be realizable in the future the accounting guidance for share based payments precludes aig from recognizing an impairment charge on this asset until the related stock awards are exercised vest or expire any charge associated with the deferred tax asset net of valuation allowance is reported in additional paid in capital until the pool of previously recognized tax benefits recorded in additional paid in capital is reduced to zero income tax expense would be recognized for any additional charge aig has a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset related to stock based compensation as of september 30 2010 any reversal of the deferred tax asset due to awards that have been exercised vested or expired is offset by a reversing valuation allowance with no net impact to the aig financial statements accordingly no amount is recorded to additional paid in capital for the shortfall of the current year share based compensation deductions and thus there is no decrease to the pool of previously unrecognized tax benefits recorded in additional paid in capital at both september 30 2010 and december 31 2009 the pool of previously recognized tax benefits recorded in additional paid in capital was 142 6 million accounting for uncertainty in income taxes at september

proceeds will be loaned by aia aurora llc to aig and will be used to repay amounts owing under the frbny credit facility if the transactions contemplated by the recapitalization agreement in principle are not completed aig expects that the net proceeds would instead be used to pay down the liquidation preference of the aia spv preferred interests held by frbny including preferred returns aig expects that unless otherwise agreed with the frbny any excess would then be used to repay any outstanding debt under the frbny credit facility the value of the aia shares that aig will continue to hold following the initial public offering of aia will fluctuate until the ultimate disposition by aig of the aia shares the value of the aia shares will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of aig including the business and financial performance of aia the agreement with the underwriters precludes aig from entering into hedging transactions that might protect aig against fluctuations in the value of its remaining interests in aia while those restrictions are in place alico sale on march 7 2010 aig and alico holdings llc alico spv a special purpose vehicle formed by aig entered into a definitive agreement with metlife for the sale of alico by alico spv to metlife and the sale of delaware american life insurance company by aig to metlife for consideration then valued at approximately 15 5 billion consisting of 6 8 billion in cash and the remainder in equity securities of metlife subject to closing adjustments the alico sale closed on november 1 2010 the fair market value of the consideration at closing was approximately 16 2 billion on the closing date as consideration for the alico sale alico spv received net cash consideration of 7 2 billion which included an upward price adjustment of approximately 400 million pursuant to the terms of the alico stock purchase agreement 78 239 712 shares of metlife common stock 6 857 000 shares of newly issued participating preferred stock convertible into 68 570 000 shares of metlife common stock upon the approval of metlife shareholders and 40 000 000 equity units of metlife with an aggregate stated value of 3 0 billion aig intends to monetize these metlife securities over time subject to market conditions following 112 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries the lapse of agreed upon minimum holding periods aig expects to record a material gain on the transaction in the fourth quarter under the recapitalization net cash proceeds from the alico sale will be held in escrow pending the closing upon the closing of the recapitalization these cash proceeds will be loaned by alico spv to aig and will be used to repay amounts owing under the credit agreement if the recapitalization is not completed aig expects that the cash proceeds would instead be paid to the frbny in its capacity as holder of preferred interests in alico spv to reduce the aggregate outstanding liquidation preference of those preferred interests prior to conversion into metlife common stock the participating preferred stock will be entitled to dividends equivalent on an as converted basis to those that may be declared from time to time on metlife common stock each of the equity units of metlife has an initial stated amount of 75 and consists of an ownership interest in three series of senior debt securities of metlife and three stock purchase contracts with a weighted average life of approximately three years the stock purchase contracts obligate the holder of an equity unit to purchase and obligate metlife to sell a number of shares of metlife common stock that will be determined based on the market price of metlife common stock at the scheduled settlement dates under the stock purchase contracts a minimum of 67 764 000 shares and a maximum of 84 696 000 shares in the aggregate for all equity units subject to anti dilution adjustments the equity units provide for the remarketing of the senior debt securities to fund the purchase price of the metlife common stock they also entitle the holder to receive interest payments on the senior debt securities and deferrable contract payments at a combined rate equal to 5 percent of their stated amount the equity units have been placed in escrow as collateral to secure payments if any in respect of indemnity obligations owed by alico spv to metlife under the alico stock purchase agreement and other transaction agreements the escrow collateral will be released to alico spv over a 30 month period to the extent not used to make indemnity payments or to secure pending indemnity claims submitted by metlife the value of the metlife securities received in the sale of alico will continue to fluctuate until the ultimate monetization by aig of the metlife securities these fluctuations will be influenced by market prices of metlife securities generally and the market prices of metlife common stock in particular which will rise and fall in response to various factors beyond the control of aig including the business and financial performance of metlife aig is subject in each case to agreed upon minimum holding periods that also restrict aig ability to enter into hedging transactions that might protect aig against fluctuations in the value of the securities consideration these minimum holding periods and hedging restrictions cannot be altered without the consent of metlife so aig will bear the risk of these market price fluctuations during the applicable holding periods the amount of any gain or loss recognized by aig upon each sale will depend upon the fair value of the securities consideration received as of closing and the proceeds received by aig from the monetization of the securities this may also result in aig realizing ultimate cash proceeds from the monetization of the securities consideration that are substantially less than what might be expected from the value of such consideration as of the date of the closing of the sale agf sale on august 10 2010 aig entered into a definitive agreement to sell 80 percent of agf for 125 million since aig voting ownership interest in agf will fall below 20 percent agf has been reclassified to discontinued operations as a result of this transaction aig recorded an estimated pre tax loss of

subsidiaries nan shan transaction in the fourth quarter of 2009 aig entered into an agreement to sell its 97 57 percent share of nan shan for approximately 2 15 billion on august 31 2010 the taiwan financial supervisory commission did not approve the sale of nan shan to the purchasers although the sale was not approved by regulatory authorities in taiwan aig is pursuing other opportunities to divest nan shan and believes the proceeds from the sale of this business will approximate the previous sale amount in addition aig believes it will complete the sale of nan shan within 12 months with similar terms and conditions therefore aig continues to classify nan shan as held for sale and as a discontinued operation this is based on management expressed intent to exit the life insurance market in taiwan see notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions sale of interest in transatlantic on march 15 2010 aig closed a secondary

aircraft were recorded in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet and the sales are expected to be completed for most of these aircraft during the remainder of 2010 2010 financial overview aig income from continuing operations before income taxes amounted to 422 million in the third quarter of 2010 an increase of 939 million compared to the same period of 2009 these results reflected the following an improvement in underwriting results for general insurance and mortgage guaranty an improvement of 660 million in asset management pre tax earnings reflecting decreases in impairment charges on proprietary real estate and private equity investments as well as the prior year quarter goodwill impairment charges losses of 885 million on sales of divested businesses recorded in the third quarter of 2009 and a reduction in net realized capital losses of 1 2 billion as discussed in consolidated results net realized capital gains losses these improvements were partially offset by the following a decline of 1 2 billion in financial services pre tax income reflecting a decrease in unrealized market valuation gains on the super senior credit default swap portfolio in capital markets of 807 million as well as ilfc impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of 2010 of 465 million and a decline of 1 2 billion in net investment income primarily driven by lower valuation gains associated with aig interests in maiden lane ii llc ml ii and maiden lane iii llc ml iii together the maiden 114 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries lane interests as well as accelerated amortization of the prepaid commitment fee asset of 762 million in 2010 additionally aig recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of 1 8 billion during the third quarter of 2010 which included a goodwill impairment charge of 1 3 billion related to the sale of aig star and aig edison as well as an estimated pre tax loss of 1 9 billion on the sale of agf consideration of aig ability to continue as a going concern in connection with the preparation of this quarterly report on form 10 q management has assessed whether aig has the ability to continue as a going concern in making this assessment aig has considered the commitment of the u s government to continue to work with aig to maintain its ability to meet its obligations as they come due the execution of the recapitalization agreement in principle aig liquidity related actions and plans to stabilize its businesses and repay the debt outstanding under the frbny credit facility including the recapitalization the additional capital provided or committed through the department of the treasury commitment until completion of the recapitalization the plans to monetize the metlife securities received upon the alico closing the plans to sell the remaining shares in aia the level of aig realized and unrealized losses and the negative impact of these losses in shareholders equity and on the capital levels of aig insurance subsidiaries the continuing liquidity needs in certain of aig businesses and aig actions to address such needs the substantial risks to which aig is subject and aig ability to obtain third party financing and or ability to access capital markets following the recapitalization in considering these items management made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potentially adverse financial and liquidity effects of aig risks and uncertainties management also assessed other items and risks arising in aig businesses and made reasonable judgments and estimates with respect thereto after consideration management believes that it will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate aig businesses and continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months it is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of management plans could be materially different that one or more of management significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of these risks and uncertainties could prove to be materially incorrect and that aig could fail to complete the recapitalization if one or more of these possible outcomes is realized and third party financing and existing liquidity sources including those from the u s government are not sufficient without continued support from the u s government in the future there could exist substantial doubt about aig ability to operate as a going concern see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding going concern considerations 115 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries capital resources and liquidity liquidity overview at september 30 2010 remaining amounts available

aig manages liquidity at both the parent and subsidiary levels aig expects the parent primary uses of available cash will be debt service and subsidiary funding aig expects that dividends distributions and other payments from subsidiaries will support aig parent liquidity needs the frbny credit facility is also expected to continue to be a source of liquidity until the closing of the recapitalization as described more fully above whereby aig intends to fully repay and terminate the frbny credit facility in addition although the department of the treasury commitment may also be used as a source of funding primarily to support the capital needs of aig insurance company subsidiaries aig does not expect to utilize the department of the treasury commitment for this purpose instead aig expects to use the department of the treasury commitment as described under repurchase and exchange of the spv preferred interests under recapitalization above until the closing and unless otherwise agreed with the frbny net proceeds from the sales of operations and assets are expected to be used to repay any outstanding debt under the frbny credit facility after taking into account taxes transaction expenses and capital required to be retained for regulatory or ratings purposes except proceeds from the sale of the metlife securities and the remaining aia shares must be used to reduce the liquidation preference of the spv preferred interests in the event the recapitalization does not close aig expects that the frbny credit facility and the department of the treasury commitment will continue to be available under the existing terms and conditions to support aig parent liquidity needs aig expects that its subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due for at least the next twelve months through cash flows from operations and to the extent necessary maturing investments and asset sales as well as potential debt issuances see further discussion regarding aig liquidity considerations in liquidity of parent and subsidiaries analysis of sources and uses of cash the following table presents selected data from aig consolidated statement of cash flows data table removed net cash provided by operating activities was positive for both the nine months of 2010 and 2009 principally due to continued positive cash flows from aig life insurance subsidiaries insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits but the ability of general insurance operations to generate positive cash flow is affected by operating expenses the frequency and severity of losses under its insurance policies as well as by policy retention rates cash provided by 116 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries general insurance operations was 1 0 billion for the first nine months of 2010 compared to 1 5 billion in the same period in 2009 as a reduction in claims paid was partially offset by declines in premiums collected arising primarily from a decrease in domestic production catastrophic events and significant casualty losses the timing and effect of which are inherently unpredictable reduce operating cash flow for aig general insurance operations cash provided by aig life insurance subsidiaries including entities presented as discontinued operations was 10 1 billion for the first nine months of 2010 compared to 5 7 billion in the same period in 2009 as growth in international markets was partially offset by a decrease in cash flows from domestic operations cash flows provided from financial services including entities presented as discontinued operations were 3 4 billion and 4 2 billion for the nine months ended september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease can be attributed in part to the continued wind down of capital markets businesses and portfolio the capital markets wind down and other segment developments affecting net income described above are further discussed in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accrued compounding interest and fees reflected as non cash expenses were paid in kind in both periods under the provisions of the frbny credit facility and accordingly did not reduce operating cash flow in either period debt under the frbny credit facility includes total accrued compounding interest and fees of 6 2 billion at september 30 2010 the payment of which will be reflected as a reduction in operating cash flows in the period that the accrued compounding interest and fees for the frbny credit facility are paid net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2010 primarily resulted from net purchases of fixed maturity securities due to aig ability to invest cash generated from operating activities and the redeployment of liquidity that had been accumulated by the insurance companies in the 2008 and 2009 time frame in the first nine months of 2009 net cash provided by investing activities resulted from the net proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments net cash used in financing activities was significantly lower in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 primarily as a result of declines in policyholder contract withdrawals reflecting improved

prior payments made by aig to repay the frbny credit facility from asset sales should be treated as mandatory prepayments that reduce the amount available under the frbny credit facility if the frbny takes this position at september 30 2010 this would reduce the amount available to be borrowed under the frbny credit facility by approximately 3 6 billion such reduction in the frbny credit facility

billion of direct investment business debt maturities through september 30 2011 are fully collateralized with assets backing the corresponding liabilities however mismatches in the timing of cash inflows on the assets and outflows with respect to the liabilities may require assets to be sold to satisfy maturing liabilities depending on market conditions and direct investment business ability to sell assets at that time proceeds from sales may not be sufficient to satisfy the full amount due on maturing liabilities any shortfalls would need to be funded by aig parent assets from the mip

further downgrades in aig credit ratings catastrophic losses or a further deterioration in the super senior credit default swap portfolio may result in significant additional cash needs or loss of

addition further downgrades in aig credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of its subsidiaries which could result in non renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary ability to meet its own obligations and require aig to provide capital or liquidity support to the subsidiary increases in market interest rates may adversely

balancing the need for funds with the long term value of holding aircraft and other financing alternatives because the current market for aircraft is depressed due to the economic downturn and limited

example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than

emerging issues such as those related to the u s mortgage and housing market see general insurance results herein for further discussion of net loss development asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded

table presents aig survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at september 30 2010 and 2009 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments in addition aig survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007 these settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at september 30 2010 by approximately 0 2 years and 0 6 years respectively and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at september 30 2009 by approximately 0 8 years and 1 9 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aig determination of its reserves are not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio the

operations would be directly affected following is a discussion of updates to critical accounting estimates during 2010 for a complete discussion of aig accounting estimates see the 2009 annual report on form 10 k goodwill impairment goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred the impairment assessment involves a two step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and if potential impairment is present the amount of impairment is measured if any and recorded impairment is tested at the reporting unit level management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of aig reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units including allocated goodwill the estimate of a reporting unit fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market based earning multiples of the unit peer companies discounted expected future cash flows external appraisals or in the case of reporting units being considered for sale third party indications of fair value if available management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test as part of the impairment test management compares the sum of the estimated fair values of all of aig reporting units with aig market capitalization as a basis for concluding on the reasonableness of the estimated reporting unit fair values if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired the amount of impairment if any is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill the estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination an impairment charge is recognized in earnings to the extent of the excess in connection with the announced sale of alico on march 7 2010 and management decision that alico met the held for sale criteria on march 31 2010 total goodwill of 4 6 billion associated with the foreign life insurance and retirement services japan operating segment through that date was allocated among alico and aig star and aig edison based on their relative fair values as of march 31 2010 this resulted in 3 3 billion and 1 3 billion of goodwill being allocated to alico and the aig star and aig edison reporting units 176 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries respectively for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairment management tested goodwill for impairment in both reporting units and determined the fair values of alico and aig star and aig edison exceeded book value at march 31 2010 by 1 percent and 51 percent respectively and therefore the goodwill of these reporting units was considered not impaired the fair value of alico used to test goodwill for impairment at march 31 2010 was determined by aig by considering among other information a third party valuation at march 31 2010 of the announced proceeds from the sale of alico to metlife given the significance of the equity component of the consideration the fair value of alico is sensitive to the market value and volatility of metlife common stock the risk free interest rate yield curve and discount rate assumptions used in estimating fair value because the market value of metlife common stock declined 13 percent at june 30 2010 compared with march 31 2010 aig updated its goodwill impairment test for alico at june 30 2010 aig estimated the fair value of alico and determined the fair value of alico to be less than its carrying value accordingly aig performed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis and estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill allocated to alico by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of alico over the amounts that would be assigned to alico assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination based on the results of the goodwill impairment test aig determined that all of the goodwill allocated to alico should be impaired and accordingly recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 3 3 billion in the second quarter of 2010 in connection with the announced sale of the aig star and aig edison reporting unit reporting unit on september 29 2010 and management determination that the reporting unit met the held for sale criteria management tested the 1 3 billion of goodwill of the reporting unit for impairment at september 30 2010 aig estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the consideration to be received pursuant to the agreement with prudential financial inc and determined the fair value to be less than its carrying value accordingly aig performed the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis and estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination based on the results of the goodwill impairment test aig determined that all of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit should be impaired and accordingly recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 1 3 billion in the third quarter of 2010 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at september 30 2010 and december 31 2009 aig had a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of 1 3 billion and 5 9 billion respectively a valuation allowance is established if necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized a likelihood of more than 50 percent realization of aig net deferred tax asset depends upon its ability to generate gains on asset sales including from the recently completed initial public offering of aia future sales of aia ordinary shares held by aig and tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset however the realization of the net deferred tax assets does not depend on projected future operating income for aig u s consolidated income tax group when making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax asset at september 30 2010 aig considered all available evidence including the nature frequency and severity of cumulative financial reporting losses certain transactions including the recognition of the gains on asset sales and the initial public offering of aia the carryforward periods for the net operating and capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards and tax planning strategies that would be implemented if necessary to protect against the loss of the deferred tax asset estimates of future gains generated from specific transactions and tax planning strategies could change in the near term perhaps materially which may require aig to adjust its valuation allowance such adjustment either 177 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries positive or negative could be material to aig consolidated financial condition or its results of operations for an individual reporting period when estimating the fair values of the subsidiaries to be divested aig considered among other information valuations prepared for various purposes during the first quarter of 2010 aig increased its estimate of the aia and alico expected divestiture proceeds following an updated assessment of the range of valuation estimates that considered among other factors the expected proceeds from the sales to prudential plc and metlife inc announced in that quarter which gave rise to a 910 million reduction in the valuation allowance during the third quarter based on the expectation of lower proceeds from the sale of aia ordinary shares the realization amount of the deferred tax assets was reduced by increasing valuation allowance of 1 3 billion u s income taxes on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries due to the complexity of the u s federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes related to differences between book carrying value and tax basis of subsidiaries as well as the level of judgment and reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability aig considers the u s federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate measurement of the fair values of the assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of fuji on march 31 2010 aig through a chartis international subsidiary purchased additional voting shares in fuji the acquisition of the additional voting shares for 145 million increased chartis total voting ownership interest in fuji from 41 7 percent to 54 8 percent which resulted in chartis obtaining control of fuji because the acquisition was completed on the last day of the quarter the initial accounting for the acquisition was incomplete when aig issued its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended march 31 2010 the initial purchase price allocation was based on the information that was available at the time to identify and estimate certain of the fair values of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of fuji as of the acquisition date fuji financial information is reported to chartis on a quarter lag as such chartis was awaiting additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date furthermore at the time chartis had not obtained final appraisals of fuji insurance contracts loans certain real estate or intangible assets during the quarter ended june 30 2010 chartis international obtained the additional information necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date including final appraisals of fuji insurance contracts loans certain real estate or intangible assets and retrospectively adjusted the provisional amounts initially recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2010 adjustments to the previously reported purchase price allocation as of march 31 2010 occurred as a result of new information that became known about market conditions in the life insurance industry in japan that existed as of the acquisition date which if known would have reduced the amount recognized by chartis international as of that date for the fair value of the business acquired voba of fuji life insurance subsidiary by approximately 132 million public announcements of capital raising initiatives during this period in response to new regulatory solvency rules announced by the japanese regulator prior to the acquisition date but not yet adopted indicated that market participants are managing to the target solvency margin ratios under the new solvency margin rules instead of the current solvency margin rules as a result chartis international revised its target capital assumption in its voba calculation based on the new standard in addition chartis international increased the previously reported purchase price allocation as of march 31 2010 by approximately 11 million as a result of new information received during the quarter ended september 30 2010 regarding certain assets and liabilities of fuji additional adjustments to the purchase price allocation as of march 31 2010 may occur if new information becomes known about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the amounts recognized as of that date 178 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries the acquisition resulted in a bargain purchase gain of approximately 332 million which is included in other income in the consolidated statement of income loss aig will retrospectively revise its results of operations for the three months ended march 31 2010 when presenting comparative financial information containing that period the bargain purchase gain is primarily attributable to the depressed market value of fuji common stock which aig believes is the result of macro economic capital market and regulatory factors in japan coupled with fuji financial condition and results of operations aig anticipates that the bargain purchase gain will not be subject to u s or foreign income tax because the gain would only be recognized for tax purposes upon the sale of the fuji shares see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities overview the following table

5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the three levels of observability at september 30 2010 aig classified 38 9 billion and 11 2 billion of assets and

december 31 2009 aig classified 38 9 billion and 13 9 billion of assets and liabilities respectively measured at fair value on a recurring basis as level 3 this represented 4 6 percent and 1 9 percent of the total assets and liabilities respectively at december 31 2009 level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable these measurements are made under circumstances in which there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability aig assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment in making the assessment aig considers factors specific to the asset or liability in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of transfers of level 3 assets and liabilities 179 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries valuation of level 3 assets and liabilities aig values its assets and liabilities classified as level 3 using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices and rates yield curves credit curves measures of volatility prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs some of which may be unobservable the following paragraphs describe the methods aig uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the major classes of assets and liabilities classified in level 3 private equity and real estate fund investments these assets initially are valued at the transaction price i e the price paid to acquire the asset subsequently they are measured based on net asset value using information provided by the general partner or manager of these investments the accounts of which generally are audited

private placement debt these assets initially are valued at the transaction price subsequently they are valued using market data for similar instruments e g recent transactions bond spreads or credit default swap spreads when observable price quotations are not available fair value is determined based on cash flow models using yield curves observed from indices or credit default swap spreads

pricing the binomial expansion technique bet model or a combination of these methods interests in the maiden lane interests at their inception ml ii and ml iii were valued at the transaction prices of 1 billion and 5 billion respectively subsequently maiden lane interests are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology that uses the estimated future cash flows of the assets to which the maiden lane interests are entitled and the discount rates applicable to such interests as derived from the fair value of the entire asset pool the implicit discount rates are calibrated to the changes in the estimated asset values for the underlying assets commensurate with aig interests in the capital structure of the respective entities estimated cash flows and discount rates used in the valuations are validated to the extent possible using market observable information for securities with similar asset pools structure and terms the fair value methodology used assumes that the underlying collateral in the maiden lane interests will continue to be held and generate cash flows into the foreseeable future and does not assume a current liquidation of the assets of the maiden lane interests other methodologies employed or assumptions made in determining fair value for these investments could result in amounts that differ significantly from the amounts reported refer to note 5 for sensitivity

notional amount was terminated or matured at no cost to aigfp through october 29 2010 aigfp had also received termination notices with respect to an additional 16 1 billion in net notional amount with an effective termination date in 2010 aigfp continues to reassess the expected maturity of this portfolio as of september 30 2010 aigfp estimated that the weighted average expected maturity of the portfolio was 2 18 years aigfp has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties the regulatory benefit of these transactions for aigfp financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of basel i that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by basel ii it was expected that financial institution counterparties would have transitioned from basel i to basel ii by the end of the two year adoption period on december 31 2009 after which they would have received little or no additional regulatory benefit from these cds transactions except in a small number of specific instances however in 2009 the basel committee announced that it had agreed to keep in place the basel i capital floors beyond the end of 2009 although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various european central banking districts should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame the weighted average expected maturity of the regulatory capital portfolio increased as of september 30 2010 by approximately 0 8 years from december 31 2009 due to certain counterparties not terminating transactions with a combined net notional amount of 16 6 billion where these counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early aigfp has extended the expected maturity dates by one year which is based on how long aigfp believes the basel i extension will be effective where the counterparties no longer have the right to terminate early aigfp has used the weighted average life of those transactions as their expected maturity these counterparties in the corporate loan and prime residential mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits as a result of the extension of the basel i capital floor announced by the basel committee on banking supervision and thus aig continues to categorize them as regulatory capital transactions included in the regulatory capital portfolio are transactions with one counterparty that notified aig that it would not terminate early two of its prime residential mortgage transactions and a related mezzanine transaction with a combined net notional amount of 26 8 billion that were expected to be terminated in the first quarter of 2010 with respect to these transactions the counterparty no longer has any rights to terminate the transactions early and is required to pay aig fees on the original notional amounts reduced only by realized losses through the final contractual maturity since the two transactions have weighted average lives that are considerably less than their final contractual maturities there is value to aigfp representing counterparty contractual fees to be received beyond the date at which the net notional amounts have fully amortized through to the final contractual maturity date the fair value of these two super senior transactions as of september 30 2010 was a derivative asset of 208 million with respect to these two transactions aigfp has also written cds transactions on the mezzanine tranches of these portfolios however the majority of the transactions on the mezzanine tranches were hedged by aigfp with other third party cds transactions in light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data to the extent deemed relevant and available aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the nine month period ended september 30 2010 other than 1 for transactions where aigfp believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above and 2 for transactions where the counterparty has failed to terminate the transaction early as expected and no longer has any rights to terminate early in the future although aigfp believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties the counterparties early termination rights and aigfp expectation that such rights will be exercised preclude the recognition of a derivative asset for these transactions 183 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents

defaults recoveries remaining term property use geography interest rates and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to capital markets for such referenced pools all of the regulatory capital cds transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution or its affiliates receiving the credit protection rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties in the vast majority of transactions the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the cds either directly or through an intermediary as further discussed below aigfp receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets aigfp also obtains other information such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer the nature of the information provided or otherwise available to aigfp with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital cds transaction is not consistent across all transactions furthermore in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions the pools are blind meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to aigfp in addition although aigfp receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools virtually all of the regulatory capital cds transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude aigfp public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets the originating financial institutions calculation agents or trustees each a report provider provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below including for those within the blind pools while much of this information received by aigfp cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information it does provide a sufficient basis for aigfp to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value for regulatory capital cds transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans aigfp receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more report providers

ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available but aigfp estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the report providers to rating agency criteria the percent non investment grade information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the cds transactions which is determined by the individual transaction structures for example small and medium enterprise sme loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large well established enterprises however the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the sme loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools in addition the transaction structures reflect aigfp assessment of the loan collateral arrangements expected recovery values and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss the percentage of non investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably the two pools containing the highest percentages of non investment grade obligations which include all transactions with pools having non investment grade percentages greater than 35 00 percent are all granular sme loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions the average number of loans in each pool is over 4 200 this large number of sme loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool these transactions benefit from a tranche junior to it which was still rated aaa by at least two rating agencies at september 30 2010 three other pools with a total net notional amount of 1 7 billion have non investment grade percentages greater than 185 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries 30 00 percent each with a remaining

2010 collateral most of the capital markets credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes although aigfp has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi sector cdos regulatory capital relief transactions as of september 30 2010 55 2 percent of the capital markets regulatory capital relief transactions measured by net notional amount were subject to credit support annexes csa linked to aig credit rating and 44 8 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions in general each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand alone international swaps and derivatives association inc isda master agreement master agreement or similar agreement under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction the underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty and there is no standard formula the varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties the following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio reference to market indices under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index such as either itraxx or cdx this mechanism is used for cds transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages while the market index is not a direct proxy it has the advantage of being readily obtainable expected loss models under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses generally determined using a rating agency model 191 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries negotiated amount under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between aigfp and the counterparty which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by aigfp the following table presents the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio prior to consideration of transactions other than the capital markets super senior credit default swaps subject to the same master agreements as of the periods ended data table removed arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos in the cds transactions with physical settlement provisions in respect of multi sector cdos the standard csa provisions for the calculation of exposure have been modified with the exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying cdo security rather than the replacement value of the transaction as of any date the market value of the relevant cdo security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such cdo security in a market transaction on such date while the replacement value of the transaction is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation e g the cdo security in cases where a formula is utilized a transaction specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of exposure which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted these thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of aig and or the reference obligations with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings for the large majority of counterparties to these transactions the master agreement and csa cover non cds transactions e g interest rate and cross currency swap transactions as well as cds transactions as a result the amount of collateral to be posted by aigfp in relation to the cds transactions will be added to or offset by the amount if any of the exposure aig has to the counterparty on the non cds transactions arbitrage portfolio corporate debt clos all of the capital markets corporate arbitrage transactions are subject to csas none of these transactions measured by net notional amount contains a special collateral posting provision but each is subject to a master agreement that includes a csa these transactions are treated the same as other transactions subject to the same master agreement and csa with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard csa procedures outlined above none of these transactions although subject to a master agreement and csa has specific valuation and threshold provisions collateral calls aigfp has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps of which a large majority relate to multi sector cdos to a lesser extent aigfp has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage from time to time valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference cdo securities for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by aigfp in connection with such instruments have resulted in estimates that differ at times significantly from aigfp estimates in almost all cases aigfp has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels 192 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements aigfp regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences including at the present time valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are like any other third party valuation considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio the following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions as of the periods ended data table removed the amount of future collateral posting requirements generally is a function of aig credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor while a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined given the severe market disruption lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption aigfp is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future valuation sensitivity arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aig calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average prices for cdos increased 0 90 percent 1 61 percent and 1 45 percent of the notional amount outstanding for the first second and third quarters of 2010 further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the total 6 9 billion net notional amount of cds written on multi sector cdos outstanding at september 30 2010 a bet value is available for 4 2 billion net notional amount no bet value is determined for 2 7 billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 4 2 billion the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities while the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a cdo the changes are subject to actual market 193 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries conditions which have proved to be highly volatile especially given current market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo at this time the following table presents key inputs used in the bet model and the potential increase decrease to the fair value of the derivative liability by abs category at september 30 2010 corresponding to changes in these key inputs data table removed a the diversity score is an input at the cdo level a calculation of sensitivity to this input by type

possible to disclose a weighted average input as a discount curve consists of a series of data points these results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption no assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed perhaps significantly the ranges assumed by aig for purposes of the above analysis no assumption

management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products at the local operating unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at aig consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities in the case of life insurance and retirement services companies as well as in the direct investment business the fundamental investment strategy is as nearly as is practicable to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in the commercial insurance group historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in order to meet the commercial insurance group current risk return and tax objectives the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies liquidity duration and quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives fixed maturity securities held by foreign general insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities the market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components including interest rate environment credit spread embedded optionality such as call features liquidity structural complexity foreign exchange risk and other credit and non credit factors however in most circumstances pricing is most sensitive to interest rates such that the market price declines as interest rates rise and increases as interest rates fall this effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities aig accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value however with limited exceptions primarily with respect to separate account products on aig consolidated balance sheet aig does not fair value its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities and falling interest rates have the opposite effect this results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains losses on securities in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative inverse changes in gains losses on aig liabilities because aig asset duration in certain low yield currencies particularly japan and taiwan is shorter than its liability duration aig views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the market value of its

credit evaluation procedures applied to these and other securities aig considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities current market spreads continue to be significantly wider for securities supported by real estate related assets compared to spreads at the securities respective purchase dates largely due to the continued effects of the

attractive as a class aig believes that the lack of demand for commercial and residential real estate collateral based securities low contractual coupons and interest rate spreads and the deterioration in the level of collateral support due to real estate market conditions are the primary reasons for these securities trading at significant price discounts based 210 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries on its analysis and taking into account the level of subordination below these securities aig continues to believe that the expected cash flows from
