managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is designed to provide the reader a narrative with respect to aigs operations financial condition and liquidity and certain other significant matters index data table removed cautionary statement regarding forward looking information this quarterly report and other publicly available documents may include and aigs officers and representatives may from time to time make statements which may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are not historical facts but instead represent only aigs belief regarding future events many of which by their nature are inherently uncertain and outside of aigs control these statements may address among other things aigs strategy for growth product development regulatory approvals market position financial results and reserves it is possible that aigs actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward looking statements important factors that could cause aigs actual results to differ possibly materially from those in the specific forward looking statements are discussed throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aig is not under any obligation to and expressly disclaims any such obligations to update or alter any forward looking statement whether written or oral that may be made from time to time whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 19 american international group inc and subsidiaries throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aig presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful statutory underwriting profit loss and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance used in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with aigs insurance competitors aig has also incorporated into this discussion a number of parenthetical cross references to additional information included throughout this form 10 q to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject overview aigs operations in 2004 are conducted by its subsidiaries principally through four operating segments general insurance life insurance and retirement services financial services and asset management through these segments aig provided insurance and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in over 130 countries and jurisdictions this geographic product and service diversification is one of aigs major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors although regional economic downturns or political upheaval could negatively impact parts of aigs operations aig believes that this diversification makes it unlikely that regional difficulties would have a material impact on its operating results financial condition or liquidity beginning with the first quarter of 2004 aig reported retirement services results in the same segment as life insurance reflecting the convergence of protective and retirement products and aigs current management of these operations to conform to 2004 presentation 2003 accounts have been restated for further detail see the respective discussions on the results of the life insurance and retirement services and asset management in the operating review herein aigs subsidiaries serve commercial institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network in the united states aig companies are the largest underwriter of commercial and industrial insurance and one of the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well aigs financial services businesses include commercial aircraft leasing capital markets and consumer finance both in the united states and abroad aig also provides asset management services and sells guaranteed investment contracts gics to institutions and individuals aigs 2004 performance reflects implementation of various long term strategies and defined goals in its various operating segments a primary goal of aig in managing its general insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting profit maintaining a combined loss and expense ratio under 100 to achieve this end aig is disciplined in its risk selection and premiums must be adequate to cover the risk accepted aig believes in strict control of expenses so it historically has one of the lowest expense ratios in the industry aig patiently builds relationships in markets around the world where it sees long term growth opportunities for example aigs ability to expand its chinese operations more quickly and extensively than its competitors is the result of relationships developed over nearly 30 years aigs more recent extensions of operations into india brazil russia and other emerging markets follow the same pattern moreover aig believes in investing in the economies and infrastructures of these countries and growing with them when aig companies enter a new jurisdiction they typically offer both basic protection and savings products as the economies evolve aigs products evolve with them to more complex and investment oriented models another central focus of aig operations in current years is the development and expansion of new distribution channels during the third quarter of 2004 aig entered into an agreement with the sumitomo life insurance company sumitomo to market insurance products underwritten by american life insurance company alico in japan sumitomo will initially market alicos cancer insurance coverage through the sumitomo sales channel of approximately 40 000 sales representatives alico and sumitomo have also agreed to consider expanding the relationship to include other insurance products in the future in late 2003 aig entered into an agreement with picc property and casualty company ltd picc which will enable aig companies to market accident and health products throughout china through piccs agency system aig participates in the underwriting results through a reinsurance agreement other examples of new distribution channels used both domestically and overseas include banks affinity groups and e commerce growth for aig may be generated both internally and through acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and offer adequate return on investment in recent years the acquisitions of aig star life insurance co ltd aig star life and aig edison life insurance company aig edison have broadened aigs penetration of the japanese market the second largest for life insurance in the world these acquisitions broadened aigs distribution channels and will result in operating efficiencies as they are integrated into aigs previously existing companies operating in japan aig provides leadership on issues of concern to the global and local economies as well as the insurance and financial services industries in recent years tort reform and legislation to deal with the asbestos problem have been key issues 20 american international group inc and subsidiaries while in prior years trade legislation and superfund have been issues of concern the following table summarizes aigs revenues income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change and net income for the nine months ended september 30 2004 and 2003 data table removed consolidated results the 23 2 percent growth in revenues in the first nine months of 2004 was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from global general insurance operations as well as growth in both general insurance and life insurance and retirement services net investment income and gaap life insurance and retirement services premiums an additional factor in 2004 was the significant decline in aggregate realized capital losses in the first nine months of 2004 compared to the realized capital losses included in the same period of 2003 the decline in realized capital losses in 2004 reflects an improved economy stronger corporate balance sheets and a significantly lower level of impairment loss provisions the realized capital losses in 2003 reflect primarily impairment loss provisions upon the ultimate disposition of these holdings a portion of these losses may be recovered depending on future market conditions aigs income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change increased 28 2 percent in the first nine months of 2004 when compared to the same period of 2003 general insurance and life insurance and retirement services operating income gains together with the decrease in realized capital losses generated the increase over 2003 in both pretax income and net income catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2004 were 814 million pretax and 512 million net of tax and minority interest compared to 73 million pretax and 46 million net of tax and minority interest in the same period of 2003 the following table summarizes the operations of each principal segment for the nine months ended september 30 2004 and 2003 see also note 2 of notes to financial statements data table removed data table removed general insurance aigs general insurance operations provide property and casualty products and services throughout the world the increase in general insurance operating income in the first nine months of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 was primarily attributable to strong growth in operating income with respect to domestic brokerage group operations general insurance operating income in 2004 includes 736 million of catastrophe losses from hurricanes and typhoons compared to 73 million in the same period of 2003 in addition general insurance operations had realized capital gains in 2004 compared to realized capital losses in 2003 life insurance and retirement services aigs life insurance and retirement services operations provide traditional insurance financial and investment products throughout the world aigs foreign operations provide over 50 percent of aigs life insurance and retirement services operating income life insurance and retirement services operating income increased by 35 3 percent in the first nine months of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 this increase resulted from growth in each of aigs principal life insurance and 21 american international group inc and subsidiaries retirement services businesses and the capital gains realized in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized in 2003 financial services aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft leasing capital market transactions consumer finance and insurance premium financing financial services operating income increased in the first nine months of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 the increase occurred because of the growth in consumer finance operating income despite the impact of ilfcs disposition of approximately 2 billion in aircraft through securitizations in the third quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004 and the reduced income from capital markets operations fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of capital markets operations asset management aigs asset management operations provide asset management services and sell gics these products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas asset management operating income increased 50 3 percent in the first nine months of 2004 when compared to the same period of 2003 as a result of the upturn in worldwide financial markets and a strong global product portfolio capital resources at september 30 2004 aig had total shareholders equity of 78 90 billion and total borrowings of 90 21 billion at that date 81 29 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by aig or were matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements gias or matched notes and bonds payable during the period from january 1 2004 through november 5 2004 aig repurchased in the open market 13 310 200 shares of its common stock liquidity at september 30 2004 aigs consolidated invested assets included 16 74 billion in cash and short term investments consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in the first nine months of 2004 amounted to 20 43 billion aig believes that its liquid assets cash provided by operations and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements outlook with respect to overall premium rates in the general insurance business industry pricing has eroded in some classes of business despite this aig believes it will still be able to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new business as a result of aigs broad product line and extensive distribution reach both the domestic brokerage group dbg and the foreign general insurance group are benefitting from the flight to quality aig also continues to be able to modify and limit its contractual obligations by adding appropriate exclusions and policy restrictions aig expects total premiums to increase in 2004 resulting in positive growth in cash flow for investments thus general insurance net investment income is expected to rise in future quarters even in the current low interest rate environment in october 2003 aig entered into an agreement with picc that will enable aig to market its accident and health products through piccs 4 300 branch offices throughout china picc has over 70 percent of the non life market in china and aig expects substantial opportunity for growth through this new distribution channel in the life insurance and retirement services segment aig expects overall continued growth through expansion in china where aig was the first foreign insurance organization to have wholly owned life insurance and retirement services operations in eight major cities aig expects continued growth in india korea and vietnam as well as in the more established japan market where retirement services operations have developed quickly during the third quarter of 2004 aig entered into an agreement with sumitomo to market insurance products underwritten by alico in japan sumitomo will initially market alicos cancer insurance coverage through the sumitomo sales channel of approximately 40 000 sales representatives alico and sumitomo have also agreed to consider expanding the relationship to include other insurance products in the future aig edison life was acquired in august of 2003 aig edison life adds to the current agency force in japan and provides alternative distribution channels including banks financial advisers and corporate and government employee relationships aig edison lifes integration into aigs existing japanese operations will provide future operating efficiencies domestically aig expects continued operating growth in 2004 as distribution channels are expanded and new products are introduced in the airline industry changes in market conditions are not immediately apparent in operating results lease rates have firmed considerably as a result of strong demand spurred by the recovering global commercial aviation market especially in asia sales have begun to increase and aig expects them to be even stronger in future periods therefore aig believes that improvements in that market commencing in 2003 will be gradually reflected in ilfcs results in 2004 in the capital markets operations the integration of aig 22 american international group inc and subsidiaries trading group inc and its subsidiaries aigtg into the operations of aig financial products corp and its subsidiaries aigfp created operating efficiencies that will continue to be realized and product synergies that should enhance 2004 results although quarter to quarter variations are to be expected in this transaction oriented business aig also expects increased contributions to financial services revenues and income from its consumer finance operations consumer finance both domestically as a result of the improving economy and overseas as expansion of credit card operations continues and economic conditions improve aig expects its asset management operations to continue to benefit from the recovery in the equity markets and global economy gics which are sold domestically and abroad to both institutions and individuals are written on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are favorable aig has many promising growth initiatives underway around the world in its insurance and other operations cooperative agreements such as those in russia and with picc and sumitomo are expected to expand distribution networks for aigs products and investment opportunities and provide models for future growth recent developments as previously disclosed in early october aig was advised by the staff of the securities and exchange commission that the staff was considering recommending that the sec bring a civil action against aig and aig financial products corp aigfp alleging violations of the federal securities laws with respect to the marketing and sale by aigfp to public companies of certain products involving structured financial transactions as well as with respect to certain press releases issued by aig which reported the staff notification aig also reported that aigfp had been informed by the u s department of justice that it was a target of an investigation involving possible violations of the federal securities laws with respect to such products on october 21 2004 aig announced that it had been informed by the u s attorney for the southern district of indiana that it was a target of a federal grand jury investigation arising out of a contract between aigs subsidiary national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh pa and brightpoint inc that concerns non traditional insurance or income smoothing products marketed to clients by aig on october 25 2004 aig announced that it intends to seek a resolution of these matters by reaching a prompt settlement on terms satisfactory to the government and aig aig is currently discussing proposed settlement terms with the government but a settlement has not yet been completed as previously disclosed on october 14 2004 the new york state attorney general brought a lawsuit challenging certain insurance brokerage practices related to contingent commissions neither aig nor any of its subsidiaries is a defendant in that action although two employees of an aig subsidiary have pleaded guilty in connection with the attorney generals investigation regulators from several additional states have commenced investigations into the same matters and aig expects there will be additional investigations as well various parties including insureds and shareholders have also asserted putative class action and other claims against aig or its subsidiaries alleging among other things violations of the antitrust and federal securities laws and aig expects that additional claims are likely various federal and state regulatory agencies are reviewing certain other transactions and practices of aig and its subsidiaries in connection with industry wide and other inquiries aig cannot at this time estimate its potential costs related to these matters and accordingly no reserve is being established in aigs financial statements at this time in the opinion of aig management aigs ultimate liability for the matters referred to above is not likely to have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated financial condition although it is possible that the effect would be material to aigs consolidated results of operations for an individual quarterly reporting period on october 11 2004 congress passed the american jobs creation act of 2004 jobs creation act and president bush signed the bill into law on october 22 2004 the jobs creation act includes a number of provisions that are expected to affect current business practices for example the jobs creation act creates a temporary incentive for u s multinationals to repatriate certain accumulated income earned abroad by providing a special 85 percent dividends received deduction subject to specific reinvestment and repatriation guidelines and certain limitations companies may elect to take the temporary deduction in 2004 or 2005 aig believes that the impact of the jobs creation act on its results of operations and financial condition will not be significant critical accounting estimates aig considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts deferred policy acquisition costs and fair value determinations for certain capital markets assets and liabilities these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used aigs results of operations would be directly impacted throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aigs critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail the major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to 23 american international group inc and subsidiaries establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below reserves for losses and loss expenses general insurance data table removed future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts life insurance and retirement services interest rates which vary by territory year of issuance and products mortality morbidity and surrender rates based upon actual experience by geographical region modified to allow for variation in policy form deferred policy acquisition costs general insurance recoverability based upon the current profitability of the underlying insurance contracts life insurance and retirement services estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated duration of the contracts nontraditional life estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less required interest actual mortality and other expenses fair value determinations of certain assets and liabilities financial services capital markets valuation models utilizing factors such as market liquidity and current interest foreign exchange and volatility rates aig attempts to secure reliable and independent current market price data such as published exchange rates from external subscription services such as bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available aig uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the transactions operating review general insurance operations aigs general insurance subsidiaries are multiple line companies writing substantially all lines of property and casualty insurance both domestically and abroad domestic general insurance operations are comprised of dbg which includes the hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company hsb transatlantic holdings inc transatlantic personal lines including 21st century insurance group 21st century and united guaranty corporation mortgage guaranty dbg is aigs primary domestic general division dbg writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers this provides dbg the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control any licensed broker is able to submit business to dbg without the traditional agent company contractual relationship but such broker usually has no authority to commit dbg to accept a risk transatlantic offers through its reinsurance company subsidiaries reinsurance capacity both domestically and overseas on a treaty and facultative basis for a full range of property and casualty products personal lines engages in the mass marketing of personal lines insurance primarily private passenger auto and personal umbrella coverages as well as providing comprehensive insurance coverage to high net worth households through its private client group mortgage guaranty provides guaranty insurance to mortgage providers primarily with respect to conventional first mortgage loans on single family dwellings and condominiums during 2003 mortgage guaranty commenced providing guaranty insurance to providers of student loans aigs foreign general insurance group accepts risks primarily underwritten through aiu a marketing unit consisting of wholly owned agencies and insurance entities the foreign general insurance group also includes business written by aigs foreign based insurance subsidiaries for their own accounts see also note 2 of notes to financial statements as previously noted aig believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its investors accordingly in its general insurance business aig uses certain non gaap measures where aig has determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful a critical discipline of a successful general insurance business is the objective to produce operating income from underwriting exclusive of investment related income when underwriting is not profitable premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses and underwriting related expenses in these situations the addition of general insurance related investment income and realized capital gains may however enable a general insurance business to produce operating income if underwriting losses persist over extended periods an insurance company will likely not continue to exist as a going concern for these reasons aig views underwriting profit to be critical in the overall evaluation of performance although in and of itself not a gaap measurement aig believes this 24 american international group inc and subsidiaries measurement is a useful and meaningful disclosure see also the discussion under liquidity herein general insurance operating income is comprised of underwriting profit net investment income and realized capital gains and losses these components as well as net premiums written net premiums earned and statutory ratios for the nine months ending september 30 2004 and 2003 were as follows data table removed a catastrophe losses for the first nine months of 2004 by segment were dbg 406 million personal lines 25 million transatlantic 165 million and foreign general 140 million catastrophe losses for the first nine months of 2003 by segment were dbg 48 million personal lines 5 million transatlantic 4 million and foreign general 16 million b the impact of catastrophe losses on the loss ratio was an increase of 2 53 in 2004 and 0 31 in 2003 general insurance results net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized in income as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period dbg has maintained a disciplined approach to pricing and risk selection and chose not to renew approximately 207 million in premiums in the third quarter of 2004 where pricing terms and conditions or loss experience did not meet underwriting standards like all aig companies dbg is benefiting from the flight to quality a strong profit center focus and growing distribution channels overall dbgs net premiums written increased in the first nine months of 2004 over 2003 aig believes that moderate premium rate increases will continue in 2004 particularly with respect to long tail lines of business where the insurers stability is critical to the insured based on historical patterns aig believes that overall growth in net premiums written will slow as competition for premiums increases in certain lines of business transatlantic net premiums written increased as a result of growth in its international business personal lines net premiums written in the first nine months of 2004 include 301 million from the domestic insurance operations of ge that were acquired in august of 2003 the increase in net premiums written apart from this acquisition resulted from increased marketing efforts as well as rate increases in several states the increase in underwriting profits in the first nine months of 2004 when compared to the same period of 2003 resulted from premium rate increases and growth in net premiums written and earned underwriting profits are expected to continue to increase through 2004 as a result of continued marketing efforts loss cost stabilization and the full year impact of the acquisition mortgage guaranty net premiums written increased 16 1 percent in the first nine months of 2004 when compared to the same period of 2003 premiums grew and refinancings declined as interest rates rose this growth was offset by a slight increase in the delinquency ratio which is still below the industry average ugc is moving forward with plans to enter new markets around the world foreign general insurance net premiums written growth was due to premium rate increases as well as flight to quality every major region of the worldwide network contributed to this performance the far east region had excellent growth in japan corporate and personal accident business expanded commercial lines in europe continue to exhibit strong growth as did aigs personal lines operations in brazil and 25 american international group inc and subsidiaries latin america additionally aigs joint venture in india has expanded its commercial lines leadership among the private sector companies in comparing the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the results of aigs foreign general operations during the first nine months of 2004 to those foreign currency exchange rates used to translate aigs foreign general results during the same period of 2003 the u s dollar weakened slightly in value in relation to most major foreign currencies in which aig transacts business accordingly when foreign net premiums written were translated into u s dollars for the purposes of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements total general insurance net premiums written were approximately 2 3 percentage points more than they would have been if translated utilizing those foreign currency exchange rates which prevailed during the same period of 2003 aig along with most general insurance entities uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of performance the loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss underwriting profit is measured in two ways statutory underwriting profit and generally accepted accounting principles gaap underwriting profit statutory underwriting profit is arrived at by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting generally requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes expenses are recognized immediately not over the same period that the revenues are earned a basic premise of gaap accounting is the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the accounting principle of matching therefore to convert underwriting results to a gaap basis acquisition expenses are deferred deferred policy acquisition costs dac and amortized over the period the related net premiums written are earned accordingly the statutory underwriting profit has been adjusted as a result of acquisition expenses being deferred as required by gaap dac is reviewed for recoverability and such review requires management judgment see also critical accounting estimates herein the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity regulation product type and competition have a direct impact on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios aigs general insurance results reflect the impact of incurred losses from catastrophes of 736 million and 73 million in the first nine months and third quarter of 2004 and 2003 respectively the impact of losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult with respect to catastrophe losses aig believes that it has taken appropriate steps such as careful exposure selection and obtaining reinsurance coverage to reduce the impact of the magnitude of possible future losses the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity such as a terrorist attack earthquake or hurricane that causes insured losses however could have a material adverse effect on aigs results of operations liquidity or financial condition general insurance net investment income grew in the first nine months of 2004 when compared to the same period of 2003 aig is benefiting from the strong cash flow of the past two years higher interest rates dividend income and good private equity results see also the discussion under liquidity herein realized capital gains and losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the general insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations the realized capital gains in the first nine months of 2004 reflect an improved economy stronger corporate balance sheets and a significantly lower level of impairments the realized capital losses in the first nine months of 2003 reflect primarily impairment loss provisions for both equity and fixed income holdings see the discussion on valuation of invested assets herein the increase in general insurance operating income in the first nine months of 2004 was primarily attributable to strong profitable growth in dbg operations the improvement in net investment income and the capital gains realized in 2004 rather than the capital losses realized in 2003 the contribution of general insurance operating income to aigs consolidated income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change was 31 7 percent in the first nine months of 2004 compared to 36 5 percent in the same period of 2003 the decrease in contribution percentage in 2004 was influenced by the impact of the catastrophe losses reinsurance aig is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations aig is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance pro 26 american international group inc and subsidiaries grams aig insures risks globally and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide aig the level of reinsurance protection that aig desires aig purchases reinsurance to mitigate its catastrophic exposure however one or more catastrophe losses could negatively impact aigs reinsurers and result in an inability of aig to collect reinsurance recoverables aigs reinsurance department evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of state of the art industry recognized program models among other techniques aig supplements these models through continually monitoring the risk exposure of aigs worldwide general insurance operations and adjusting such models accordingly while reinsurance arrangements do not relieve aig from its direct obligations to its insureds an efficient and effective reinsurance program substantially limits aigs probable losses aigs consolidated general reinsurance assets amounted to 25 44 billion at september 30 2004 and resulted from aigs reinsurance arrangements thus a credit exposure existed at september 30 2004 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse aig under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements aig manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and when necessary aig holds substantial collateral in the form of funds securities and or irrevocable letters of credit this collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis at december 31 2003 approximately 47 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers in order to obtain statutory recognition the majority of these balances were collateralized the remaining 53 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from authorized reinsurers the terms authorized and unauthorized pertain to regulatory categories not creditworthiness approximately 90 percent of the balances with respect to authorized reinsurers are from reinsurers rated a excellent or better as rated by a m best or a strong or better as rated by standard and poors through september 30 2004 these distribution percentages have not changed significantly this rating is a measure of financial strength aig maintains an allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance and has been largely successful in its previous recovery efforts aigs allowance for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance approximated 140 million as of september 30 2004 at that date aig had no significant reinsurance recoverables from any individual reinsurer which is financially troubled e g liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction aigs reinsurance security department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic such assessments include but are not limited to identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity and the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates this department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for collateral for example in aigs treaty reinsurance contracts aig includes credit triggers that require a reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced event occurs such credit triggers include but are not limited to insurer financial strength rating downgrades policyholder surplus declines at or below a certain predetermined level or a certain predetermined level of a reinsurance recoverable being reached in addition aigs credit risk committee reviews the credit limits for and concentrations with any one reinsurer aig enters into certain intercompany reinsurance transactions for its general and life operations aig enters these transactions as a sound and prudent business practice in order to maintain underwriting control and spread insurance risk among various legal entities these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation at september 30 2004 the consolidated general reinsurance assets of 25 44 billion include reinsurance recoverables for paid losses and loss expenses of 3 22 billion and 18 33 billion with respect to the ceded reserve for losses and loss expenses including ceded losses incurred but not reported ibnr ceded reserves the ceded reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate ceded losses including provisions for ceded ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting ceded reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management any adjustments thereto are reflected in income currently it is aigs belief that the ceded reserves at september 30 2004 were representative of the ultimate losses recoverable in the future as the ceded reserves continue to develop to ultimate amounts the ultimate loss recoverable may be greater or less than the reserves currently ceded 27 american international group inc and subsidiaries reserve for losses and loss expenses the table below classifies as of september 30 2004 the components of the general insurance reserve for losses and loss expenses loss reserves with respect to major lines of business on a statutory basis data table removed presented pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners these loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including ibnr and loss expenses at september 30 2004 general insurance net loss reserves increased 7 17 billion from the prior year end to 43 82 billion in the first nine months of 2004 net adverse reported loss development for the prior accident years was estimated to be approximately 700 million the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently it is managements belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover all general insurance net losses and loss expenses as of september 30 2004 while aig annually reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not adversely develop and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of september 30 2004 in the future if the general insurance net loss reserves develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations in a very broad sense the general insurance loss reserves can be categorized into two distinct groups one group being long tail casualty lines of business such lines include excess and umbrella liability directors and officers liability professional liability medical malpractice general liability products liability and related classes the other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines for operations writing short tail coverages such as property coverages the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes is geared toward maintaining an appropriate reserve level for the outstanding exposure rather than determining an expected loss ratio for current business for example the ibnr reserve required for a class of property business might be expected to approximate 20 percent of the latest years earned premiums and this level of reserve would be maintained regardless of the loss ratio emerging in the current quarter the 20 percent factor is adjusted to reflect changes in rate levels loss reporting patterns known exposures to large unreported losses or other factors affecting the particular class of business estimation of ultimate net losses and loss expenses net losses for long tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors including the line and volume of the business involved experience in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty lines shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses that is a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and an even smaller proportion would be net losses paid a relatively high proportion of net losses would therefore be ibnr aigs carried net long tail loss reserves are tested using loss trend factors that aig considers most appropriate for each class of business a variety of actuarial methods and assumptions are normally employed to estimate net losses for long tail casualty lines these methods ordinarily involve the use of loss trend factors intended to reflect the estimated annual growth in loss costs from one accident year to the next for the majority of long tail casualty lines net loss trend factors approximated six percent loss trend factors reflect many items including changes in claims handling exposure and policy forms current and future estimates of monetary inflation and social inflation and increases in litigation and awards these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted as appropriate to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience thus many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the year to year growth in loss costs recognized a number of actuarial assumptions are made in the review of reserves for each line of business for longer tail lines of business actuarial assumptions generally are made with respect to the following loss trend factors which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratio for prior accident years expected loss ratios for the latest accident year i e accident year 2003 for the year end 2003 loss reserve analysis and in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years adjusted for the loss trend see above and the impact of rate changes and other quantifiable factors for low frequency high severity classes such as excess casualty and directors and officers liability d and o expected loss ratios generally are utilized for at least the three most recent accident years 28 american international group inc and subsidiaries loss development factors which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis aig records quarterly changes in loss reserves for each of its many general insurance profit centers the overall change in aigs loss reserves is based on the sum of these profit center level changes for most profit centers which write longer tail classes of casualty coverage the process of recording quarterly loss reserve changes involves determining the estimated current loss ratio for each class of coverage this loss ratio is multiplied by the current quarters net earned premium for that class of coverage to determine the quarters total estimated net incurred loss and loss expense the change in loss reserves for the quarter for each class is thus the difference between the net incurred loss and loss expense estimated as described above and the net paid losses and loss expenses in the quarter the process of determining the current loss ratio for each class or business segment begins in the profit centers in the latter part of the previous year the loss ratios determined for each profit center are based on a variety of factors these include but are not limited to the following considerations prior accident year and policy year loss ratios actual and anticipated rate changes actual and anticipated changes in coverage reinsurance or mix of business actual and anticipated changes in external factors impacting results such as trends in loss costs or in the legal and claims environment each profit centers loss ratio for the following year is subject to review by the profit centers management by actuarial and accounting staffs and ultimately by senior management at the close of each quarter the assumptions underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine if the loss ratios based thereon remain appropriate this process includes a review of the actual claims experience in the quarter actual rate changes achieved actual changes in coverage reinsurance or mix of business and changes in certain other factors that may affect the loss ratio when this review suggests that the initially determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate the loss ratio for current business would be changed to reflect the revised assumptions a comprehensive annual loss reserve review is conducted in the fourth quarter of each year for each aig general insurance subsidiary these reviews are conducted in full detail for each class or line of business for each subsidiary and thus consist of literally hundreds of individual analyses the purpose of these reviews is to confirm the reasonableness of the reserves carried by each of the individual subsidiaries and thereby of aigs overall carried reserves the reserve analysis for each business class is performed by the actuarial personnel who are most familiar with that class of business in completing these detailed actuarial reserve analyses the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions including for example the selection of loss development factors and loss cost trend factors they are also required to determine and select the most appropriate actuarial method s to employ for each business class additionally they must determine the appropriate segmentation of data or segments from which the adequacy of the reserves can be most accurately tested in the course of these detailed reserve reviews for each business segment a point estimate of the loss reserve is generally determined the sum of these point estimates for each of the individual business classes for each subsidiary provides an overall actuarial point estimate of the loss reserve for that subsidiary the overall actuarial point estimate is compared to the subsidiarys carried loss reserve if the carried reserve can be supported by actuarial methods and assumptions which are also believed to be reasonable then the carried reserve would generally be considered reasonable and no adjustment would be considered the ultimate process by which the actual carried reserves are determined considers not only the actuarial point estimate but a myriad of other factors other crucial internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions in the united states and abroad changes in the legal regulatory judicial and social environments underlying policy pricing terms and conditions and claims handling with respect to the 2003 year end actuarial loss reserve analysis for dbg the actuaries continued to utilize the modified assumptions which gave additional weight to actual loss development from the more recent years as identified during the 2002 analysis with appropriate adjustments to account for the additional year of loss experience which emerged in 2003 although the actuaries continued to use actuarial assumptions that rely on expected loss ratios based on the results of prior accident years the expected loss ratio assumptions used gave far greater weight to the more recent accident year experience than was the case in the prior year end assumptions no weight was given to the more favorable experience of accident years prior to 1997 additionally the actuaries modified their loss cost trend assumptions to reflect the emerging experience from the recent accident years for example in setting the expected loss ratios for accident years 2001 2002 and 2003 for the excess casualty lead umbrella class the actuaries gave 100 percent weight to the results of the 1997 through 2000 accident years only giving no weight to the more favorable development of accident years prior to 1997 in addition they continued to utilize the 7 5 percent annual loss cost trend factor loss development trends for long tail lines such as excess casualty and d and o however have not followed any consistent trend this has at times led to overstated loss ratio projections and is a key reason why the actuaries have customarily utilized the historical projection method which gave more weight to the experience of older more mature accident years for long tail lines judgment is required in analyzing the appropriate weighting of current trends to avoid overreacting to data anomalies that may distort such current trends given the accuracy of the historical approach and the uncertainty of the more recent trends aig management decided to give approximately equal weight to the point estimate of the required reserve resulting from the historical 29 american international group inc and subsidiaries assumptions and the point estimate of the required reserve from the modified assumptions described above in determining the actual loss reserve carried at year end 2003 aig does not believe disclosure of specific point estimates calculated by the actuaries would be meaningful as described more fully below considerable judgment is required in evaluating loss trends and developments for all classes of business particularly long tailed lines any one actuarial point estimate is based on a particular series of judgments and assumptions of the actuary another actuary may give different weights or make different assumptions and therefore reach a different point estimate so long as the series of judgments and assumptions are reasonable no one such point estimate is necessarily a better estimate than another point estimate point estimates are used to independently re affirm the reasonableness of the overall carried reserves thus provided the actuaries confirm the overall reasonableness of aigs loss and loss expense liabilities aig believes that disclosure of such point estimates would not be helpful and in fact could potentially be misleading nevertheless in the interest of comprehensive disclosure but taking into consideration the reservations aig management has expressed with respect to the meaningfulness of disclosure of point estimates the actual loss reserve carried at year end 2003 for aigs overall general insurance business was approximately 4 percent greater than the aggregate reserve indicated by the actuarial point estimates including the historical assumptions as described above and was approximately 2 percent less than the aggregate reserve indicated by the actuarial point estimates utilizing the modified assumptions aigs annual loss reserve does not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates because aigs general insurance business is primarily in long tail casualty lines driven almost entirely by severity rather than frequency of claims developing a range around loss reserve estimates would not be meaningful an estimate is calculated which aigs actuaries believe provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve this amount is evaluated against actual carried reserves there is a potential for significant variation in the developing loss reserves particularly for long tail classes of business such as excess casualty when actual costs differ from the assumptions used to test the reserves for the excess casualty class of business a 5 percent change in the assumed loss cost trend from each accident year to the next would cause approximately a 400 million impact either positively or negatively to the net loss and loss expense reserve for this business for the d and o and related management liability classes of business a 5 percent change in the assumed loss cost trend would also cause approximately a 400 million impact either positively or negatively to the net loss and loss expense reserve for such business for healthcare liability business including hospitals and other healthcare exposures the 5 percent change in the assumed loss cost trend would cause approximately a 100 million impact either positively or negatively to the loss and loss expense reserve for this business actual loss cost trends in the early 1990s were negative for these classes whereas in the late 1990s loss costs trends ran well into the double digits for each of these three classes the sharp increase in loss costs in the late 1990s was thus much greater than the 5 percent changes cited above and caused significant increases in the overall loss reserve needs for these classes while changes in the loss cost trend assumptions can result in a significant impact on the reserve needs for other smaller classes of liability business the potential impact of these changes on aigs overall carried reserves would be much less than for the classes noted above for the excess casualty class if future loss development factors differed by 5 percent from those utilized in the year end 2003 loss reserve review there would be approximately a 400 million impact on the overall aig loss reserve position the comparable impact on the d and o and related management liability classes would be approximately 200 million if future loss development factors differed by 5 percent from those utilized in the year end 2003 loss reserve review for healthcare liability classes the impact would be approximately 100 million for workers compensation reserves the impact of a 5 percent deviation from the loss development factors utilized in the year end 2003 reserve reviews would be approximately 600 million either positively or negatively because loss development factors for this class have shown less volatility than higher severity classes such as excess casualty however actual changes in loss development factors are expected to be less than 5 percent there is some degree of volatility in loss development patterns for other longer tail liability classes as well however the potential impact on aigs reserves would be much less than for the classes cited above aig management believes that using a 5 percent change in the assumptions for loss cost trends and loss development factors provides a reasonable estimate of the impact on the reserves of a common or normal potential deviation for aigs most significant lines of general insurance business for excess casualty business both the loss cost trend and the loss development factor assumptions are critical generally actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development however there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past moreover as excess casualty is a long tail class of business any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year thus there is the potential for the reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly impacted by changes in the loss cost trends or loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves these changes in loss trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment or in other social or economic 30 american international group inc and subsidiaries phenomena impacting claims for example during the lengthy periods during which losses develop for excess casualty actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the next have ranged from negative values to double digit amounts thus the 5 percent sensitivity indicator is considered an appropriate estimate of a common or normal deviation for excess casualty likewise in the judgment of aigs actuaries an annual 5 percent potential deviation in loss development factors is reasonable based upon historical development for d and o and related management liability classes of business the loss cost trend assumption is critical the loss development factor assumption is important but less critical than for excess casualty as this coverage is written on a claims made basis claims for a given accident year are all reported within that year therefore the potential for significantly unusual loss development patterns generally exists only for several years actual changes in loss costs from one accident year to the next in the 1990s ranged from negative values to double digit amounts thus the 5 percent sensitivity indicator is a reasonable estimate of a common or normal potential deviation a 5 percent deviation in loss development factors is also considered reasonable for these classes however as noted above the dollar impact of such a deviation is less than that of a similar deviation in loss cost trends for healthcare liability classes both the loss cost trend and the loss development factor assumptions are critical the nature of the potential volatility would be analogous to that described above for the excess casualty business however aigs volume of business in the healthcare classes is much smaller than for excess casualty hence the potential dollar impact on aigs overall reserves is smaller for these classes than for excess casualty aigs healthcare liability business includes both primary and excess exposures for workers compensation the loss development factor assumptions are important generally aigs actual historical workers compensation loss development would be expected to provide a reasonably accurate predictor of future loss development a 5 percent sensitivity indicator for workers compensation would thus be considered to be toward the high end of potential deviations for this class of business aigs workers compensation reserves include a small portion relating to excess workers compensation coverage the analysis applicable to excess casualty would apply to these reserves however the volume of such business is de minimis compared to that for excess casualty the loss cost trend assumption for workers compensation is not believed to be material with respect to aigs loss reserves other than for that portion representing excess workers compensation this is primarily because aigs actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident years reserves so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for workers compensation business for casualty business other than the classes noted above there is generally some potential for deviation in both the loss cost trend and loss development factor selections however the impact of such deviations would not be material when compared to the impact cited above for excess casualty and directors and officers liability asbestos and environmental reserves aig continues to receive claims asserting injuries from toxic waste hazardous substances and other environmental pollutants and alleged damages to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites referred to collectively as environmental claims and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental claims emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years commencing in 1985 standard policies contained an absolute exclusion for pollution related damage and an absolute asbestos exclusion was also implemented however aig currently underwrites environmental impairment liability insurance on a claims made basis and has excluded such claims from the analysis herein the majority of aigs exposures for asbestos and environmental claims are excess casualty coverages not primary coverages thus the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity reserves that is litigation expenses are included within the limits of the liability aig incurs individual significant claim liabilities where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable are established on a case basis estimation of asbestos and environmental claims loss reserves is a complex process these asbestos and environmental claims cannot be estimated by aig using conventional reserving techniques as previously described significant factors which affect the trends that influence the asbestos and environmental claims estimation process are the inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations which broaden the intent of the policies and scope of coverage the current case law can be characterized as still evolving and there is little likelihood that any firm direction will develop in the near future additionally the exposure for cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites involve issues such as allocation of responsibility among potentially responsible parties and the governments refusal to release parties due to this uncertainty it is not possible to determine the future development of asbestos and environmental claims with the same degree of reliability as is with other types of claims such future development will be affected by the extent to which courts continue to expand the intent of the policies and the scope of the coverage as they have in the past as well as by the changes in superfund and waste dump site coverage issues aig and other industry members will continue to litigate the broadening judicial interpretation of the policy coverage and the liability issues although the estimated liabilities with respect to asbestos and environmental reserves are subject to a significantly 31 american international group inc and subsidiaries greater margin of error than for other loss reserves the asbestos and environmental reserves carried at the balance sheet date are believed to be adequate as these reserves are based on the known facts and current law furthermore as aigs net exposure retained relative to the gross exposure written was lower in 1984 and prior years the potential impact of these claims is much smaller on the net loss reserves than on the gross loss reserves however if the asbestos and environmental reserves develop deficiently such deficiency would have an adverse impact on future results of operations see the previous discussion on reinsurance collectibility herein aig does not discount its asbestos and environmental reserves with respect to known asbestos and environmental claims aig established over a decade ago specialized toxic tort and environmental claims units which investigate and adjust all such asbestos and environmental claims these units evaluate these asbestos and environmental claims utilizing a comprehensive ground up approach on a claim by claim basis the asbestos and environmental claims are reserved to ultimate probable loss based upon known facts current law jurisdiction policy language and other factors each claim is reviewed at least semi annually utilizing the aforementioned approach and adjusted as necessary to reflect the current information in both the specialized and dedicated asbestos and environmental claims units aig actively manages and pursues early settlement with respect to these claims thereby reducing its exposure to the unpredictable development of these claims with respect to asbestos claims reserves aig has resolved all claims with respect to miners and major manufacturers tier 1 and payments have been completed or reserves are established to cover future payment obligations asbestos claims with respect to products containing asbestos tier 2 are generally very mature losses and have been appropriately recognized and reserved by aigs asbestos claims operation aig believes that the vast majority of the incoming claims with respect to products containing small amounts of asbestos companies in the distribution chain and parties with remote ill defined involvement with asbestos tier 3 and 4 should not impact its coverage this is due to a combination of factors including peripheral companies increasingly being named in asbestos litigation smaller limits issued to peripheral defendants tenuous liability cases against peripheral defendants attachment points of the excess policies and the manner in which resolution of these weaker cases would be allocated among all insurers including non aig companies over a long period of time aig believes the majority of its known long tail environmental exposures have been resolved utilizing a combination of pro active claim handling techniques including policy buybacks complete environmental releases compromise settlements and where indicated litigation current and new claims are generally cases of declining severity strong coverage defenses including late notice and stronger liability defenses are among the factors contributing to declining severity in order to test the overall reasonableness of the asbestos and environmental reserves established using the ground up approach aig uses primarily two methods the market share method and the frequency severity method the market share method produces indicated asbestos and environmental reserves needs by applying the appropriate aig company market share to estimated potential industry ultimate loss and loss expenses based on the latest estimates from a m best and tillinghast the second method the frequency severity approach utilizes current information as the basis of an analysis that predicts for each of the next ten years a number with respect to future expected environmental claims and the average severity of each the estimated trend in frequency is based upon assumptions judged by aig to be the most reasonable the trend in severity starts with severities based on current actual average severity using the varying case adequacy assumptions and trending forward under assumptions deemed most reasonable by aig a similar frequency severity analysis is also performed for asbestos however future asbestos claims ibnr are projected for each of the next twenty years aigs net carried asbestos and environmental reserves are approximately 25 million greater than the mean indication of the reserves calculated using the market share method and approximately 50 million less than the median indication of the reserves calculated using the frequency severity approach to test the reserves thus based on these alternative tests aig deems its carried reserves to be reasonable as of december 31 2003 quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective consideration including managerial judgment to assure management satisfaction that the overall reserves are adequate to meet projected losses 32 american international group inc and subsidiaries a summary of

rating agency has developed a survival ratio to measure the number of years it would take a company to exhaust both its asbestos and environmental reserves for losses and loss expenses based on that companys current level of asbestos and environmental claims payments this is a ratio derived by taking the current ending losses and loss expense reserves and dividing by the average annual payments for the prior three years therefore the ratio derived is a simplistic measure of an estimate of the number of years it would be before the current ending losses and loss expense reserves would be paid off using recent average payments the higher the ratio the more years the reserves for losses and loss expenses cover these claims payments these ratios are computed based on the ending reserves for losses and loss expenses over the respective claims settlement during the fiscal year such payments include indemnity payments and legal and loss adjustment payments it should be noted however that this is an extremely simplistic approach to measuring asbestos and environmental reserve levels many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant impact on the amount of asbestos and environmental losses and loss expense reserves ultimate payments made and the resultant ratio aig believes that voluntary payments with respect to environmental claims should be excluded from the calculation of the survival ratio for the environmental claims that is involuntary payments are primarily attributable to court judgments court orders covered claims with no coverage defenses state mandated clean up costs claims where aigs coverage defenses are minimal and settlements that are made less than six months before the first trial setting payments other than these are deemed voluntary because aig can control the amount and timing of such payments if any 33 american international group inc and subsidiaries aigs survival ratios

insurance and retirement services investment portfolios are managed within the overall objectives of the life insurance and retirement services operations the decline in the realized capital losses in the first nine months of 2004 reflect an improved economy stronger corporate balance sheets and a significantly lower level of impairments the realized capital losses in the first nine months of 2003 reflect impairment loss provisions for certain equity and fixed income holdings see also the discussion on valuation of invested assets herein underwriting and investment risk the risks associated with the traditional life and accident and health products are underwriting risk and investment risk the risk associated with the financial and investment contract products is primarily investment risk underwriting risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality morbidity termination and expenses the emergence of significant adverse experience would require an adjustment to the benefit reserves that could have a substantial impact with respect to aigs results of operations aigs foreign life companies limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to approximately 1 5 million of coverage and aigs domestic life companies generally limit their maximum underwriting exposure on traditional life insurance of a single life to 2 5 million of coverage by using yearly renewable term reinsurance see also the discussion under liquidity herein the investment risk represents the exposure to loss resulting from the cash flows from the invested assets primarily long term fixed rate investments being less than the cash flows required to meet the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments see also the discussion under liquidity herein to minimize its exposure to investment risk aig tests the cash flows from the invested assets and the policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to assess whether there is a liquidity excess or deficit if a rebalancing of the invested assets to the policy and contract claims became necessary and did not occur a demand could be placed upon liquidity see also the discussion under liquidity herein the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs foreign operations as it has been throughout aigs history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or there are investment restrictions imposed by the local regulatory authorities for example in japan and several southeast asia territories the duration of the investments is often for a shorter period than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is a risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities additionally there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities constant management focus is required to reinvest the proceeds of the maturing securities and to invest the future premium receipts while continuing to maintain satisfactory investment quality to the extent permitted under local regulation aig may invest in qualified longer term securities outside japan to achieve a closer matching in both duration and the required yield aig is able to manage any asset liability duration difference through maintenance of sufficient global liquidity and to support any operational shortfall through its international financial network see also the discussion under liquidity herein certain foreign jurisdictions have limited long dated bond markets and aig may use alternative investments including equities and foreign denominated fixed income instruments to extend the effective duration of the investment portfolio to more closely match that of the policyholder liabilities the asset liability relationship is appropriately managed in aigs domestic operations as there is ample supply of qualified long term investments aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes 36 american international group inc and subsidiaries a number of guaranteed benefits are offered on certain variable life products for further discussion see note 7 of notes to financial statements dac for life insurance products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new or renewal business policy acquisition costs for traditional life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy policy acquisition costs which relate to universal life and investment type products including fixed annuities nontraditional life products are deferred and amortized with interest as appropriate in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts with respect to variable annuities aigs policy as appropriate has been to adjust amortization assumptions for dac when estimates of current or future gross profits to be realized from these contracts are revised with respect to variable annuities sold domestically representing the vast majority of aigs variable annuity business the assumption for the long term annual net growth rate of the equity markets used in the determination of dac amortization is approximately 10 percent a methodology referred to as reversion to the mean is used to maintain this long term net growth rate assumption while giving consideration to short term variations in equity markets estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses on investments less interest required as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the impact on the amortization of dac the estimation of projected gross profits requires significant management judgment the elements with respect to the current and projected gross profits are reviewed and analyzed quarterly and are appropriately adjusted aigs variable annuity earnings will be affected by changes in market returns because separate account revenues primarily composed of mortality and expense charges and asset management fees are a function of asset values dac for both traditional life and nontraditional life products as well as retirement services products are subject to review for recoverability which involve estimating the future profitability of current business this review also involves significant management judgment if the actual emergence of future profitability were to be substantially different than that estimated aigs results of operations could be significantly impacted insurance and asset management invested assets aigs general strategy is to invest in high quality securities while maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure to issuer industry and or country concentrations with respect to general insurance aigs strategy is to invest in longer duration fixed maturities to maximize the yields at the date of purchase with respect to life insurance and retirement services aigs strategy is to produce cash flows required to meet maturing insurance liabilities see also the discussion under operating review life insurance and retirement services operations herein aig invests in equities for various reasons including diversifying its overall exposure to interest rate risk equity securities are subject to declines in fair value such declines in fair value are presented in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments net of taxes as a component of other comprehensive income generally insurance regulations restrict the types of assets in which an insurance company may invest when permitted by regulatory authorities and when deemed necessary to protect insurance assets including invested assets from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices aig and its insurance subsidiaries may enter into derivative transactions as end users see also the discussion under derivatives herein in certain jurisdictions significant regulatory and or foreign governmental barriers exist which may not permit the immediate free flow of funds between insurance

40 billion of bond trading securities at market value b includes 1 91 billion of preferred stocks at market value data table removed a includes 282 million of bond trading securities at market value b includes 1 90 billion of preferred stocks at market value credit quality at september 30 2004 approximately 64 percent of the fixed maturities investments were domestic securities approximately 32 percent of such domestic securities were rated aaa by one or more of the principal rating agencies approximately 7 percent were below investment grade or not rated a significant portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio is rated by moodys standard and poors s and p or similar foreign services similar credit quality rating services are not available in all overseas locations aig annually reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolio nonrated fixed income investments including mortgages at september 30 2004 approximately 20 percent of the foreign fixed income investments were either rated aaa or on the basis of aigs internal analysis were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities so rated approximately 5 percent were below investment grade or not rated at that date a large portion of the foreign fixed income portfolio are sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date valuation of invested assets the valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market value for each security the source for the market value is generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of nontraded securities another aspect of valuation is an assessment of impairment as a matter of policy the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and 38 american international group inc and subsidiaries the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of aigs management and a continual review of its investments in general a security is considered a candidate for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant discount to par amortized cost if lower or cost for an extended period of time the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation or ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or in the opinion of aigs management it is possible that aig may not realize a full recovery on its investment irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events once a security has been identified as impaired the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price aig has the ability to hold any security to its stated maturity therefore the decision to sell reflects the judgment of aigs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale as a result of these policies aig recorded impairment losses net of taxes of 361 million and 798 million in the first nine months of 2004 and 2003 respectively the recovery in global equity markets and reasonably steady domestic interest rates were the primary reasons for the decline in impairment loss recognition from 2003 to 2004 no impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to aigs consolidated financial condition or results of operations and no individual impairment loss exceeded 1 0 percent of consolidated net income for the first nine months of 2004 excluding the impairments noted above the changes in market value for aigs available for sale portfolio which constitutes the vast majority of aigs investments were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized gains or losses at september 30 2004 the aggregate unrealized losses after taxes of the fixed maturity securities were approximately 1 4 billion at september 30 2004 the aggregate unrealized losses after taxes of the equity securities portfolio were approximately 168 million at september 30 2004 aggregate unrealized gains after taxes were 10 8 billion and aggregate unrealized losses after taxes were 1 5 billion at september 30 2004 the fair value of aigs fixed maturities and equity securities aggregated to 365 1 billion the impact on net income of unrealized losses after taxes will be further mitigated upon realization because certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts and realization will result in current decreases in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs at september 30 2004 unrealized losses for fixed maturity securities and equity securities did not reflect any significant industry concentrations the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale in an unrealized loss position at september 30 2004 by contractual maturity is shown below data table removed in the nine months ended september 30 2004 the pretax realized losses incurred with respect to the sale of fixed maturities and equity securities were 1 2 billion the aggregate fair value of securities sold was 28 6 billion which was approximately 98 percent of amortized cost the average period of time that securities sold at a loss during the nine months ended september 30 2004 were trading continuously at a price below book value was approximately four months 39 american international group inc and subsidiaries at september 30 2004 aggregate pretax unrealized gains were 16 6 billion while the pretax unrealized losses with respect to investment grade bonds below investment grade bonds and equity securities were 1 61 billion 500 million and 258 million respectively aging of the pretax unrealized losses with respect to these securities distributed as a percentage of cost relative to unrealized loss the extent by which the market value is less than amortized cost or cost including the number of respective items was as follows data table removed a for bonds represents amortized cost b as more fully described above upon realization certain realized losses will be charged to participating policyholder accounts or realization will result in a current decrease in the amortization of certain deferred acquisition costs as stated previously the valuation for aigs investment portfolio comes from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of nontraded securities aig considers nontraded securities to mean certain fixed income investments certain structured securities direct private equities limited partnerships and hedge funds the aggregate carrying value of these securities at september 30 2004 was approximately 65 5 billion the methodology used to estimate the fair value of nontraded fixed income investments is by reference to traded securities with similar attributes and using a matrix pricing methodology this technique takes into account such factors as the industry the securitys rating and tenor its coupon rate its position in the capital structure of the issuer and other relevant factors the change in fair value is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income for certain structured securities the carrying value is based on an estimate of the securitys future cash flows pursuant to the requirements of emerging issues task force issue no 99 20 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets the change in carrying value of these assets is recognized in income direct private equities hedge funds and limited partnerships in which aig holds in the aggregate less than a five percent interest are carried at fair value the change in fair value is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income with respect to hedge funds and limited partnerships in which aig holds in the aggregate a five percent or greater interest aigs carrying value is the net asset value the changes in such net asset values are recorded in life insurance and retirement services or general insurance net investment income as appropriate aig obtains the fair value of its investments in limited partnerships and hedge funds from information provided by the sponsors of each of these investments the accounts of which are generally audited on an annual basis each of these investment categories is regularly tested to determine if impairment in value exists various valuation techniques are used with respect to each category in this determination 40 american international group inc and subsidiaries financial services operations aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified financial products and services including aircraft leasing capital market transactions and consumer and insurance premium financing see also note 2 of notes to financial statements aigs aircraft finance operations represent the operations of international lease finance corporation ilfc which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to domestic and foreign airlines revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account for airlines and for financial institutions ilfc finances its purchases of aircraft primarily through the issuance of a variety of debt instruments the composite borrowing rates at the end of the first nine months of 2004 and 2003 were 4 20 percent and 4 63 percent respectively see also the discussions under capital resources and liquidity herein and note 2 of notes to financial statements ilfc is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through nonperformance of aircraft lessees through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and in part through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease ilfc manages its lessee nonperformance exposure through credit reviews and security deposit requirements as a result of these measures and its own contingency planning ilfc did not suffer any material losses from airline shutdowns in the aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks but there can be no assurance that ilfc will successfully manage the risks relating to the impact of possible future deterioration in the airline industry over 80 percent of ilfcs fleet is leased to non u s carriers and this fleet comprised of the most efficient aircraft in the airline industry continues to be in high demand from such carriers ilfc typically contracts to re lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term for aircraft returned before the end of the lease term ilfc has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return while some of the lease rates for aircraft that have been redeployed are lower the impact of these reduced revenues is partially offset by low interest rates which reduce ilfcs financing costs as a lessor ilfc considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent at september 30 2004 there were two aircraft off lease see also the discussions under capital resources and liquidity herein during 2004 ilfc entered into a securitization of a portfolio of 34 aircraft certain of aigs life insurance and retirement services businesses purchased a large share of this securitization ilfc management is very active in the airline industry management formally reviews regularly and no less frequently than quarterly issues affecting ilfcs fleet including events and circumstances that may cause impairment of aircraft values management evaluates aircraft in the fleet as necessary based on these events and circumstances in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 144 ilfc has not recognized any impairment related to its fleet as the existing service potential of the aircraft in ilfcs portfolio has not been diminished further ilfc has been able to re lease the aircraft without diminution in lease rates to an extent that would require an impairment write down see also the discussions under liquidity herein in the third quarter of 2003 aig integrated the operations of aig trading group inc and its subsidiaries aigtg with aig financial products corp and its subsidiaries aigfp thereby establishing the capital markets operating and reporting unit aig believes that this will result in greater efficiencies and product synergies as well as growth opportunities as capital markets is a transaction oriented operation current and past revenues and operating results may not provide a basis for predicting future performance aigs capital markets operations derive substantially all their revenues from hedged proprietary positions entered in connection with counterparty transactions rather than from speculative transactions these subsidiaries participate in the derivatives dealer market conducting primarily as principal an interest rate currency equity commodity and credit derivative products business as dealers aigfp and aigtg mark transactions to fair value daily thus a gain or loss on each transaction is recognized daily aigfp and aigtg hedge the market risks arising from their transactions therefore revenues and operating income are not significantly exposed to or affected by market fluctuations and volatility revenues of the capital markets operations and the percentage change in revenues for any given period are significantly affected by the number and size of transactions entered into by these subsidiaries during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period operating income and the percentage change in operating income for any period are determined by the number size and profitability of the transactions attributable to that period relative to those attributable to the prior period generally the realization of trading revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on capital markets trading transactions are currently reflected in operating income as the fair values change from period to period derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of capital markets operations therefore income on interest rate currency equity commodity and credit deriva 41 american international group inc and subsidiaries tives along with their related hedges are recorded on a mark to market value or at estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in the income statement in the current year in the first nine months of 2004 less than five percent of revenues resulted from transactions valued at estimated fair value the mark to fair value of derivative transactions is reflected in the balance sheet in the captions unrealized gain on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions and unrealized loss on interest rate and currency swaps options and forward transactions pursuant to isda master agreements unrealized gains represent the present value of the aggregate of each net receivable by counterparty and unrealized losses represent the present value of the aggregate of each net payable by counterparty as of september 30 2004 these amounts will change from one period to the next due to changes in interest rates currency rates equity prices and other market variables as well as cash movements execution of new transactions and the maturing of existing transactions see also the discussion under derivatives herein spread income on investments and borrowings are recorded on an accrual basis over the life of the transaction investments are classified as securities available for sale and are marked to market with the resulting unrealized gains or losses reflected in shareholders equity domestically aigs consumer finance operations derive a substantial portion of their revenues from finance charges assessed on outstanding mortgages home equity loans secured and unsecured consumer loans and retail merchant financing credit quality continues to be strong and receivables grew substantially overseas operations provide credit cards personal and auto loans term deposits savings accounts sales finance and mortgages with an emphasis on emerging markets consumer finance operations are exposed to loss when contractual payments are not received collection exposure is managed through the mix of tight underwriting controls mix of loans and collateral thereon financial services operations for the nine months ending september 30 2004 and 2003 were as follows data table removed data table removed financial services results financial services operating income increased in the first nine months of 2004 compared to the same period of 2003 the increase occurred because of the growth in consumer finance operating income despite the impact of ilfcs disposition of approximately 2 billion in aircraft through securitizations in the third quarter of 2003 and first quarter of 2004 and the reduced income from capital markets operations fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of capital markets operations financial services operating income represented 14 1 percent of aigs consolidated income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first nine months of 2004 this compares to 17 9 percent in the same period of 2003 with respect to ilfc the revenue growth in the first nine months of 2004 resulted primarily from the increase in flight equipment under operating lease and the increase in the relative value of the leased fleet 42 american international group inc and subsidiaries the composition by percentage contribution of revenues and operating income for capital markets operations in the first nine months of 2004 and 2003 is set forth below the percentages for operating income are the same as those for revenues because expenses are allocated across all products in proportion to the revenues generated by that product material changes in the distribution of revenues and operating income from period to period are not unusual due to the transactional nature of the capital markets business data table removed financial market conditions in the first nine months of 2004 compared with the first nine months of 2003 were characterized by interest rates which were broadly unchanged across fixed income markets globally a tightening of credit spreads and higher equity valuations capital markets results in 2004 compared with 2003 reflected a shift in product segment activity to respond to these conditions the most significant component of capital markets operating expenses is compensation which approximated 34 percent and 33 percent of revenues in the first nine months of 2004 and 2003 respectively consumer finance revenues in the first nine months of 2004 increased the increase in revenues in the first nine months of 2004 was the result of growth in average finance receivables and credit quality continues to be strong foreign consumer finance operations performed

capital resources and derivatives herein data table removed as previously discussed the cash used for the purchase of flight equipment is derived primarily from the proceeds of ilfcs debt financings the primary sources for the repayment of this debt and the interest expense thereon are the cash flow from operations proceeds from the sale of flight equipment and the rollover and refinancing of the

significant downgrades through november 1 2004 aigfps risk management objective is to minimize interest rate equity and currency risks associated with its securities available for sale that is when aigfp purchases a security for its securities available for sale investment portfolio it simultaneously enters into an offsetting fair value hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction exactly offset the payment terms of the investment security as a result of the hedging transaction the holder of the investment security pays the return on the underlying security and receives overnight usd libor plus or minus a spread based on the underlying profit on each security on the initial trade date the unrealized gains or losses that inure to the security from movements in interest rates currency rates or equity prices and the change in value of the related hedging transaction are recorded in operating income currently the unrealized gain or loss that relates to the change in the un hedged risk credit spreads with respect to these investments is recorded in shareholders equity net of tax when a security is sold the related hedging transaction is also terminated the realized gain or loss with respect to each security and its related hedge are recorded in operating income securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized

certain restrictions imposed by statutory authorities with respect to aigs domestic insurance subsidiaries specifically the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled under the laws of many states an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain materiality thresholds with respect to aigs foreign insurance subsidiaries the most significant insurance regulatory jurisdictions include bermuda japan hong kong and the republic of china at september 30 2004 there were no significant statutory or regulatory issues which would impair aigs financial condition results of operations or liquidity but there can be no assurance that such issues will not arise in the future to aigs knowledge no aig company is on any regulatory or similar watch list see also the discussion under liquidity herein regulation and supervision aigs insurance subsidiaries in common with other insurers are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business the national association of insurance commissioners naic has developed risk based capital rbc requirements rbc relates an individual insurance companys statutory surplus to the risk inherent in its overall operations at september 30 2004 the risk based adjusted surplus of each of aigs domestic general companies and of each of aigs domestic life companies exceeded each of their rbc standards as discussed in recent developments above various regulators have commenced investigations into certain insurance business practices while such investigations are in their early stages it is possible that they may result in additional regulation of the insurance industry and aig cannot predict the ultimate impact that such additional regulation might have on its business federal state or local legislation may affect aigs ability to operate and expand its various financial services businesses and changes in the current laws regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses aigs operations are negatively impacted under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states as a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state aig generally records these assessments upon notice additionally certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities therefore the ultimate net assessment cannot rea 48 american international group inc and subsidiaries sonably be estimated the guarantee fund assessments net of credits for 2003 were 77 million based upon current information aig does not anticipate that its net assessment will be significantly different during 2004 aig is also required to participate in various involuntary pools principally workers compensation business which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets this participation is also recorded upon notification as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated a substantial portion of aigs general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance and retirement services business are conducted in foreign countries the degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies from minimal in some to stringent in others generally aig as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements licenses issued by foreign authorities to aig subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation thus aigs insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate aigs international operations include operations in various developing nations both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable

from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance and retirement services operations at september 30 2004 aigs consolidated invested assets included 16 74 billion of cash and short term investments consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in the first nine months of 2004 amounted to 20 43 billion sources of funds considered in meeting the objectives of aigs financial services operations include guaranteed investment agreements issuance of long term and short term debt maturities and sales of securities available for sale securities sold under repurchase agreements trading liabilities securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased issuance of equity and cash provided from such operations aigs strong capital position and superior credit ratings are integral to managing this liquidity as they enable aig to raise funds in diverse markets worldwide see also the discussion under capital resources herein management believes that aigs liquid assets its net cash provided by operations and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet any foreseeable cash requirements the liquidity of the combined insurance operations is derived both domestically and abroad the combined insurance operating cash flow is derived from two sources underwriting operations and investment operations in the aggregate aigs insurance operations generated approximately 47 4 billion in pretax cash flow during the first nine months of 2004 cash flow includes periodic premium collections including policyholders contract deposits cash flows from investment operations and paid loss recoveries less reinsurance premiums losses benefits and acquisition and operating expenses generally there is a time lag from when premiums are collected and when as a result of the occurrence of events specified in the policy the losses and benefits are paid aigs insurance investment operations generated approximately 13 2 billion in investment income cash flow during the first nine months of 2004 investment income cash flow is primarily derived from interest and dividends received and includes realized capital gains net of realized capital losses see also the discussions under operating review general insurance operations and life insurance and retirement services operations herein with respect to general insurance operations if paid losses accelerated beyond aigs ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows aig might need to liquidate a portion of its general insurance investment portfolio and or arrange for financing potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the result of several significant catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such paid losses were sold into a depressed market place and or reinsurance recoverable on such paid losses became uncollectible or collateral supporting such reinsurance recoverable significantly decreased in value see also the discussions under operating review general insurance operations herein with respect to life insurance and retirement services operations if a substantial portion of the life insurance and retirement services operations bond portfolio diminished significantly in value and or defaulted aig might need to liquidate other portions of its life insurance and retirement services investment portfolio and or arrange financing potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be the 50 american international group inc and subsidiaries result of economic collapse of a nation or region in which aig life insurance and retirement services operations exist nationalization terrorist acts or other such economic or political upheaval see also the discussions under operating review life insurance and retirement services operations herein in addition to the combined insurance pretax operating cash flow aigs insurance operations held 13 77 billion in cash and short term investments at september 30 2004 operating cash flow and the cash and short term balances held provided aigs insurance operations with a significant amount of liquidity this liquidity is available among other things to purchase predominately high quality and diversified fixed income securities and to a lesser extent marketable equity securities and to provide mortgage loans on real estate policy loans and collateral loans this cash flow coupled with proceeds of approximately 114 billion from the maturities sales and redemptions of fixed income securities and from the sale of equity securities was used to purchase approximately 154 billion of fixed income securities and marketable equity securities during the first nine months of 2004 managing market risk market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies equities and commodity prices aig has exposures to these risks aig analyzes market risk using various statistical techniques including value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that applies the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors to aigs market positions the output from the var calculation is the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability aig believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management insurance aig has performed a var analysis to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for each of aigs insurance segments and for each market risk within each insurance segment in this analysis financial instrument assets include the domestic and foreign invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued financial instrument liabilities include reserve for losses and loss expenses reserve for unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and policyholders funds due to the nature of each insurance segment aig manages the general and life insurance and retirement services operations separately as a result aig manages separately the invested assets of each accordingly the var analysis was separately performed for the general and the life insurance and retirement services operations aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aigs insurance segments as of september 30 2004 and december 31 2003 aig uses the historical simulation methodology which entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period in this case the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices were used to construct the historical scenarios for each scenario each transaction was repriced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values were then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the var number represents the maximum potential loss incurred by these scenarios with a 95 percent confidence i e only 5 percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure a one month holding period was assumed in computing the var figure the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of september 30 2004 and december 31 2003 var with respect to combined operations cannot be derived by aggregating the individual risk or segment amounts presented herein data table removed 51 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents the average high and low vars on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of september 30 2004 and december 31 2003 data table removed financial services aig generally manages its market exposures within financial services by taking offsetting positions capital markets seeks to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered market positions credit exposure is managed separately see the discussion on the management of credit risk below aigs market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aigs market exposures particularly those market exposures of the capital markets operations this department determines whether aigs market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aigs senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary ilfc is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates as of september 30 2004 and december 31 2003 aig statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a var model in this analysis the net fair value of aircraft finance operations was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt the estimated impact of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of aircraft finance operations using the historical simulation methodology as previously described as of september 30 2004 and december 31 2003 the average var with respect to the net fair value of aircraft finance operations was approximately 52 million and 38 million respectively capital markets operations are exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices aigfp and aigtg hedge their exposure to these risks primarily through swaps options forwards and futures to economically hedge interest rate risks these subsidiaries may also purchase u s and foreign government obligations aigfp and aigtg do not seek to manage the market risk of each transaction through an individual offsetting transaction rather these subsidiaries take a portfolio approach to the management of their market risk exposures aigfp and aigtg value their entire portfolios of market sensitive transactions at market value or at estimated fair value when market values are not readily available unrealized gains and losses with respect to this portfolio are reflected in income currently these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows of capital markets transactions and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfp and aigs management estimated fair values are based upon the use of valuation models these models utilize among other things market liquidity and current interest foreign exchange equity commodity and volatility rates these valuation models are integrated into the evaluation of the portfolio as described above in order to provide timely information for the market risk management of the portfolio based upon this evaluation aigfp and aigtg determine what if any offsetting transactions are necessary to reduce the market risk exposure of the portfolio aigfp and aigtg manage market risk with a variety of transactions including swaps trading securities futures and forward contracts and other transactions as appropriate the recorded values of these transactions may be different than the values that might be realized if these subsidiaries were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that such differences are not significant to the results of operations financial condition or liquidity such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity 52 american international group inc and subsidiaries aigfp and aigtg attempt to secure reliable and independent current market prices such as published exchange prices external subscription services such as from bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available these subsidiaries use an internal methodology which includes interpolation or extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions historically actual results have not materially deviated from these models systems used by capital markets operations can monitor each units respective market positions on an intraday basis the subsidiaries operate in major business centers overseas and are essentially open for business 24 hours a day thus the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored reviewed and coordinated around the clock aigfp and aigtg apply various testing techniques which reflect significant potential market movements in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity and equity prices volatility levels and the effect of time these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio the results from these analyses are regularly reviewed by senior management as described above capital markets operations are exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices aig statistically measured the losses of fair value through the application of a var model across both units capital markets asset and liability portfolios for which the var analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments derivative instruments and commodities because the market

table removed derivatives derivatives are financial instruments among two or more parties with returns linked to or derived from some underlying equity debt commodity or other asset liability or index derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities certain commodities financial or commodity indices or other variables the more significant types of derivative arrangements in which aig transacts are swaps forwards futures and options in the normal course of business with the agreement of the original counterparty these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty the overwhelming majority of aigs derivatives activities are conducted by the capital markets operations thus permitting aig to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal in these derivative operations aig structures agreements which generally allow its counterparties to enter into transactions with respect to changes in interest and exchange rates securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices aigs customers such as corporations financial institutions multinational organizations sovereign entities government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures for example a futures forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations a counterparty may default on any obligation to aig including a derivative contract credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions credit risk exists for a derivative contract when 53 american international group inc and subsidiaries that contract has a positive fair value to aig to help manage this risk the credit departments of aigfp and aigtg operate within the guidelines set by the aig credit risk committee this committee establishes the credit policy sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings in addition to credit ratings this committee takes into account other factors including the industry and country of the counterparty transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the approval of the aig credit risk committee it is also aigs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary aigs derivatives review committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction except those derivative transactions entered into by capital markets for their own accounts the committee examines among other things the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction its potential credit exposure if any and the estimated benefits generally aig conducts its businesses in the currencies of the local operating environment thus exchange gains or losses occur when aigs foreign currency net investment is affected by changes in the foreign exchange rates relative to the u s dollar from one reporting period to the next legal risk with respect to derivatives arises from the uncertainty of the enforceability through legal or judicial processes of the obligations of aigs clients and counterparties including contractual provisions intended to reduce credit exposure by providing for the
