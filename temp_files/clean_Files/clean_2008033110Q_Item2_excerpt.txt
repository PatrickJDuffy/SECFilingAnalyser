item 2 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is designed to provide the reader a narrative with respect to aigs operations financial condition and liquidity and certain other significant matters index data table removed cautionary statement regarding projections and other information about future events this quarterly report on form 10 q and other publicly available documents may include and aigs officers and representatives may from time to time make projections concerning financial information and statements concerning future economic performance and events plans and objectives relating to management operations products and services and assumptions underlying these projections and statements these projections and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only aigs belief regarding future events many of which by their nature are inherently uncertain and outside aigs control these projections and statements may address among other things the status and potential future outcome of the current regulatory and civil proceedings against aig and their potential effect on aigs businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity aigs exposures to subprime mortgages monoline insurers and the residential real estate market and aigs strategy for growth product development market position financial results and reserves it is possible that aigs actual results and financial condition may differ possibly

aigs annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2007 2007 annual report on form 10 k aig is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligations to update or alter any projection or other statement whether written or oral that may be made from time to time whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 35 american international group inc and subsidiaries in addition to reviewing aigs results for the first three months of 2008 this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supplements and updates the information and discussion included in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aig presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful statutory loss ratios and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance filed with insurance regulatory authorities and used for analysis in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with aigs insurance competitors aig also uses cross references to additional information included in this quarterly report on form 10 q and in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject overview of operations and business results aig identifies its reportable segments by product line consistent with its management structure these segments are general insurance life insurance and retirement services financial services and asset management through these operating segments aig provides insurance financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions this geographic product and service diversification is one of aigs major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors aigs other category consists of items not allocated to aigs operating segments aigs subsidiaries serve commercial institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network in the united states aig companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and are among the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well aigs financial services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing capital markets operations and consumer finance both in the united states and abroad aig also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals as part of its spread based investment activities and to finance its operations aig issues various debt instruments in the public and private markets outlook the following paragraphs supplement and update the information and discussion included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k to reflect developments in or affecting aigs business to date during 2008 these paragraphs also supplement and update item 1a risk factors in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k general trends in mid 2007 the u s residential mortgage market began to experience serious disruption due to credit quality deterioration in a significant portion of loans originated particularly to non prime and subprime borrowers evolving changes in the regulatory environment a slower residential housing market increased cost of borrowings for mortgage participants and illiquid credit markets the conditions continued and worsened throughout 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 expanding into the broader u s credit markets and resulting in greater volatility less liquidity widening of credit spreads a lack of price transparency and increased credit losses in certain markets aig participates in the u s residential mortgage market in several ways american general finance inc agf originates principally first lien mortgage loans and to a lesser extent second lien mortgage loans to buyers and owners of residential housing united guaranty corporation ugc provides first loss mortgage guaranty insurance for high loan to value first and second lien residential mortgages aig insurance and financial services subsidiaries invest in mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations cdos in which the underlying collateral is composed in whole or in part of residential mortgage loans and aig financial products corp and aig trading group inc and their respective subsidiaries collectively aigfp provides credit protection through credit default swaps on certain super senior tranches of cdos a significant majority of which have aaa underlying or subordinate layers continuing disruption in the u s residential mortgage and other credit markets may also increase claim activity in the financial institution segment of aigs directors and officers liability d and o and professional liability classes of business however based on its review of information currently available aig believes overall loss activity for the broader d and o and professional liability classes is likely to remain within or near the levels observed during the last several years which include losses related to stock options backdating as well as to the u s residential mortgage market the operating results of aigs consumer finance and mortgage guaranty operations in the united states have been and are likely to continue to be adversely affected by the factors referred to above the downward cycle in the u s housing market is not expected to improve until residential inventories return to a more normal level and the mortgage credit market stabilizes the duration and severity of the downward cycle could be further negatively affected in the event of an economic recession aig expects that this downward cycle will continue to adversely affect ugcs operating results for the foreseeable future and will result in a 36 american international group inc and subsidiaries significant operating loss for ugc in 2008 and possibly beyond aig also incurred substantial unrealized market valuation losses on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio and substantial other than temporary impairment charges on aigs available for sale securities in the first quarter of 2008 and fourth quarter of 2007 the results from aigs operations with exposure to the u s residential mortgage market will be highly dependent on future market conditions continuing market deterioration will cause aig to report additional unrealized market valuation losses and impairment charges the ongoing effect of the downward cycle in the u s housing market on aigs consolidated financial condition could be material if the market disruption continues to expand beyond the residential mortgage markets although aig seeks to mitigate the risks to its business by disciplined underwriting and active risk management credit ratings are important to aigs business results of operations and liquidity downgrades in aigs credit ratings could increase aigs borrowing costs and could adversely affect its competitive position and liquidity with respect to aigs liquidity it is estimated that as of the close of business on april 30 2008 based on aigfps outstanding municipal guaranteed investment agreements gias and financial derivative transactions at that date a downgrade of aigs longer term senior debt ratings to aa3 by moodys investors service moodys or aa by standard and poors a division of the mcgraw hill companies s and p would permit counterparties to call for approximately 1 8 billion of collateral while a downgrade to a1 by moodys or a by s and p would permit counterparties to call for approximately 9 8 billion of additional collateral further downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral which could have a material adverse effect on how aigfp manages its liquidity the actual amount of collateral that aigfp would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade additional obligations to post collateral would increase the demands on aigfps liquidity globally heightened regulatory scrutiny of financial services companies in many jurisdictions has the potential to affect future financial results through higher compliance costs this is particularly true in the united states where federal and state authorities have commenced various investigations of the financial services industry and in japan and southeast asia where financial institutions have received remediation orders affecting consumer and policyholder rights capital resources in light of the ongoing significant effects the disruption in the u s housing and credit markets is having on aigs results aig is planning to raise additional capital to fortify its balance sheet and increase financial flexibility general insurance the commercial property and casualty insurance industry has historically experienced cycles of price erosion followed by rate strengthening as a result of catastrophes or other significant losses that affect the overall capacity of the industry to provide coverage as premium rates decline aig will generally experience higher current accident year loss ratios as the written premiums are earned and higher expense ratios if written premiums decline more quickly than expenses despite industry price erosion in commercial lines aig expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new general insurance businesses as a result of aigs broad product line and extensive distribution networks in the united states and abroad workers compensation remains under considerable pricing pressure as statutory rates continue to decline rates for most casualty lines of insurance continue to decline due to competitive pressures particularly for aviation excess casualty and d and o exposures rates for commercial property lines are also declining following another year of relatively low catastrophe losses further price erosion is expected during the remainder of 2008 for the commercial lines aig seeks to mitigate the decline by constantly seeking out profitable opportunities across its diverse product lines and distribution networks while maintaining a commitment to underwriting discipline there can be no assurance that price erosion will not become more widespread or that aigs profitability will not deteriorate from current levels in major commercial lines the personal lines market has softened considerably and further deterioration in underwriting results is expected to continue through 2009 a generally weakening economy and increasing loss trends are contributing factors aig is filing for rate increases and tightening underwriting guidelines where necessary in response to the changing market conditions life insurance and retirement services disruption in the u s residential mortgage and credit markets had a significant adverse effect on life insurance and retirement services operating results specifically its net investment income and net realized capital losses in 2007 and the first three months of 2008 and aig expects that this disruption will continue to be a key factor in the remainder of 2008 and beyond especially in its u s based operations the volatility in operating results will be further magnified by the 37 american international group inc and subsidiaries continuing market shift to variable products with living benefits in response to the market disruption aig including domestic life and domestic retirement services has been increasing its liquidity position and investing in shorter duration investments while prudent in the current environment such actions will reduce overall investment yields recent capital markets volatility has put pressure on credit lenders resulting in increased costs for premium financing which could affect future sales of products where such financing is used primarily in large universal life policies in domestic life insurance the u s dollar has significantly weakened against many currencies resulting in a favorable effect on operating results due to the translation of foreign currencies to the u s dollar however the weakened dollar has an unfavorable effect on other than temporary impairments in foreign life insurance and retirement services and will continue to affect operating results throughout 2008 an additional capital contribution to operations in taiwan is planned for the second quarter of 2008 in order to meet the needs of this growing business and increased risk based capital requirements the amount of the additional capital contribution is expected to be approximately 400 million financial services aig exercises significant judgment in the valuation of its various credit default swap portfolios aig uses pricing models and other methodologies to value these portfolios that take into account where applicable and to the extent possible third party prices pricing matrices the movement of indices such as the cdx and itraxx collateral calls and other observable market data there is no uniform methodology used by market participants in valuing these types of portfolios aig believes that the assumptions and judgments it makes are reasonable and lead to an overall methodology that is reasonable but other market participants may use other methodologies including among other things models indices and selection of third party pricing sources that are based upon different assumptions and judgments and these methodologies may generate materially different values aig regularly updates and analyzes the appropriateness of its valuation methodologies updates to or changes in aigs methodologies or assumptions may materially change aigs estimates of the value of its credit default swap portfolios for additional information regarding aigs methodology models and assumptions with respect to the valuation and credit based analyses of the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio see critical accounting estimates fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio and valuation of level 3 assets and liabilities super senior credit default swap portfolio also refer to risk management credit derivatives the ongoing disruption in the u s residential mortgage and credit markets and the downgrades of residential mortgage backed securities and cdo securities by rating agencies continue to adversely affect the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio written by aigfp aig expects that continuing limitations on the availability of market observable data will affect aigs determinations of the fair value of these derivatives including by preventing aig for the foreseeable future from recognizing the beneficial effect of the differential between credit spreads used to price a credit default swap and spreads implied from prices of the cdo bonds referenced by such swap the fair value of these derivatives is expected to continue to fluctuate perhaps materially in response to changing market conditions and aigs estimates of the value of aigfps super senior credit derivative portfolio at future dates could therefore be materially different from current estimates further declines in the fair values of these derivatives may require aigfp to post additional collateral which may be material to aigfps financial condition under the terms of most of these credit derivatives losses to aig would generally result from the credit impairment of the referenced cdo bonds that aig would acquire in satisfying its swap obligations based upon its most current analyses aig believes that any credit impairment losses which may emerge over time at aigfp will not be material to aigs consolidated financial condition but could be material to the manner in which aig manages its liquidity in making this assessment aig uses a credit based analysis to estimate potential realized credit impairment losses from aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio this analysis makes various assumptions as to estimates of future stresses on the portfolio resulting from further downgrades by the rating agencies of the cdo collateral in addition during the first quarter of 2008 aig introduced another methodology called a roll rate analysis this methodology rolls forward current and estimated future delinquencies and defaults in underlying mortgages in the cdo collateral pools to estimate potential losses in the cdos due to the dislocation in the market for cdo collateral aig does not use the market values of the underlying cdo collateral in estimating its potential realized credit impairment losses the use of factors derived from market observable prices in models used to determine the estimates for future realized credit impairment losses would result in materially higher estimates of realized credit impairment losses aigs credit based analyses estimate potential realized credit impairment pre tax losses at 38 american international group inc and subsidiaries approximately 1 2 billion to approximately 2 4 billion other types of analyses or models could result in materially different estimates aig is aware that other market participants have used different assumptions and methodologies to estimate the potential realized credit impairment losses on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio resulting in a significantly higher estimate than that resulting from aigs credit based analysis for example a third party analysis provided to aig that aig understands uses credit and market value inputs estimates the potential realized pre tax losses on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio at between approximately 9 billion and approximately 11 billion aig expresses no view as to the reasonableness of this third party estimate and does not intend to seek an update of this estimate there can be no assurance that aigs estimate will not change or that the ultimate realized losses on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio will not exceed any current estimates approximately 335 billion of the 469 billion in notional exposure on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio as of march 31 2008 was written to facilitate regulatory capital relief for financial institutions primarily in europe aig expects that the majority of these transactions will be terminated within the next 12 to 24 months by aigfps counterparties as they implement models compliant with the new basel ii accord as of april 30 2008 55 billion in notional exposures have either been terminated or are in the process of being terminated at the request of counterparties in its 2007 annual report on form 10 k aig had previously reported that as of february 26 2008 54 billion in notional exposures have either been terminated or are in the process of being terminated aig has recently refined its approach to estimating its net notional exposures on certain of these transactions that have unique features the notional exposures on transactions terminated or that were in the process of being terminated as of february 26 2008 is 46 billion under the refined method aigfp was not required to make any payments as part of these terminations and in certain cases was paid a fee upon termination in light of this experience to date and after other comprehensive analyses aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment to be recognized for this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the three months ended march 31 2008 aig will continue to assess the valuation of this portfolio and monitor developments in the marketplace given the significant deterioration in the global credit markets and the risk that aigfps expectations with respect to the termination of these transactions by its counterparties may not materialize there can be no assurance that aig will not recognize unrealized market valuation losses from this portfolio in future periods and recognition of even a small percentage decline in the fair value of this portfolio could be material to an individual reporting period these transactions contributed approximately 89 million to aigfps revenues in the three months ended march 31 2008 if aigfp is not successful in replacing the revenues generated by these transactions aigfps operating results could be materially adversely affected approximately 57 billion of the 469 billion in notional exposure on aigfps super senior credit default swaps as of march 31 2008 was written on investment grade corporate debt and clos there is no uniform methodology to estimate the fair value of corporate super senior credit default swaps aig estimates the fair value of its corporate credit default swap portfolio by reference to benchmark indices including the cdx and itraxx and third party prices and collateral calls aig believes that its methodology to value the corporate credit default swap portfolio is reasonable but other market participants use other methodologies and these methodologies may generate materially different fair value estimates no assurance can be given that the fair value of aigs corporate credit default swap portfolio would not change materially if other market indices or pricing sources were used to estimate the fair value of the portfolio for a description of important factors that may affect the operations and initiatives described above see item 1a risk factors in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k consolidated results aigs consolidated revenues income loss before income taxes minority interest and net income loss were as follows data table removed aigs consolidated revenues decreased in the three months ended march 31 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to an unrealized market valuation loss of 9 1 billion on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio recorded in other income higher net realized capital losses and a decline in net investment income which more than offset growth in premiums and other considerations in the life insurance and retirement services segment net realized capital losses of 6 1 billion in the three months ended march 31 2008 included other than temporary impairment charges of 5 6 billion primarily related to the significant disruption in the residential mortgage and credit

impairment charges in the three months ended march 31 2007 were 467 million see invested assets portfolio review other than temporary impairments herein the decline in net investment income reflects lower returns from partnerships hedge funds and mutual funds as well as lower policyholder trading gains in life insurance and retirement services policyholder trading gains are offset by a charge to incurred policy losses and benefits expense income loss before income taxes and minority interest declined in the three months ended march 31 2008 due primarily to the losses described above income taxes the effective tax rate on pre tax income for the year ended december 31 2007 was 16 3 percent the effective rate was low due to the unrealized market valuation losses on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio and other than temporary impairment charges the effective tax rate on the pre tax loss for the first three months of 2008 was 31 4 percent the effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35 percent due primarily to 703 million of tax charges for the first three months of 2008 comprised of increases in the reserves for uncertain tax positions and other

and net realized capital gains losses the decrease in general insurance revenues in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 was due to net realized capital losses for the

insurance operating income in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 was driven by aig commercial insurance commercial insurance reflecting lower underwriting profit and net investment income as well as net realized capital losses incurred by commercial insurance in 2008 operating losses from the mortgage guaranty business and a decline in foreign general insurance net investment income in the first three months of 2008 also contributed to the decrease in general insurance operating income 40 american international group inc and subsidiaries life insurance and

income loss declined in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to higher net realized capital losses in 2008 in addition the operating loss in the first three months of 2008 was negatively affected by trading account losses in the u k associated with certain investment linked products and an increase in incurred policyholder benefits related to a closed block of japan business with guaranteed benefits these declines were partially offset by reductions in deferred policy acquisition costs dac and sales inducement asset sia amortization related to

accident and health contracts recoverability of dac estimated gross profits for investment oriented products fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities other than temporary

temporary impairments aig evaluates its investments for impairment such that a security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant 25 percent or more discount to par amortized cost if lower or cost for an extended period of time nine consecutive months or longer the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or aig may not realize a full recovery on its investment regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer its near term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances the above criteria also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market valuation decline such as that experienced in current credit markets in which aig could not reasonably assert that the recovery period would be temporary severity losses for further discussion see portfolio review other than temporary impairments at each balance sheet date aig evaluates its securities holdings with unrealized losses when aig does not intend to hold such securities until they have recovered their cost basis aig records the unrealized loss in income if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date pursuant to changes in circumstances the loss is recognized in the period in which the intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer existed in periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment charge for fixed maturity securities which is not credit or foreign exchange related aig generally accretes into income the discount or amortizes the reduced premium resulting from the reduction in cost basis over the remaining life of the security fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities aig measures at fair value on a recurring basis financial instruments in its trading and available for sale securities portfolios certain mortgage and other loans receivable certain spot commodities derivative assets and liabilities securities purchased sold under agreements to resell repurchase securities lending invested collateral non marketable equity investments included in other invested assets certain policyholders contract deposits securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased certain trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors certain long term borrowings and certain hybrid financial instruments included in other liabilities the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value conversely financial instruments traded in other than active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment pricing observability is affected by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions fixed maturities trading and available for sale aig maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value whenever available aig obtains quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure at fair value fixed maturity instruments in its trading and available for sale portfolios market price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer markets aig estimates the fair value of fixed maturity instruments not traded in active markets including securities purchased sold under agreements to resell repurchase and mortgage and other loans receivable for which aig elected the fair value option by referring to traded securities with similar attributes using dealer quotations and matrix pricing methodologies or discounted cash flow analyses this methodology considers such factors as the issuers industry the securitys rating and tenor its coupon rate its position in the capital structure of the issuer yield curves credit curves prepayment rates and other relevant factors for fixed maturity instruments that are not traded in active markets or that are subject to transfer restrictions valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability and such adjustments generally are based on available market evidence in the absence of such evidence managements best estimate is used 43 american international group inc and subsidiaries equity securities traded in active markets trading and

trades the valuation of the super senior credit derivatives has become increasingly challenging given the limitation on the availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in the structured finance market particularly during and since the fourth quarter of 2007 these market conditions have increased the reliance on management estimates and judgments in arriving at an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes further disparities in the valuation methodologies employed by market participants and the varying judgments reached by such participants when assessing volatile markets has increased the likelihood that the various parties to these instruments may arrive at significantly different estimates as to their fair values aigfps valuation methodologies for the super senior credit default swap portfolio have evolved in response to the deteriorating market conditions and the lack of sufficient market observable information aig has sought to calibrate the model to market information and to review the assumptions of the model on a regular basis aigfp employs a modified version of the bet model to value its credit default swap portfolio written on the super senior securities issued by cdos including the embedded 2a 7 puts the bet model uses default probabilities derived from credit spreads implied from market prices for the

weighted average lives recovery rates and discount rates the 46 american international group inc and subsidiaries determination of some of these inputs requires the use of judgment and estimates particularly in the absence of market observable data aigfp also employs a monte carlo simulation to assist in quantifying the effect on valuation of the cdo of the unique features of the cdos structure such as triggers that divert cash flows to the most senior level of the capital structure aig selected the bet model for the following reasons data table removed aigs implementation of the bet model uses a monte carlo simulation of the cash flows of each underlying cdo for various scenarios of defaults by the underlying collateral securities the monte carlo simulation allows the model to take into account the cash flow waterfall and to capture the benefits due to cash flow diversion within each cdo the bet model has certain limitations a well known limitation of the bet model is that it can understate the expected losses for super senior tranches when default correlations are high the model uses correlations implied from diversity scores which do not capture the tendency for correlations to increase as defaults increase recognizing this concern aig tested the sensitivity of the valuations to the diversity scores the results of the testing demonstrated that the valuations are not very sensitive to the diversity scores because the expected losses generated from the prices of the collateral pool securities are currently high breaching the attachment point in most transactions once the attachment point is breached by a sufficient amount the diversity scores and their implied correlations are no longer a significant driver of the valuation of a super senior tranche the credit default swaps written by aigfp generally cover the failure of payment on the super senior cdo security aigfp does not own the securities in the cdo collateral pool the credit spreads implied from the market prices of the securities in the cdo collateral pool incorporate the risk of default credit risk the markets price for liquidity risk and in distressed markets the risk aversion costs spreads on credit derivatives tend to be narrower than the credit spreads implied from the market prices of the securities in the cdo collateral pool because unlike investing in a bond there is no need to fund the position except when an actual credit event occurs in times of illiquidity the difference between spreads on cash securities and derivative instruments the negative basis may be even wider for high quality assets aigfp was unable to reliably verify this negative basis with market observable inputs due to the accelerating severe dislocation illiquidity and lack of trading in the asset backed securities market during the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 the valuations produced by the bet model therefore represent the valuations of the underlying super senior cdo cash securities based on aigs assumptions about those securities albeit with no recognition of any potential favorable effect of the basis differential on that valuation aigfp also considered the valuation of the super senior cdo securities provided by third parties including counterparties to these transactions and made adjustments as necessary the most significant assumption used in developing the estimate is the pricing of the securities within the cdo collateral pools these prices are used to derive default probabilities that are used in the bet model if the actual pricing of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the pricing used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate a decrease by five points for example from 87 cents per dollar to 82 cents per dollar in the aggregate price of the securities would cause an additional unrealized market valuation loss of approximately 3 9 billion while an increase in the aggregate price of the securities by five points for example from 90 cents per dollar to 95 cents per dollar would reduce the unrealized market valuation loss by approximately 3 7 billion the effect on the unrealized market valuation loss is not directly proportional to the change in the aggregate price of the securities the following table presents other key inputs used in the valuation of the credit derivative portfolio written on the super senior securities issued by multi sector cdos and the

historical reporting trends mortgage guaranty establishes reserves using a percentage of the contractual liability for each delinquent loan reported that is based upon past experience regarding certain loan factors such as age of the delinquency dollar amount of the loan and type of mortgage loan because mortgage delinquencies and claims payments are affected primarily by macroeconomic events such as changes in home price appreciation interest rates and unemployment the determination of the ultimate loss cost requires a high degree of judgment aig believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans consistent with industry practice aig does not establish a reserve for insured loans that are not currently delinquent but that may become delinquent in future periods at march 31 2008 general insurance net loss reserves increased 1 22 billion from the prior year end to 70 51 billion the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced

loss expenses as of march 31 2008 while aig regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of march 31 2008 in the opinion of management such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated financial condition although it could have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the reconciliation of net loss reserves was as follows data table removed 55 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following tables summarize development favorable or unfavorable of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years other than accretion of discount data table removed amounts for 2007 have been conformed to the 2008 presentation data table removed in determining the quarterly loss development from prior accident years aig conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each profit center for example if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center as appropriate in the first three months of 2008 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the first three months of 2008 as part of its quarterly reserving process aig also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues such as those related to the u s mortgage and housing market 2008 net loss development in the first three months of 2008 net loss development from prior accident years was favorable by approximately 164 million including approximately 339 million of favorable development

both the favorable development relating to loss sensitive business and accretion of loss reserve discount net loss development from prior accident years in the first three months of 2008 was adverse by approximately 175 million the overall favorable development of 164 million consisted of approximately 572 million of favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2007 partially offset by approximately 408 million of adverse loss development from accident years 2002 and prior excluding the favorable development from loss sensitive business the overall adverse development of 175 million consisted of approximately 269 million of favorable development from accident years 2003 through 2007 offset by approximately 444 million of adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior the adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior was primarily related to excess casualty business within commercial insurance for the 2000 and prior accident years the favorable development

classes of aigs business continued to experience 56 american international group inc and subsidiaries favorable development for accident years 2003 through 2006 the adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior reflected development from excess casualty within commercial insurance and from transatlantic asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k aigs reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground up analysis in the first three months of 2008 aig maintained the ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims resulting from the recently completed reserve analyses a relatively minor amount of favorable incurred loss development pertaining to asbestos was reflected in the first three months of 2008 as presented in the table that follows this development was primarily attributable to one large settlement a summary of reserve activity including estimates for applicable ibnr relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined appears in the following table the vast majority of such claims arise from policies written in 1984 and prior years the current environmental policies that aig underwrites on a claims made basis have been excluded from the following table data table removed a gross amounts were revised from the presentation in prior periods to reflect the inclusion of certain reserves not previously identified as asbestos and environmental related this revision had no effect on net reserves b all amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years primarily to policies issued in 1984 and prior the gross and net ibnr included in the reserve for losses and loss expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were estimated as follows data table removed gross amounts were revised from the presentation in prior periods to reflect the inclusion of certain reserves not previously identified as asbestos and environmental related this revision had no effect on net reserves 57 american international group inc and subsidiaries a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity was as follows data table removed survival ratios asbestos and environmental the following table presents aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at march 31 2008 and 2007 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the march 31 2008 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at march 31 2007 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments in addition aigs survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by the favorable settlement described above as well as several similar settlements during 2007 these settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at march 31 2008 by approximately 1 6 years and 3 2 years respectively and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at march 31 2007 by approximately 1 0 year and 2 4 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aigs determination of its reserves is not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at march 31 2008 and 2007 were as follows data table removed gross amounts for 2007 were revised from the presentation

rates at march 31 2008 disruption in the u s residential mortgage and credit markets was the key driver of operating results for the first three months of 2008 primarily due to significant net realized capital losses resulting from other than temporary impairment charges of 4 4 billion compared to other than temporary impairment charges of 392 million in the same period of 2007 in addition net investment income and certain products continued to be negatively affected by the volatile markets life insurance and retirement services total revenues in the first three months of 2008 reflect growth in premiums and other considerations compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to strong life insurance production in the foreign life insurance and retirement services operations growth in a block of u k investment oriented products and higher sales of payout annuities in the domestic life insurance operations overall growth in premiums and other considerations was dampened by a continuing shift to investment oriented products and the suspension in the second quarter of 2007 of new sales on certain products in japan pending completion of an industry wide review by the tax authorities this review was finalized in march 2008 and resulted in lower tax deductibility of these products although sales of these products have restarted in japan it is expected that sales will be at lower than historical levels net investment income decreased in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to lower partnership and mutual fund income as well as lower policyholder investment income and trading gains and losses together policyholder trading gains losses reflecting equity market declines policyholder trading gains and losses are offset by a charge to incurred policy losses and benefits expense policyholder trading gains and losses generally reflect the trends in equity markets principally in japan and asia policyholder trading losses were 785 million in the first three months of 2008 compared to gains of 797 million in the same period of 2007 the operating loss in the first three months of 2008 was significantly affected by net realized capital losses which totaled 4 4 billion compared to net realized capital losses of 256 million in the same period in 2007 the higher net realized capital losses were primarily related to severity impairments and foreign exchange losses due to the credit market disruption and weakening of the dollar against asian currencies the higher net realized capital losses and lower yield enhancement investment income more than offset the positive effect of growth in underlying reserves which reflects increased assets under management other factors that negatively affected operating income in the first three months of 2008 were trading account losses of 88 million in the u k associated with certain investment linked products and an increase in incurred policyholder benefits of 80 million related to a closed block of japan business with guaranteed benefits partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates operating income in the first three months of 2008 included a

of 2007 included additional claim expense of 37 million related to the industry wide regulatory review of claims in japan and a 50 million charge related to balance sheet reconciliation remediation activities in asia 60 american international group inc and subsidiaries the most significant effect on the life insurance and retirement services results from aigs adoption of fas 157 was the change in measurement of fair value for embedded policy derivatives the pre tax effect of adoption related to embedded policy derivatives was an increase in net realized capital losses of 155 million as of january 1 2008 partially offset by a 47 million dac benefit related to these losses the effect of initial adoption was primarily due to an increase in the embedded policy derivative liability valuations resulting from the inclusion of explicit risk margins aig adopted fas 159 on january 1 2008 and elected to apply the fair value option to a closed block of single premium variable life business in japan and for an investment linked product sold principally in asia the adoption of fas 159 with respect to these fair value elections resulted in a decrease to 2008 opening retained

sold through discontinued distribution relationships total revenues and operating income for domestic retirement services declined in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to significantly increased net realized capital losses and lower partnership and yield enhancement income net realized capital losses for domestic retirement services increased primarily due to higher other than temporary impairment charges of 2 2 billion in the first three months of 2008 compared to 42 million in the same period in 2007 both group retirement products and individual fixed annuities operating income in the first three months of 2008 decreased compared to the same period in 2007 primarily as a result of increased net realized capital losses due to higher other than temporary impairment charges and lower net investment income due to lower partnership and yield enhancement income in addition increased levels of short term investments further reduced the overall investment yield these decreases were partially offset by decreases in dac amortization and sales inducement costs of 168 million related to the net realized capital losses individual variable annuities operating income decreased in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily as a result of increased net realized capital losses largely due to increased embedded policy derivative liability valuations primarily as a result of the adoption of fas 157 as well as higher other than temporary impairment charges the increase in net realized capital losses was partially offset by decreases in dac amortization and sales inducement costs of 77 million related to the net realized capital losses 67 american international group inc and subsidiaries the account value rollforward for domestic retirement services by product was as follows data table removed higher deposits in the individual fixed annuity blocks in combination with lower surrenders in all product lines resulted in positive net flows in the first three months of 2008 domestic retirement services deposits increased in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily reflecting higher deposits in individual fixed annuities group retirement and individual variable annuity deposits were essentially unchanged in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the significant improvement in individual fixed annuity sales was due to continued steepening of the yield curve and mutual fund money market products offering less competitive crediting rates than those currently available on fixed annuities domestic retirement services surrenders and other withdrawals decreased in all product lines in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 group retirement surrenders decreased in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 as a result of a few large group mutual fund surrenders in the first three months of 2007 individual fixed annuity surrenders decreased in the first three months of 2008 due to decreasing competition from bank deposit and mutual fund money market products domestic retirement services reserves by surrender charge category and surrender rates were as follows data table removed excludes mutual funds of 8 1 billion and 6 9 billion at march 31 2008 and 2007 respectively surrender rates decreased for all three product lines in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the surrender rate for individual fixed annuities continues to be driven by the yield curve and the general aging of the in force block however less than 23 percent of the individual fixed annuity reserves as of march 31 2008 were available for surrender without charge an increase in the level of surrenders in any of these businesses or in the individual fixed annuities runoff block could accelerate the amortization of dac and negatively affect fee income

recorded 4 4 billion of other than temporary impairment charges compared to 392 million in the same period in 2007 the increased other than temporary foreign life insurance and retirement services losses were primarily driven by severity losses and foreign currency declines see invested assets valuation of invested assets portfolio review herein for further information foreign currency losses of 401 million related primarily to the decline in value of u s dollar bonds held in taiwan singapore and thailand against those respective currencies derivatives in the foreign life insurance and retirement services operations are primarily used to economically hedge cash flows related to u s dollar bonds back to the respective currency of the country principally in taiwan thailand and singapore these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 and are recorded in net realized capital gains losses the corresponding foreign exchange gain or loss with respect to the economically hedged bond is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the bond is sold or deemed to be other than temporarily impaired in the first three months of

net realized capital gains losses the corresponding gain or loss with respect to the economically hedged bond is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the bond is sold matures or deemed to be other than temporarily impaired the most significant effect of aigs adoption of fas 157 was the change in measurement of fair value for embedded policy derivatives the pre tax effect of adoption related to embedded policy derivatives was an increase in net realized capital losses of 155 million as of january 1 2008 the effect of initial adoption was primarily due to an increase in the embedded policy derivative liability valuations resulting from the inclusion of explicit risk margins deferred policy acquisition costs and sales inducement assets dac for life insurance and retirement services products arises from the deferral of costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new or renewal business policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period in accordance with fas 60 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises fas 60 policy acquisition costs that relate to universal life and investment type products are generally deferred and amortized with interest in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the

the business similar to dac aig offers sales inducements to contract holders bonus interest on certain annuity and investment contracts sales inducements are recognized as part of the liability for policyholders contract deposits on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the life of the contract similar to dac total deferred acquisition and sales inducement costs increased 186 million in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to higher production in the foreign life insurance operations partially offset by lower domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services sales total amortization expense decreased slightly in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the amortization in 2008 was reduced by the adoption of fas 159 and 267 million credited to operating income related to net realized capital losses in the first three months of 2008 compared to 11 million in the same period of 2007 reflecting significantly higher other than temporary impairment charges as a result annualized amortization expense levels in the first three months of 2008 and 2007 were approximately 11 percent and 13 percent respectively of the opening dac balance aig adopted fas 159 on january 1 2008 and elected to apply fair value accounting for an investment linked product sold principally in asia upon fair value election all dac and sia are written off and there is no further deferral or amortization of dac and sia for that product the amount of dac and sia written off as of january 1 2008 was 1 1 billion and 299 million respectively 71 american international group inc and subsidiaries the major components of the changes in dac voba and sia were as follows data table removed in 2008 primarily represents the cumulative effect of adoption of fas 159 in 2007 primarily represents the cumulative effect of adoption of sop 05 1 because aig operates in various global markets the estimated gross profits used to amortize dac voba and sia can be subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period the combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and regions and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products and regions dac voba and sia for insurance oriented investment oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability which involves estimating the 72 american international group inc and subsidiaries future profitability of current business this review involves significant management judgment if actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated aigs dac voba and sia may be subject to an impairment charge and aigs results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods future policy benefit reserves periodically the net benefit reserves policy benefit reserves less dac established for life insurance and retirement services companies are tested to ensure that including consideration of future expected premium payments they are adequate to provide for future policyholder benefit obligations the assumptions used to perform the tests are current best estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality morbidity terminations company maintenance expenses and invested asset returns for long duration traditional business a lock in principle applies whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and dac are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience these assumptions include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions for business in force outside of north america 46 percent of total policyholder benefit liabilities at march 31 2008 represent traditional business where the lock in principle applies in most foreign locations various guarantees are embedded in policies in force that may remain applicable for many decades into the future as experience changes over time the best estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes because of the long term nature of many of aigs liabilities subject to the lock in principle small changes in certain of the assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy in particular changes in estimates of future invested asset return assumptions have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy taiwan beginning in 2000 the yield available on taiwanese 10 year government bonds dropped from approximately 6 percent to 2 4 percent at march 31 2008 yields on most other invested assets have correspondingly dropped over the same period current sales are focused on products such as data table removed in developing the reserve adequacy analysis for nan shan several key best estimate assumptions have been made observed historical mortality improvement trends have been projected to 2014 morbidity expense and termination rates have been updated to reflect recent experience taiwan government bond rates are expected to remain at current levels for 10 years and gradually increase to best estimate assumptions of a market consensus view of long term interest rate expectations foreign assets are assumed to comprise 35 percent of invested assets resulting in a composite long term investment assumption of approximately 4 8 percent and the currently permitted practice of offsetting positive mortality experience with negative interest margins thus eliminating the need for mortality dividends will continue future results of the reserve adequacy tests will involve significant management judgment as to mortality morbidity expense and termination rates and investment yields adverse changes in these assumptions could accelerate dac amortization and necessitate reserve strengthening 73 american international group inc and subsidiaries financial services operations aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing capital markets consumer finance and insurance premium finance financial services results financial services results were as follows data table removed a revenues shown net of interest expense of 511 million and 1 1 billion in the three month periods ended march 31 2008 and 2007

million in connection with domestic consumer finances mortgage banking activities financial services reported an operating loss in the first three months of 2008 compared to operating income in the same period of 2007 primarily due to an unrealized market valuation loss of 9 1 billion on aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio and a decline in operating income for agf agfs operating income declined in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to increases in the provision for finance receivable losses and unfavorable variances related to derivatives ilfc generated strong operating income growth in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 driven to a large extent by a larger aircraft fleet higher lease rates and higher utilization aircraft leasing aircraft leasing operations represent the operations of ilfc which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial aircraft for ilfcs own account and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and financial institutions ilfc finances its aircraft purchases primarily through the issuance of debt instruments ilfc economically hedges part of its floating rate and substantially all of its foreign currency denominated debt using interest rate and foreign currency derivatives starting in the second quarter of 2007 ilfc began applying hedge accounting to most of its derivatives the composite borrowing rates at march 31 2008 and 2007 were 4 79 percent and 5 19 percent respectively ilfc typically contracts to re lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term for aircraft returned before the end of the lease term ilfc has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to six months of their return as a lessor ilfc considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent subsequent to march 31 2008 thirteen planes were returned to ilfc by bankrupt lessees ilfc expects to re lease these planes to other lessees and may incur related costs as of april 30 2008 ilfc had leased 10 of the thirteen aircraft aircraft leasing results ilfcs operating income increased in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 rental revenues increased by 121 million or 11 percent driven by a larger aircraft fleet and higher lease rates as of march 31 2008 921 aircraft in ilfcs fleet were subject to operating

marketing revenues increased by 8 million in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to an increase in aircraft sales the increase in revenues was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and a credit value adjustment on derivatives as a result of the adoption of fas 157 depreciation expense increased by 44 million or 11 percent in line with the increase in the size of the aircraft fleet in the first three months of 2008 and 2007 the losses from hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under 74 american international group inc and subsidiaries fas 133 including the related foreign exchange gains and losses were 48 million and 37 million respectively in both revenues and operating income the net derivative loss for the three

capital markets represents the operations of aigfp which engages as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions including standard and customized financial products involving commodities credit currencies energy equities and rates the credit products include credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt

capital markets operations derive a significant portion of their revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions aigfp also participates as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions revenues and operating income of the capital markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are significantly affected by changes in the fair value of aigfps assets and liabilities and by the number size and profitability of transactions entered into during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period generally the realization of transaction revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on aigfps trading transactions is currently reflected in operating income as the fair values change from period to period aigfps products generally require sophisticated models and significant management assumptions to determine fair values and particularly during times of market disruption the absence of observable market data can result in fair values at any given balance sheet date that are not indicative of the ultimate settlement values of the products capital markets results capital markets reported an operating loss in the first three months of 2008 compared to operating income in the same period of 2007 primarily due to unrealized market valuation losses related to aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio principally written on multi sector cdos these losses were partially offset by net unrealized market gains related to certain credit default swaps purchased against the aaa to bbb rated risk layers on portfolios of reference obligations financial market conditions in the first three months of 2008 were characterized by widening credit spreads and declining interest rates in addition to writing credit protection on the super senior risk layer on designated portfolios of loans or debt securities aigfp also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer at march 31 2008 the net notional amount of the credit default swaps in the regulatory capital relief

reference obligations that include multi sector cdo obligations during the first three months of 2008 unrealized market valuation gains of 130 million on the related credit default swaps and embedded credit derivatives in credit linked notes were fully offset by the fair value adjustment on the underlying assets the change in fair value of aigfps credit default swaps was caused by the significant widening in spreads in the first quarter of 2008 driven by the credit concerns resulting from u s residential mortgages the severe liquidity crisis affecting the markets and the effects of rating agency downgrades on structured securities based upon its most current analyses aig believes that any credit impairment losses which may emerge over time at aigfp will not be material to aigs consolidated financial condition but could be material to the manner in which aig manages its liquidity the net loss recognized for the first three months of 2007 included a 166 million reduction in fair value of 75 american international group inc and subsidiaries certain derivatives that are an integral part of and economically hedge the structured transactions potentially affected by the proposed guidance by the u s treasury department affecting the ability to claim foreign tax credits the most significant component of capital markets operating expenses is compensation which was approximately 143 million and 123 million in the first three months of 2008 and 2007 respectively the amount of compensation was not affected by gains and losses arising from derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 in the first quarter of 2008 aigfp established an employee retention plan which guarantees a broad group of aigfps employees and consultants a minimum level of compensation for each of the 2008 and 2009 compensation years subject to mandatory partial deferral which in certain circumstances will be indexed to the price of aig stock the deferred amounts may be reduced in the event of losses prior to payment the expense related to the plan is being recognized over the vesting period beginning in the first quarter of 2008 effective january 1 2008 aigfp adopted fas 157 the most significant effect of adopting fas 157 was a change in the valuation methodologies for hybrid financial instruments and derivative liabilities both freestanding and embedded historically carried at fair value the changes were primarily to incorporate aigfps own credit risk when appropriate in the fair value measurements effective january 1 2008 aigfp also elected to apply the fair value option to all eligible assets and liabilities other than equity method investments and trade receivables and trade payables electing the fair value option allows aigfp to more closely align its earnings with the economics of its transactions by recognizing the change in fair value of its derivatives and the offsetting change in fair value of the assets and liabilities being hedged concurrently through earnings capital markets net operating loss for the first three months of 2008 includes an increase to pre tax earnings of 2 648 million attributable to changes in aigs credit spreads which were substantially offset by the effect of changes in counterparty credit spreads on assets measured at fair value of 2 620 million included in the first

market gains on interest rate and foreign exchange hedges the other than temporary impairment charges on fixed income investments held in the gic and mip portfolios were 539 million for the gic and 494 million for the mip for the first three months of 2008 and resulted from widening credit spreads and decreased market liquidity see invested assets portfolio review other than temporary impairments in addition to the other than temporary impairments unrealized losses on fixed maturity investments were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and were driven by widening credit spreads and decreased market liquidity partially offset by gains resulting from falling interest rates in the gic program income from partnership investments was 45 million for the first three months of 2008 a decline of 417 million from the same period of 2007 due to significantly higher performance in the first three months of 2007 also contributing to the decline was the one time distribution from a single partnership of 164 million in the first three months of 2007 foreign exchange losses on foreign denominated gic reserves increased by 297 million in the first three months of 2008 as a result of the continued weakening of the u s dollar as noted below a significant portion of these gic reserves will mature in 2008 partially offsetting the decline in partnership income and increased foreign exchange losses was an increase in mark to market gains on derivative positions of 479 million these gains included mark to market gains on interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives used to economically hedge the effect of interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements on gic reserves although these economic hedges are partially effective in hedging the interest rate and foreign exchange risk they did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment the mip experienced mark to market losses of 324 million due primarily to interest rate and foreign exchange derivative positions that while partially effective in hedging interest rate and foreign exchange risk did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and an additional 131 million in mark to market losses were recognized due to credit default swap investments the mip credit default swaps are comprised predominantly of single name high grade corporate exposures the mark to market losses for the first three months of 2008 were driven primarily by a decline in short term interest rates the decline in value of the u s dollar and widening credit spreads aig enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate the effect of changes in currency and interest rates associated with the fixed and floating rate and foreign currency denominated obligations issued under these programs some of these hedging relationships qualify for hedge accounting treatment while others do not income or loss from these hedges not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment are classified as net realized capital gains losses in aigs consolidated statement of income loss aig did not issue any additional debt to fund the mip in the first three months of 2008 through march 31 2008 the mip had cumulative debt issuances

expense due to additional real estate investments acquired in late 2007 aig recognizes carried 79 american international group inc and subsidiaries interest revenues on an unrealized basis by reflecting the amount owed to aig as of the balance sheet date based on the related funds performance also contributing to this decrease were the operating losses of certain consolidated warehoused private equity investments the reduction in these revenues is due to significantly higher fund performance in the first three months of 2007 the consolidated warehoused private equity investments are not wholly owned by aig and thus a significant portion of the effect of consolidating these operating losses is offset in minority interest which is not a component of operating income slightly offsetting these decreases were higher base management fees driven by an increase of approximately 15 billion in unaffiliated client assets under management aigs unaffiliated client assets under management including retail mutual funds and institutional accounts were 91 4 billion at march 31 2008 a decline of 3 percent compared to december 31 2007 and an increase of 19 percent compared to 76 5 billion at march 31 2007 the decline from december 31 2007 primarily reflected market valuation declines in the equity and fixed income markets the increase from march 31 2007 was driven by new business other asset management results revenues and operating income related to the other asset management activities decreased in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007

expenses related to efforts to improve internal controls corporate initiatives and certain compensation plan expenses the operating loss of aigs other category increased in the first three months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 reflecting higher interest expense that resulted from increased borrowings and higher net realized capital losses partially offset by lower unallocated corporate expenses the increase in net realized capital losses reflected higher foreign exchange losses on foreign denominated debt a portion of which was economically hedged but did not qualify for

impairments aig assesses its ability to hold any fixed maturity security in an unrealized loss position to its recovery including fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale at each balance sheet date the decision to sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflects the judgment of aigs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale aig evaluates its investments for impairments in valuation the determination that a security has

usually smaller than the sum of its components due to correlation effects data table removed credit derivatives aigfp enters into credit derivative transactions in the ordinary course of its business the majority of aigfps credit derivatives require aigfp to provide credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities aigfp provides such credit protection on a second loss basis under which aigfps payment obligations arise only after credit losses in the designated portfolio exceed a specified threshold amount or level of first losses the threshold amount of credit losses that must be realized before aigfp has any payment obligation is negotiated by aigfp for each transaction to provide that the likelihood of any payment obligation by aigfp under each transaction is remote even in severe recessionary market scenarios the underwriting process for these derivatives included assumptions of severely stressed recessionary market scenarios to minimize the likelihood of realized losses under these obligations in certain cases the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio is tranched into different layers of risk which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies typically there will be an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio and then successive layers ranging from generally a bbb rated layer to one or more aaa rated layers in transactions that are rated with respect to the risk layer or tranche that is immediately junior to the threshold level above which aigfps payment obligation would generally arise a significant majority are rated aaa by the rating agencies in transactions that are not rated aigfp applies the same risk criteria for setting the threshold level for its payment obligations therefore the risk layer assumed by aigfp with respect to the designated portfolio in these transactions is often called the super senior risk layer defined as the layer of credit risk senior to a risk layer that has been rated aaa by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated equivalent thereto approximately 335 billion consisting of corporate loans and prime residential mortgages of the 469 billion in notional exposure of aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio as of march 31 2008 represented derivatives written for financial institutions principally in europe for the purpose of providing regulatory capital relief rather than risk mitigation in exchange for a minimum guaranteed fee the counterparties receive credit protection with respect to diversified loan portfolios they own thus improving their regulatory capital position these derivatives are generally expected to terminate at no additional cost to the counterparty upon the counterpartys adoption of models compliant with the basel ii accord aig expects that the majority of these transactions will be terminated within the next 12 to 24 months by aigfps counterparties as they implement those models as of april 30 2008 55 billion in notional exposures have either been terminated or are in the process of being terminated in its 2007 annual report on form 10 k aig had previously reported that as of february 26 2008 54 billion in notional exposures have either been terminated or are in the process of being terminated aig has recently refined its approach to estimating its net notional exposures on certain of these transactions that have unique features the notional exposures on transactions terminated or that were in the process of being terminated as of february 26 2008 is 46 billion under the refined method aigfp was not required to make any payments as part of these terminations and in certain cases was paid a fee upon termination in light of this experience to date and after other comprehensive analyses aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the three months ended march 31 2008 aig will continue to assess the valuation of this portfolio and monitor developments in the marketplace given the significant deterioration in the credit markets and the risk that aigfps expectations with respect to the termination of these transactions by its counterparties may not materialize there can be no assurance that aig will not recognize unrealized market valuation losses from this portfolio in future periods and recognition of even a small percentage decline in the fair value of this portfolio could be material to an individual reporting period 101 american international group inc and subsidiaries approximately 57 billion of the 469 billion in notional exposure on aigfps super senior credit default swaps as of march 31 2008 was written on investment grade corporate debt and clos there is no uniform methodology to estimate the fair value of corporate super senior credit default swaps aig estimates the fair value of its corporate credit default swap portfolio by reference to benchmark indices including the cdx and itraxx and third party prices and collateral calls aig believes that its methodology to value the corporate credit default swap portfolio is reasonable but other market participants use other methodologies and these methodologies may generate materially different fair value estimates no assurance can be given that the fair value of aigs corporate credit default swap portfolio would not change materially if other market indices or pricing sources were used to estimate the fair value of the portfolio in addition to writing credit protection on the super senior risk layer on designated portfolios of loans or debt securities aigfp also wrote protection on tranches below the super senior risk layer at march 31 2008 the notional amount of the credit default swaps in the regulatory capital relief portfolio written on tranches below the super senior risk layer was 5 7 billion with an estimated fair value loss of 174 million aigfp has also written credit protection on the super senior risk layer of diversified portfolios of investment grade corporate debt clos and multi sector cdos aigfp is at risk only on the super senior portion related to a diversified portfolio referenced to loans or debt securities the super senior risk portion is the last tranche to suffer losses after significant subordination credit losses would have to erode all tranches junior to the super senior tranche before aigfp would suffer any realized losses the subordination level required for each transaction is determined based on internal modeling and analysis of the pool of underlying assets and is not dependent on ratings determined by the rating agencies while the credit default swaps written on corporate debt obligations are cash settled the majority of the credit default swaps written on cdos and clos require physical settlement under a physical settlement arrangement aigfp would be required to purchase the referenced super senior security at par in the event of a non payment on that security certain of the aigfp credit default swaps with an aggregate notional amount totaling 8 7 billion protect cdos that include over collateralization provisions that adjust the value of the collateral based in part on the ratings of the collateral for the cdos if the over collateralization provisions are not satisfied an event of default would occur creating a right to accelerate in certain of these circumstances aigfp may be required to purchase the referenced super senior security at par upon the acceleration of the security aigfp cannot currently quantify its obligations which might occur in the future under these provisions or determine the timing of any purchases that might be required therefore there can be no assurance that satisfaction of these obligations by aigfp will not have a material effect on the manner in which aig manages its liquidity aigfp has written 2a 7 puts in connection with certain multi sector cdos that allow the holders of the securities to treat the securities as eligible short term 2a 7 investments under the investment company act of 1940 holders of securities are permitted in certain circumstances to tender their securities to the issuers at par if an issuers remarketing agent is unable to resell the securities so tendered aigfp must purchase the securities at par as long as the security has not experienced a default during the first three months of 2008 aigfp repurchased securities with a principal amount of approximately 235 million in connection with these obligations in certain transactions aigfp has contracted with third parties to provide liquidity for the securities if they are put to aigfp for up to a three year period such liquidity facilities totaled 2 6 billion at march 31 2008 as of april 30 2008 aigfp has utilized less than 200 million of these liquidity facilities at april 30 2008 aigfp had 5 7 billion of notional exposure on 2a 7 puts included as part of the multi sector cdo portfolio discussed herein as of april 30 2008 a significant majority of aigfps super senior exposures continued to have tranches below aigfps attachment point that have been explicitly rated aaa or in aigfps judgment would have been rated aaa had they been rated aigfps portfolio of credit default swaps undergoes regular monitoring modeling and analysis and contains protection through collateral subordination certain of these credit derivatives are subject to collateral posting provisions these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes in the case of most of the multi sector cdo transactions the amount of collateral required is determined based on the change in value of the underlying cash security that represents the super senior risk layer subject to credit protection and not the change in value of the super senior credit derivative as of april 30 2008 aigfp had received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps including those entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and those in respect of corporate debt clos at times valuation estimates made by certain of the counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference cdo securities for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by aigfp in connection with such instruments have differed significantly from aigfps estimates in almost all cases aigfp has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation such that collateral posting levels are not currently the subject of ongoing negotiations including in certain cases entering into compromise collateral arrange 102 american international group inc and subsidiaries ments some of which are for specified periods of time aigfp is currently in active discussions with a small number of other counterparties to resolve such valuation differences as of april 30 2008 aigfp had posted collateral or had received collateral where offsetting exposures on other transactions resulted in the counterparty posting to aigfp based on exposures calculated in respect of super senior credit default swaps in an aggregate net amount of 9 7 billion valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes were considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio aig has conducted risk analyses of the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio of aigfp aigs analyses have been conducted to assess the risk of incurring net realized losses over the remaining life of the portfolio in addition to analyses of each individual risk in the portfolio aig conducted certain ratings based stress tests which centered around scenarios of further stress on the portfolio resulting from downgrades by the rating agencies from current levels on the underlying collateral in the cdo structures supported by aigfps credit default swaps these rating actions would be prompted by factors such as the worsening beyond current estimates of delinquency and residential housing price deterioration in the underlying assets in the collateral securities of the cdo structures the results of these stress tests indicated possible realized losses on a static basis because the assumptions of losses in these stress tests assumed immediate realization of loss actual realized losses would only be experienced over time given the timing of losses incurred in the underlying portfolios and the timing of breaches of the subordination afforded to aigfp through the structures of the cdo no benefit was taken in these stress tests for cash flow diversion features recoveries upon default or other risk mitigant benefits during the first quarter of 2008 aig developed an additional methodology to estimate its potential realized credit impairment losses from aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the methodology combines a roll rate estimate of the losses emanating from the subprime and alt a rmbs collateral securities in the multi sector cdos plus an estimate of losses arising from the cdos inside the collateral pools inner cdos in the roll rate analysis default rates on mortgages in various stages of delinquency 30 days past due 60 days past due 90 days past due bankruptcy or foreclosure real estate owned are projected out at various rates called roll rates to estimate total potential defaults loss severities are then applied to the defaults to estimate realized credit impairment losses in addition loss timing curves to the performing mortgages are also applied to estimate how much of the non delinquent portfolio is likely to default given mortgage seasoning age of the mortgage finally aig applies loss estimates to the inner cdos using inner cdo loss estimates that depend on the vintage type high grade and mezzanine and rating of the cdo item 3 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
