measures use of non gaap measures throughout this md and a we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results some of the measurements we use are nongaap financial measures under securities and exchange commission rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the nongaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarlynamed measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and book value per common share excluding aoci and deferred tax assets dta adjusted book value per common share are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full year attribute utilization as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci and dta adjusted shareholders equity by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a return on equity after tax operating income excluding aoci and dta adjusted return on equity is used to show the rate of return on shareholders equity we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio foreign currency translation adjustments and u s tax attribute deferred tax assets this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities we exclude deferred tax assets representing u s tax attributes related to net operating

carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on equity adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized after tax operating income attributable to aig by average adjusted shareholders equity the reconciliation to return on equity the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive summary section of this md and a after tax operating income attributable to aig is derived by excluding the tax effected pre tax operating income ptoi adjustments described below and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges and uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance general operating expenses operating basis is derived by making the following adjustments to general operating and other expenses include i certain loss adjustment expenses reported as policyholder benefits and losses incurred and ii certain investment and other expenses reported as net investment income and exclude i advisory fee expenses ii non deferrable insurance commissions iii direct marketing and acquisition expenses net of deferrals iv non operating litigation reserves and v other expense related to an asbestos retroactive reinsurance agreement we use general operating expenses operating basis because we believe it provides a more meaningful indication of our ordinary course of business operating costs regardless of within which financial statement line item these expenses are reported externally within our segment results the majority of these expenses are employee related costs for example other acquisition expenses and losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily represent employee related costs in the underwriting and claims functions respectively excluded from this measure are non operating expenses such as restructuring costs and litigation reserves direct marketing expenses insurance company assessments and non deferrable commissions aig third quarter 2017 form 10 q 73 table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the consolidated results of operations section of this md and a operating revenues exclude net realized capital gains losses income from non operating litigation settlements included in other income for gaap purposes and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits included in net investment income for gaap purposes operating revenues is a gaap measure for our operating segments pre tax operating income is derived by excluding the following items from income from continuing operations before income tax this definition is consistent across our modules including geography these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions and measures that we believe to be common to the industry ptoi is a gaap measure for our operating segments data table removed commercial insurance liability and financial lines property and special risks consumer insurance personal insurance ratios we along with most property and casualty insurance companies use the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses which for commercial insurance excludes net loss reserve discount and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums prior year development net of premium adjustments and the impact of reserve discounting natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on aig in excess of 10 million each catastrophes also include certain man made events such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the 10 million threshold we believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of managements control we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results consumer insurance individual retirement group retirement and life insurance other operations institutional markets premiums and deposits includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies group benefit policies and lifecontingent

exchange rates credit and equity market conditions catastrophic claims events regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continued to operate under difficult market conditions in the first nine months of 2017 characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates the department of labors the dol final fiduciary duty rule the dol fiduciary rule volatile energy markets slowing growth in china and euro zone economies and the formal commencement of the united kingdoms the uk withdrawal from its membership in the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit brexit has also affected the u s dollar british pound exchange rate and increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro british pound and the japanese yen the major currencies which may continue for some time impact of changes in the interest rate environment interest rates decreased marginally in the first nine months of 2017 and have remained at historically low levels certain markets in which we operate have experienced negative interest rates a sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset liability management including spread management strategies for our investment oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities annuity sales and surrenders the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on investment returns which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products however our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads as long as the low interest rate environment continues conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales but may also drive higher surrenders customers are however currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment in addition older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio we will closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for guaranteed products with income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio aig third quarter 2017 form 10 q 82 table of contents item 2 executive summary reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets including the level of interest rates credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in force business business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment the low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity in addition there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain inforce business specifically the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the assetliability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability for additional information on our investment and asset liability management strategies see investments for investment oriented products in our individual retirement group retirement life insurance and institutional markets businesses our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads using asset liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees we will continue to adjust crediting rates on in force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment contractual minimum crediting rates and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre established intervals for example competitors including private equity held annuity writers are currently offering higher crediting rates as a result the timing and extent of crediting rate decreases may differ from the corresponding declines in investment yields which could reduce our spreads and future profitability of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products 73 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at september 30 2017 the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 70 percent at both september 30 2017 and december 31 2016 these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the core universal life business in our life insurance business 71 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at september 30 2017 aig third quarter 2017 form 10 q 83 table of contents item 2 executive summary the following table presents fixed annuity and universal life account values of our core individual retirement group retirement and life insurance businesses by contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate and current crediting rates data table removed individual retirement and group retirement amounts shown include fixed options within variable annuity products assumption updates and loss recognition spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize dac and related reserves for investment oriented products if future profit assumptions change significantly we may be required to recalculate dac and related reserves and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income in addition to investment oriented products certain traditional long duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates such as payout annuities are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment see insurance reserves life and annuity reserves and dac update of actuarial assumptions for discussion of such adjustments recorded in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2017 and 2016 in our consumer insurance and legacy life insurance run off lines commercial insurance the impact of low interest rates on our commercial insurance segment is primarily on our long tail casualty line of business we expect limited impacts on our existing long tail casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities we do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long tail casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates however we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection aig third quarter 2017 form 10 q 84 table of contents item 2 executive summary in addition for our commercial insurance segment and run off insurance lines reported within the legacy portfolio sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers compensation and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves additionally sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense department of labor fiduciary rule our individual retirement and group retirement operating segments provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to restrictions imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa and the internal revenue code including the requirements of the dol fiduciary rule related exemption amendments and subsequent interpretative guidance and bulletins overall the dol fiduciary rule as currently promulgated would result in increased compliance costs and may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances including class actions following the extension of the applicability dates of the dol fiduciary rule and related exemptions announced by the dol in april 2017 the new definition of fiduciary and the impartial conduct standards under the dol fiduciary rule became applicable on june 9 2017 with the remaining provisions of the rule scheduled to become applicable on january 1 2018 in late august 2017 the dol issued a proposed rule to further extend the applicability date of all remaining elements of the dol fiduciary rule and related exemptions from january 1 2018 to july 1 2019 the comment period for this proposed rule ended on september 15 2017 the delay announced in april 2017 and the current proposed delay in the applicability of the dol fiduciary rule followed a february 3 2017 presidential memorandum that directed the dol to review the rule and determine whether the dol fiduciary rule will adversely impact the ability of retirement savers to access retirement information and financial advice continued uncertainties in the annuity market around the impact and implementation of this rule including potential delays and possible modifications have continued to significantly affect distributors negatively impacting industry sales of annuity products including those offered by individual retirement we believe based on our understanding of the dol fiduciary rule that we have implemented the adjustments necessary to achieve compliance with the applicable provisions of the rule in addition to the re examination of the dol fiduciary rule other federal and state level authorities have also initiated efforts to evaluate standards of conduct for investment advice and to impose fiduciary duties on financial advisers who give such advice while we cannot yet predict what impact these developments will have on our businesses we are closely following the dols ongoing review and assessment of the dol fiduciary rule as well as these other federal and state level developments impact of currency volatility currency volatility remains acute such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations in particular growth trends in net premiums written reported in u s dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies the net effect on underwriting results however is significantly mitigated as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected these currencies may continue to fluctuate in either direction especially as a result of the uks announced exit from the eu and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written

impacting both our commercial insurance and personal insurance businesses these losses will be reflected in our fourth quarter 2017 results this preliminary estimate involves the exercise of

fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged we expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the property casualty insurance companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current riskreturn and tax objectives in addition the property casualty insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of

companies fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified high quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that to the extent practicable complements the characteristics of liabilities including duration which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities and as a result certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial

loss development in the three month period ended september 30 2017 we recognized unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of 836 million this unfavorable development was primarily a result of the following higher than expected losses for european casualty and financial lines we observed a significant increase in large claims activity in our european long tail business primarily emanating from accident years 2015 and 2016 unfavorable development in u s other casualty commercial auto loss experience for accident year 2016 has been emerging higher than expected driven by an increase in the frequency of large claims while we observed this trend in loss severity for several quarters the rate of growth continues to exceed our revised expectations we have similarly strengthened our estimate for primary general liability in consideration of similar underlying severity trends unfavorable development in u s excess casualty this was driven by emerging loss experience in accident year 2016 the loss frequency and severity to date has exceeded initial expectations and is coinciding with increased loss severity in the underlying primary auto and general liability segments higher than expected losses in property and special risks we have observed unfavorable results in u s programs commercial auto business in accident years 2015 and 2016 primarily from terminated programs along with some individual severe loss experience in aviation and surety this was partially offset by favorable development in commercial property in the nine month period ended september 30 2017 we recognized unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of 902 million primarily due to the impact of the factors noted above in the third quarter in addition during the second quarter we observed unfavorable claim experience in the u s primary general liability and u s excess casualty segments notably due to construction defects and multi year construction projects that cover all contractors on the site wrap business the majority of this activity came from accident years 2015 and prior including a significant proportion from accident years 2006 and prior we also observed higher than expected losses in property and special risks driven by unexpected development on several large international claims including aviation marine and trade credit primarily from accident year 2016 in addition in the first quarter of 2017 we increased our loss reserves by 102 million as a result of the decision made by the uk ministry of justice to reduce the discount rate applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts known as the ogden rate to negative 0 75 percent our carried reserves at december 31 2016 were estimated using our assumption that the ogden rate would decline to 1 0 percent this discount rate change primarily impacted the europe casualty and financial lines these prior year loss reserve increases were partially offset by the recognition of the amortization of the

respectively primarily in u s programs business and u s workers compensation the u s programs unfavorable prior year development was driven by higher than expected loss emergence in the most recent calendar year emanating from terminated programs the increase in our u s workers compensation loss reserves of approximately 100 million resulted from two separate rulings issued by the florida supreme court that increased the potential liability for workers compensation claims in that state by reversing certain aspects of regulations in place since 2003 also in the second quarter of 2016 the florida court of appeals issued the miles decision declaring unconstitutional certain restrictions on claimant paid attorney fees we are continuing to monitor the impact of these decisions and may

embedded derivatives measured at fair value the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates equity prices credit spreads market volatility policyholder behavior and other factors in addition to risk mitigating features in our variable annuity product design we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb

features see part ii item 7 md and a enterprise risk management insurance risks life insurance companies key insurance risks variable annuity risk management and hedging programs in our 2016 annual report differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders the economic hedge target differs from the u s gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivatives primarily due to the following the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations the u s gaap valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for u s gaap valuation such as margins for policyholder behavior mortality and volatility and the economic hedge target excludes the non performance or own credit risk adjustment used in the u s gaap valuation which reflects a market participants view of our claims paying ability by incorporating an additional spread the npa spread to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements because the discount rate includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margins the u s gaap valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors and to changes from actuarial assumption updates than the economic hedge target the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program the life insurance companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns which may be either positive or negative realized volatility versus implied volatility actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging particularly policyholder behavior and risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge the following table presents a reconciliation between the fair value of the u s gaap embedded derivatives and the value of our economic hedge target data table

are excluded from pre tax operating income of individual retirement and group retirement the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target the u s gaap embedded derivatives and changes in the fair value of the hedging portfolio as discussed above when corporate credit spreads widen the change in the npa spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a gain and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a loss in addition to changes driven by credit market related movements in the npa spread the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits the following

no impact on pre tax income loss and are not considered material to previously issued financial statements the net impact on pre tax income from the gmwb and related hedges in the three and nine month

by the related hedging portfolio however in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2016 the change in fair value of the hedging portfolio were more than offset by losses from the change in fair value of embedded derivatives excluding update of actuarial assumptions and npa primarily due to changes in interest rates which impacted the embedded derivative liability excluding npa more than the related impact to the hedging portfolio fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a u s gaap basis due to the npa and other risk margins used for u s gaap valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio on an economic basis the changes

market risk drivers equity and commodity prices residential and commercial real estate values interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange inflation and their levels of volatility we are engaged in a variety of insurance investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk directly and indirectly we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on and off balance sheet exposures the chief risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks then ensuring that they are appropriately measured monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the chief market risk officer cmro the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner

structured securities with underlying assets that include residential commercial mortgages trusts that include residential commercial real estate and or mortgages residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments interest rates interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors conversely higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons however when rates rise quickly there can be a temporary asymmetric gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value which is largely reported in other comprehensive income and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities financial liabilities insurance

comparable duration defaultfree instrument changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including but not limited to corporate bonds abs mortgage backed securities aig issued debt obligations credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments much like higher interest rates wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the longterm in the short term quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities which is largely reported in other comprehensive income a precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the creditworthiness of bond obligors potentially resulting in default losses foreign exchange fx rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with income assets and liabilities denominated in and capital deployed in a variety of currencies changes in fx rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of

through medical costs or wage levels risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures at the firmwide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aigs risk appetite statement this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels at the market risk level the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis in addition we continue to use enhanced economic gaap accounting and statutory capitalbased risk measures at the market risk level businessunit level and firmwide levels this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures aig third quarter 2017 form 10 q 170 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management we use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure including examples include sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities and a one percent increase in prices of equity securities scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in worldwide equity markets scenarios may also utilize a stochastic framework to arrive at a probability distribution of losses stress

the risk based capital rbc model law promulgated by the naic which allows states to act upon the results of rbc calculations and provides four incremental levels of regulatory action regarding insurers whose rbc calculations fall below specific thresholds those levels of action range from the requirement to submit a plan describing how an insurer would regain a specified rbc ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company the rbc formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurers statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business and computes a risk adjusted surplus level by applying discrete factors to various asset premium reserve and other financial statement items these factors are developed to be risk sensitive so that higher factors are applied to items exposed to greater risk the statutory surplus of each of our u s based insurance companies exceeded rbc minimum required levels as of december 31 2016 if any of our insurance entities

serious threat to policyholder protection or financial stability in such host state the host supervisor may request further information from the insurance group and or impose preventive or corrective measures with respect to the re insurer in its jurisdiction the agreement also seeks to impose equal treatment of u s and eu based reinsurers that meet certain qualifications in the u s once fully implemented the agreement requires u s states to lift reinsurance collateral requirements on qualifying eu based reinsurers and provide them equal treatment with u s reinsurers or be subject to
