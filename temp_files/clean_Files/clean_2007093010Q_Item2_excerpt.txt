other information about future events this quarterly report on form 10 q and other publicly available documents may include and aigs officers and representatives may from time to time make projections concerning financial information and statements concerning future economic performance and events plans and objectives relating to management operations products and services and assumptions underlying these projections and statements these projections and statements are not historical facts but instead represent only aigs belief regarding future events many of which by their nature are

results of operations and in item 1a risk factors of aigs annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2006 2006 annual report on form 10 k aig is not under any obligation and expressly disclaims any such obligations to update or alter any projection or other statement whether written or oral that may be made from time to time whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 28 american international group inc and subsidiaries in addition to reviewing aigs results for the first nine months of 2007 this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supplements and updates the information and discussion included in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aig presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful statutory loss ratios and combined ratios are presented in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities because these are standard measures of performance filed with insurance regulatory authorities and used for analysis in the insurance industry and thus allow more meaningful comparisons with aigs insurance competitors aig has also incorporated into this discussion cross references to additional information included in this quarterly report on form 10 q and in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k to assist readers seeking related information on a particular subject overview of operations and business results aig identifies its reportable segments by product or service line consistent with its management structure aigs segments are general insurance life insurance and retirement services financial services and asset management aigs operations in 2007 and 2006 were conducted by its subsidiaries through these segments through these segments aig provides insurance financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions this geographic product and service diversification is one of aigs major strengths and sets it apart from its competitors aigs other category consists of items not allocated to aigs operating segments aigs subsidiaries serve commercial institutional and individual customers through an extensive property casualty and life insurance and retirement services network in the united states aig companies are the largest underwriters of commercial and industrial insurance and are among the largest life insurance and retirement services operations as well aigs financial services businesses include commercial aircraft and equipment leasing capital markets operations and consumer finance both in the united states and abroad aig also provides asset management services to institutions and individuals as part of its spread based business activities aig issues various debt instruments in the public and private markets outlook the following paragraphs supplement and update the information and discussion included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k to reflect developments in or affecting aigs business during 2007 the commercial property and casualty insurance industry has historically experienced cycles of price erosion followed by rate strengthening as a result of catastrophes or other significant losses that affect the overall capacity of the industry to provide coverage despite industry price erosion in commercial lines aig expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new general insurance businesses as a result of aigs broad product line and extensive distribution networks in the u s and abroad in october 2007 for example aig expanded its foreign general insurance operations in germany through the acquisition of wrttembergische and badische versicherungs aktiengesellschaft workers compensation remains under considerable pricing pressure as statutory rates continue to decline rates for aviation excess casualty d and o and certain other lines of insurance also continue to decline due to competitive pressures aig also expects further price erosion for its foreign commercial lines during 2008 there can be no assurance that price erosion will not become more widespread or that aigs profitability will not deteriorate from current levels in major commercial lines however aig seeks to mitigate this risk by constantly seeking out profitable opportunities across its diverse product lines and distribution networks aig has commenced a realignment of its foreign general insurance operations many of which were historically conducted through branches of u s companies on december 1 2007 landmark insurance company limited a u k subsidiary will assume all of the insurance liabilities of the u k branch of new hampshire insurance company and will change its name to aig u k ltd in aigs foreign retirement services business the continued weak yen has resulted in higher than normal surrenders and that trend if prolonged could further accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs dac similarly in the domestic retirement services business the competitive environment and the age of the in force blocks of individual fixed annuities could result in ongoing heightened surrender activity in japan the national tax authority in cooperation with the life insurance association of japan is reviewing the tax treatment for increasing term life insurance which may affect the amount of premiums that qualify as tax deductions for business owners as a result of this review aigs life insurance companies in japan suspended the sale of increasing term life insurance from early april 2007 this action had an adverse effect on life insurance sales in the third quarter of 2007 and aig expects that trend to continue for the remainder of the year aig companies in japan have taken several measures aimed at increasing sales of other 29 american international group inc and subsidiaries products in the japanese market in particular sales of u s dollar life insurance products in japan full deregulation of banks with respect to insurance product sales will become effective in december 2007 aig expects that it will be able to leverage its existing bank relationships and innovative product expertise to expand sales of both life and accident and health products beginning in 2008 during the third quarter of 2007 the internal revenue service proposed to change the treatment of the dividends received deduction on separate account assets held in connection with variable annuity contracts this proposal was withdrawn later in the quarter for additional study should this change be adopted aig does not expect it would have a material effect on aigs consolidated financial position or results of operations for any period in march 2007 the u s treasury department published proposed new regulations that if adopted in their current form would limit the ability of u s taxpayers to claim foreign tax credits in certain circumstances under the internal revenue code should the proposed regulations be adopted in their current form they would limit aigs ability to claim foreign tax credits in connection with certain structured transactions entered into by aig financial products corp and aig trading group inc and their respective subsidiaries collectively aigfp resulting in a material adverse effect on aigfps operating results the ongoing disruption in the structured finance markets and the recent downgrades by rating agencies continue to adversely affect aigs estimates of the fair value of the super senior credit derivatives written by aigfp although it remains difficult to estimate the fair value of these derivatives due to continuing limitations on the availability of market observable data aigs best estimate of the further decline in the fair value of aigfps super senior credit derivatives since september 30 2007 is approximately 550 million as of october 31 2007 the fair value of these derivatives is expected to fluctuate perhaps materially in response to changing market conditions and aigs estimates of the value of aigfps super senior credit derivative portfolio at future dates could therefore be materially different from current estimates aig continues to believe that it is highly unlikely that aigfp will be required to make payments with respect to these derivatives the u s residential mortgage market is experiencing serious disruption due to credit quality deterioration in a significant portion of loans originated particularly to non prime and subprime borrowers evolving changes in the regulatory environment a slower residential housing market increased cost of borrowings for mortgage participants and illiquid credit markets aig participates in the u s residential mortgage market in several ways american general finance inc agf originates principally first lien mortgage loans and to a lesser extent second lien mortgage loans to buyers and owners of residential housing united guaranty corporation ugc provides first loss mortgage guaranty insurance for high loan to value first and second lien residential mortgages aig insurance and financial services subsidiaries invest in mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations cdos in which the underlying collateral is composed in whole or in part of residential mortgage loans and aigfp provides credit protection through credit default swaps on certain super senior tranches of cdos that have aaa underlying or subordinate layers the operating results of aigs consumer finance and mortgage guaranty operations in the united states have been and are likely to continue to be adversely affected by the factors referred to above the downward cycle in the u s housing market is not expected to improve until residential inventories return to a more normal level and the mortgage credit market stabilizes aig expects that this downward cycle will continue to adversely affect ugcs operating results for the foreseeable future and will result in a significant operating loss for ugc in 2008 the effect of the downward cycle in the u s housing market on aigs other operations investment portfolio and overall consolidated financial position could be material if the market disruption continues and expands beyond the u s residential mortgage markets although aig seeks to mitigate the risks to its business by disciplined underwriting and active risk management in recent quarters aigs returns from partnerships and other alternative investments were particularly strong driven by favorable equity market performance and credit conditions these returns may vary from period to period and declined significantly in the most recent quarter aig believes that the particularly strong performance in certain prior periods is not indicative of the returns to be expected from this asset class in future periods as part of an ongoing project to increase the standardization of aig actuarial systems and processes throughout the world adjustments reflecting certain changes in actuarial estimates for future policy benefits and dac have been recognized in the life insurance and retirement services segment results during 2006 and 2007 aig expects further adjustments over time as these new systems and processes are implemented aig has recorded out of period quarterly adjustments in the last two years due to the remediation of control deficiencies as aig continues its remediation activities aig expects to record additional out of period adjustments 30 american international group inc and

interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change decreased for the three month period ended september 30 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 primarily due to higher net realized capital

aigs consolidated revenues increased for the nine month period ended september 30 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 as revenues increased in each of the operating segments operating income increased in all segments with the exception of life insurance and retirement services which declined due to an increase in net realized capital losses compared to the same period in 2006 operating income for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2007 was significantly affected by the change in accounting treatment for hedging activities in the first nine months of 2007 aigfp applied hedge accounting to certain of its interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts hedging its investments and borrowings as a result aigfp recognized in earnings the change in the fair value on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks offsetting the gains and losses on the derivatives designated as hedges in 2006 aigfp did not apply hedge accounting under fas 133 to

30 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 was primarily attributable to operating losses from the mortgage guaranty business and a decline in operating income in the foreign 32 american

applying hedge accounting to most of their derivatives that hedge interest rate and foreign currency denominated borrowings prior to 2007 hedge accounting under fas 133 was not being applied to any of

reporting requirements as prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners b allocations among various lines were revised from the previous presentation aigs gross reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including provisions for losses incurred but not reported ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development estimates for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on notices of mortgage loan delinquencies and estimates of delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers based upon historical reporting trends ugc establishes reserves using a percentage of the contractual liability for each delinquent loan reported that is based upon past experience regarding certain loan factors such as age of the delinquency dollar amount of the loan and type of mortgage loan because mortgage delinquencies and claims payments are affected primarily by macroeconomic events such as changes in home price appreciation interest rates and unemployment the determination of the ultimate loss cost requires a high degree of judgment aig believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans consistent with industry practice aig does not establish a reserve for loans that are not currently delinquent but that may become delinquent in future periods at september 30 2007 general insurance net loss reserves were 66 94 billion an

management believes that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover general insurance net losses and loss expenses as of september 30 2007 while aig regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of september 30 2007 in the opinion of management such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated financial condition although it could have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the following table presents the reconciliation of net loss reserves data table removed reflects the opening balance with respect to the acquisition of the central insurance co ltd in the third quarter of 2006 the following tables summarize development favorable or unfavorable of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years other than accretion of discount data table removed represents the effect of settlements of certain asbestos liabilities data table removed in determining the quarterly loss development from prior accident years aig conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each profit center for example if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center as appropriate in the third quarter of 2007 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the third quarter of 2007 as part of its quarterly reserving process aig also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues such as those related to the u s mortgage and housing market also as part of the quarterly reserving process beginning with the second quarter of 2007 aig updated its analysis of the loss reserve discount pertaining to workers compensation reserves historically this

of the continued favorable experience for accident years 2003 through 2005 the expected loss ratios for accident year 2006 were improved for a number of casualty classes of business in the three months ended september 30 2006 for those classes of business where the expected loss ratio for accident year 2006 was adjusted in the three months ended september 30 2006 the revised loss ratio was generally applied to the cumulative 2006 net earned premium for the class the overall effect on the results for the three months ended september 30 2006 was approximately a 100 million improvement this amount represents the application of the revised expected loss ratios to the net premiums earned reported for the first six months of 2006 asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k aigs reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground up analysis in the first nine months of 2007 one large asbestos settlement as well as a reduction in estimated reinsurance recoverable resulted in a minor amount of adverse incurred loss development which was partially offset

removed a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity was as follows data table removed survival ratios asbestos and environmental the table below presents aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at september 30 2007 and 2006 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the september 30 2007 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at september 30 2006 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments in addition aigs survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by the favorable settlements described above which reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at september 30 2007 by approximately 1 4 years and 3 2 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at september 30 2007 and 2006 were as

related hedges associated with living benefit features the increases in net investment income in group retirement products and individual fixed annuities resulted from higher partnership and yield enhancement income while net investment income for individual variable annuities was lower in 2007 primarily due to policyholders election to shift from the fixed income option to the variable income option operating income for group retirement products and individual fixed annuities decreased for the nine months in 2007 driven by the lower revenues and higher expenses including higher amortization of dac for both product groups and higher sales inducement costs for individual fixed annuities dac amortization increases for group retirement products were related to the increase in surrenders and policy changes adding guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit riders to existing contracts dac amortization and sales inducement cost increases for individual fixed annuities were related to increased surrenders and an approximately 32 million adjustment reflecting certain changes in actuarial estimates from the conversion to a new dac system as well as unlocking future assumptions and experience updates individual annuities runoff operating income increased in the first nine months of 2007 over the same period of 2006 largely due to lower realized capital losses 60 american

services deposits increased for the three months ended september 30 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 group retirement deposits increased 26 percent in the three months ended september 30 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 as a result of an increase in both group annuity deposits and group mutual funds over time aig expects that group mutual fund sales will result in a gradual reduction in overall profit margins in this business due to the growth in the lower margin mutual fund products relative to the annuity products individual fixed annuity deposits decreased slightly for the three months ended september 30 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 as a result of increased competition from bank deposit products and money market funds offering competitive short term

september 30 2007 declined compared to the same period in 2006 reflecting the higher surrenders discussed above domestic retirement services deposits increased for the first nine months of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 the increase primarily reflects higher deposits from group retirement products individual fixed annuities and individual variable annuities group retirement deposits increased 10 percent in the first nine months of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 as a result of an increase in both group variable annuity and group mutual funds deposits partially offset by slightly lower deposits in group fixed annuities although individual fixed annuity sales continued to face increased competition from bank deposit products and money market funds offering very competitive short term rates in the current yield curve environment individual fixed annuity deposits increased 2 percent for the nine months ended september 30 2007 compared to the same period

securities aigfp has structured this portfolio to provide protection such that aigfp is at risk on only the super senior portion related to a diversified portfolio of credits referenced to loans or debt securities the super senior risk portion is the last tranche to suffer losses after significant subordination credit losses would have to erode all tranches junior to the super senior tranche before aigfp would have any payment obligation the subordination level required for each transaction is determined based on internal modeling and analysis of the pool of underlying credits the

risk management activities eitf 02 3 in accordance with eitf 02 3 aigfp does not recognize income in earnings at the inception of each transaction because the inputs to value these instruments are not derivable from observable market data aigfp values its super senior credit default swaps using internal methodologies that utilize available market observable information and incorporate management estimates and judgments when information is not available it also employs the binomial expansion technique bet model where appropriate to help estimate the fair value of these derivatives the bet model utilizes credit spreads for the collateral pool obtained from an independent source the model also utilizes diversity scores weighted average lives recovery rates and discount rates the bet model does not adequately quantify the benefit of certain structural mitigants such as triggers that accelerate the amortization of the more senior tranches that aigfp believes are important to the appropriate valuation of its transactions aig believes that the value of these mitigants could range from zero to 50 million but is not able to reliably estimate their value at this time therefore aigs estimate of the fair value of aigfps super senior credit default swaps as of september 30 2007 does not attribute value to these features the valuation of the super senior credit derivatives has become increasingly challenging given the limitation on the availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in the structured finance market these market conditions have increased the reliance on management estimates and judgments in arriving at an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes further disparities in the valuation methodologies employed by market participants and the varying judgments reached by such participants when assessing volatile markets has increased the likelihood that the various parties to these instruments may arrive at significantly different estimates as to their fair values as of october 31 2007 aig is aware that estimates made by certain aigfp counterparties with respect to the fair value of certain aigfp super senior credit default swaps and the collateral required in connection with such instruments differ significantly from aigfps estimates for a further description of aigfps

related to aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio principally written on multi sector cdos and an out of period charge of 51 million for a change in the projected timing of income tax cash flows from a series of lease transactions the 352 million unrealized market valuation loss represented a decline in the fair value of super senior credit derivatives for the three month period ended

or 87 percent during the three month period ended september 30 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 the decrease in revenues was primarily caused by a 72 american international group inc and subsidiaries significantly reduced origination volume and to a lesser extent tighter underwriting guidelines reduced third party margins and higher warranty reserves which cover obligations to repurchase loans sold to third party investors should there be a first payment default or breach of representations and warranties agfs interest expense increased by 9 million or 3 percent as its long

originations for real estate loans although mortgage loan originations declined in the first nine months of 2007 the softening of home price appreciation reducing the equity customers may be able to extract from their homes by refinancing contributed to an increase in non real estate loans of 12 percent at september 30 2007 compared to september 30 2006 retail sales finance receivables also

152 percent during the nine month period ended september 30 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 which also reflects charges relating to the supervisory agreement the decrease in revenues was

that while economically hedged did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 as well as other than temporary write downs on certain investments and mark to market losses on derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 these losses are partially offset by an increase in partnership income associated with the gic program and higher income from private equity partnerships partnership income is primarily 75 american international group inc and subsidiaries derived from alternative investments and is affected by performance in the equity and credit

as a result of changes in or unavailability of information or based on other circumstances ratings may also be withdrawn at aig managements request this discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of aig and its subsidiaries rating triggers have been defined by one independent rating agency to include clauses or agreements the outcome of which depends upon the level of ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies ratings triggers generally relate to events which i could result in the termination or limitation of credit availability or require accelerated repayment ii could result in the termination of business contracts or iii could require a company to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties aig believes that any of its own or its subsidiaries contractual obligations that are subject to ratings triggers or financial covenants relating to ratings triggers would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or liquidity ratings downgrades could also trigger the application of termination provisions in certain of aigs contracts principally agreements entered into by aigfp and assumed reinsurance contracts entered into by transatlantic it is estimated that as of the close of business on october 31 2007 based on aigfps outstanding municipal gias and financial derivatives transactions as of such date a downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings to aa3 by moodys or aa by s and p would permit counterparties to call for approximately 830 million of collateral further additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral which could have a material effect on how aigfp manages its liquidity the actual amount of additional collateral that aigfp would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions the fair value of the outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade additional obligations to post collateral would increase the demand on aigfps liquidity 82 american international group inc and subsidiaries contractual obligations and other commercial commitments

third quarter and approximately 819 million was on watch for downgrade and approximately 30 million on watch for upgrade aig currently intends to hold these securities to full recovery and or full payment of principal and interest and therefore expects that any mark to market effect will result in only a temporary adjustment to shareholders equity 86 american international group inc and subsidiaries aigs underwriting practices for investing in rmbs other asset backed securities and cdos takes into consideration the quality of the originator the manager the servicer security credit ratings underlying characteristics of the mortgages borrower characteristics and the level of credit enhancement in the transaction aigs strategy is typically to invest in securities rated aa or

the following table presents the period end average high and low vars based on daily observations on a diversified basis and of each component of market risk for aigs capital markets operations the diversified var is usually smaller than the sum of its components due to correlation effects data table removed catastrophe exposures the nature of aigs business exposes it to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year in order to control this exposure aig uses a combination of techniques including setting aggregate limits in key business units monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect aigs operating results other risks such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease such as the avian influenza a virus h5n1 could adversely affect aigs business and operating results to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance programs aig evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of industry recognized models among other techniques aig supplements these models by periodically monitoring the exposure risks of aigs worldwide general insurance operations and adjusting such models accordingly following is an overview of modeled losses associated with the more significant natural perils which includes exposures for dbg personal lines foreign general other than ascot the hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company and 21st century transatlantic and ascot utilize a different model and their combined results are presented separately below significant life and a and h exposures have been added to these results as well the modeled results assume that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to aig in accordance with their terms it is important to recognize that there is no standard methodology to project the possible losses from total property and workers compensation exposures further there are no industry standard assumptions to be utilized in projecting these losses the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses therefore these modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not reflect aigs maximum exposures to these events it is highly likely that aigs losses will vary perhaps significantly from these estimates aig has revised the catastrophe exposure disclosures presented below from that presented in the 2006 annual report on form 10 k to include significant life and a and h exposures to natural perils as well as to update the domestic property exposures to reflect more recent data the modeled results provided in the table below were based on the aggregate exceedence probability aep losses which represent total property workers compensation life and accident and health losses that may occur in any single year from one or more natural events the life and a and h data include exposures for united states japan and taiwan earthquakes these represent the largest share of life and a and h exposures to earthquake a and h losses were modeled using december 2006 data and life losses were modeled using march 2006 data the updated property exposures were generally modeled with exposure data as of year end 2006 lexington commercial lines exposure which represents the largest share of the modeled losses was based on data as of april 2007 all reinsurance program structures including both domestic and international structures have also been updated the values provided were based on 100 year return period losses which have a one percent likelihood of being exceeded in any single year thus the model projects that there is a one percent probability that aig could incur in any year losses in excess of the modeled amounts for these perils 90 american international group inc and subsidiaries data table removed includes hurricanes typhoons and other wind related events the combined earthquake and tropical cyclone 100 year return period modeled losses for ascot and transatlantic together are estimated to be 1 1 billion on a gross basis 761 million net of reinsurance and 494 million net after income taxes or 0 5 percent of total shareholders equity at september 30 2007 in addition aig evaluates potential single event earthquake and hurricane losses that may be incurred the single events utilized are a subset of potential events identified and utilized by lloyds 1 and referred to as realistic disaster scenarios rdss the purpose of this analysis is to utilize these rdss to provide a reference frame and place into context the model results however it is important to note that the specific events used for this analysis do not necessarily represent the worst case loss that aig could incur from this type of an event in these regions the losses associated with the rdss are included in the table below single event modeled property and workers compensation losses to aigs worldwide portfolio of risk for key geographic areas are set forth below gross values represent aigs liability after the application of policy limits and deductibles and net values represent losses after reinsurance is applied data table removed 1 lloyds realistic disaster scenarios scenario specifications april 2006 the specific international rds events do not necessarily correspond to aigs international property exposures as a result aig runs its own simulations where property statistical return period losses associated with the written exposure specific to aig provide the basis for monitoring risk based on these simulations the 100 year return period loss for japanese earthquake is 296 million gross and 120 million net the 100 year return period loss for european windstorm is 269 million gross and 80 million net and the 100 year return period loss for japanese typhoon is 306 million gross and 252 million net recent market conditions in the u s property business have supported growth in this line of business consequently gross modeled catastrophe losses have increased associated net exposure has been carefully monitored and controlled through the strategic placement of reinsurance actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and the occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated financial condition results of operations and liquidity 91 american international group inc and
