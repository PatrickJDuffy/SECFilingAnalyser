addition aig also expects to 92 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries collect dividends distributions and other payments from certain subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations additional liquidity is also available under the department of treasury commitment in the first nine months of 2009 aig made capital contributions of 2 4 billion to certain of its domestic life insurance and retirement services companies approximately 1 2 billion of this amount was funded through drawdowns under the department of the treasury commitment if a substantial portion of the

regulatory approval proceeds from these dispositions to the extent they do not represent capital of aig insurance subsidiaries required for regulatory or ratings purposes are contractually required to be applied toward the repayment of the frbny facility as mandatory prepayments during the first nine months of 2009 and through october 30 2009 aig entered into agreements to sell or completed the sale of operations and assets excluding aigfp assets that had aggregate assets and liabilities with carrying values of 86 3 billion and 69 2 billion respectively at september 30 2009 or the date of sale or in the case of transatlantic deconsolidation these transactions are expected to generate approximately 5 6 billion of aggregate net cash proceeds that will be available to repay outstanding borrowings and reduce the amount of the frbny facility after taking into account taxes transaction expenses settlement of intercompany loan facilities and capital required to be retained for regulatory or ratings purposes gains and losses recorded in connection with the dispositions of businesses include estimates that are subject to subsequent adjustment based on the transactions thus

headquarters building in tokyo for approximately 1 2 billion in cash due to aig continued involvement as a lessee primarily in the form of a lease deposit through 2011 the sale is accounted for as a

nan shan and recognize a loss presently estimated to be 1 4 billion net of taxes in that quarter aig analyzed its assets and liabilities including its deferred acquisition costs and the adequacy of its insurance liabilities as of september 30 2009 before nan shan met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and concluded that no impairment of assets or recognition of additional liabilities was necessary agf portfolio sales and securitization transaction during the first nine months of 2009 agf received proceeds of 1 7 billion from real estate loan portfolio sales in addition on july 30 2009 agf issued mortgage backed certificates in a private securitization transaction of certain agf real estate loans and received initial cash proceeds of 967 million aigfp wind down aigfp is engaged in a multi step process of unwinding its businesses and portfolios in connection with that process certain assets have been sold or are under contract to be sold the proceeds from these sales will be used to fund aigfp wind down and are not included in the amounts described above under sales of businesses the frbny has waived the requirement under the frbny credit agreement that the proceeds of these specific pending sales be applied as a mandatory prepayment under the frbny facility which would result in a permanent reduction of the frbny commitment to lend to aig instead the frbny has given aigfp permission to retain the proceeds of these completed sales and has required that such proceeds received from certain future sales be used to voluntarily prepay the frbny facility with the amounts prepaid available for future reborrowing subject to the terms of the frbny facility aigfp is also opportunistically terminating contracts aigfp is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio reduce risk and hedge the currency interest rate and other market risks associated with aig affiliated businesses due to the long term duration of aigfp derivative contracts and the complexity of aigfp portfolio aig expects that an orderly wind down of aigfp will take a substantial period of time the cost of executing the wind down will depend on many factors many of which are not within aig control including market conditions aigfp access to markets via market counterparties the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades on august 11 2009 aigfp completed the sale of its energy and infrastructure investment assets realizing aggregate net proceeds of 619 million for the nine month period ended september 30 2009 aig continually evaluates overall market conditions performance of businesses that are for sale and market and business performance of competitors and likely bidders for these assets this evaluation informs decision making about the timing and process of putting businesses up for sale depending on market and business conditions as 94 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries noted above aig can modify its sales approach to maximize value for aig and the u s taxpayers in the disposition process such a modification could result in the sale of additional or other assets liquidity of parent and subsidiaries since august 2009 aig liquidity position has remained relatively stable see item 1a risk factors in the 2008 form 10 k for a discussion of risks related to liquidity aig parent aig parent had the following sources of liquidity data table removed aig believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the parent level to meet its obligations through at least the next twelve months however no assurance can be given that aig cash needs will not exceed projected amounts additional collateral calls at aigfp a further downgrade of aig credit ratings or unexpected capital or liquidity needs of aig subsidiaries may result in significant additional cash needs or loss of some sources of liquidity or both since the fourth quarter of 2008 aig has not had access to its traditional sources of long term or short term financing through the public debt markets while no assurance can be given that aig will be able to access these markets again aig continually evaluates its ability to access the capital markets historically aig depended on dividends distributions and other payments from subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations in light of aig current financial situation certain of its regulated subsidiaries are restricted from making dividend payments or advancing funds to aig as a result aig has been dependent on the frbny facility the cpff and other transactions with the frbny and the department of the treasury as its primary sources of liquidity primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and subsidiary funding in the nine month period ended september 30 2009 aig parent collected 1 2 billion in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries primarily from insurance company subsidiaries and retired 381 million of debt excluding mip and series aigfp debt excluding mip and series aigfp debt aig parent made interest payments totaling 1 4 billion and made 2 6 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries in the nine months ended september 30 2009 in addition during the nine months ended september 30 2009 aig parent made loans totaling 1 2 billion to wholly owned subsidiaries which in turn principally were used to make capital contributions to insurance companies aig parent traditionally funded a portion of its short term working capital needs through commercial paper issued by aig funding since october 2008 all commercial paper issuance for aig funding has been through the cpff program aig funding was accepted into the cpff with a total borrowing limit of 6 9 billion and had approximately 3 4 billion and 2 0 billion outstanding at september 30 2009 and october 28 2009 respectively all commercial paper outstanding for aig funding as of these dates was issued under the cpff as of september 30 2009 and october 28 2009 aig funding commercial paper program had average maturities of 23 days and 86 days respectively the board of governors of the federal reserve system has extended the cpff program until february 1 2010 with the maximum final maturity of 90 days from that date if aig short term ratings are downgraded aig may lose access to the cpff before the final maturity if aig loses access to the cpff it would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper aig expects to use proceeds from the repayment of intercompany debt received in connection with the sales of assets to fund maturing commercial paper 95 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries the consolidated u s members deferred tax asset for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and valuation allowance are maintained at aig parent and are not allocated to its subsidiaries as the consolidated net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards are utilized the intercompany tax balance will be settled with the subsidiaries aig liquidity could also be further impaired by unforeseen significant outflows of cash this situation may arise due to circumstances that aig may be unable to control such as a further reduction in asset values a ratings downgrade a worsening of the current economic downturn or the requirements of subsidiaries to replace capital as a consequence of catastrophe claims regulatory and other legal restrictions would likely limit aig ability to transfer funds freely either to or from its subsidiaries general insurance aig currently expects that its general insurance subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due through cash from operations and to the extent necessary asset dispositions one or more large catastrophes however may require aig to provide additional support to the affected general insurance operations in addition further downgrades in aig credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of these subsidiaries a downgrade in the insurer financial strength ratings of an insurance company subsidiary could result in non renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect these companies ability to meet their own obligations and require that aig provide capital or liquidity support to them at september 30 2009 general insurance had liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments of 10 5 billion these are consolidated cash and short term investments for a number of legal entities within general insurance generally these assets are not transferable across various legal entities however there are generally sufficient cash and short term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs in the event additional liquidity is required management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities government and corporate bonds represented 95 3 percent of general insurance total fixed income investments at september 30 2009 given the size and liquidity profile of aig general insurance investment portfolios aig believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk aig asset liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and the specific nature and risk profile of liabilities historically there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of aig general insurance investments and the payment of claims life insurance and retirement services at september 30 2009 life insurance and retirement services had liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments of 35 4 billion which management considers more than adequate to meet foreseeable liquidity needs this unusually high level of liquidity although considered by management to be prudent given recent market disruptions and aig specific issues has resulted in reduced investment income in 2009 these are consolidated cash and short term investments for a number of legal entities within life insurance and retirement services generally these assets are not transferable across various legal entities however there are generally sufficient cash and short term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs in the event additional liquidity is required management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities government and corporate bonds represented 86 7 percent of life insurance and retirement services total fixed income investments at september 30 2009 given the size and liquidity profile of aig life insurance and retirement services investment portfolios aig believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk the life insurance and retirement services subsidiaries have been able to meet liquidity needs even during the period of higher surrenders which was experienced from mid september 2008 through the first quarter of 2009 and expect to be able to do so in the foreseeable future a significant increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals which could be triggered by a variety of factors including aig specific concerns could result in a substantial liquidity strain other potential events causing a liquidity strain could include economic collapse of a nation or region significant to life insurance and retirement services operations nationalization catastrophic terrorist acts pandemics or other economic or political upheaval 96 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries foreign life insurance companies aig foreign life insurance companies including alico had significant capital needs following publicity of aig parent liquidity issues related credit ratings downgrades and the decline in the equity markets in 2008 during the nine months ended september 30 2009 aig provided funding of 300 million to a subsidiary within the foreign life insurance companies aig believes that its foreign life insurance subsidiaries currently have adequate capital to support their business plans however to the extent there are future declines in the investment portfolios of the foreign life insurance companies aig may need to lend or contribute additional capital to these companies domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies during the nine months ended september 30 2009 aig contributed capital totaling 2 4 billion to certain of its domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services subsidiaries of which 165 million was retained in the domestic life insurance holding company and not contributed to the operating companies to replace a portion of the capital lost as a result of net realized capital losses primarily resulting from other than temporary impairment charges and other investment related items of this amount 1 2 billion was funded by drawdowns under the department of the treasury commitment in may 2009 further capital contributions may be required to maintain desired levels of capital to the extent there are future declines in the investment portfolios of the domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies the most significant potential liquidity needs of aig domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies are the funding of surrenders and withdrawals a substantial increase in these needs could place stress on the liquidity of these companies however management believes that these companies have sufficient short term liquidity to meet such demands financial services aig major financial services operating subsidiaries consist of ilfc aigfp agf and aig consumer finance group inc aigcfg traditional sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of these operations are generally no longer available these sources included issuances of guaranteed investment agreements gias issuance of long and short term debt issuance of commercial paper bank loans and bank credit facilities however ilfc has been able to finance airbus aircraft purchases under its 2004 export credit agency eca facility as further described below and aigcfg has been able to retain a significant portion of customer deposits providing a measure of liquidity ilfc prior to september 2008 ilfc traditional sources of liquidity had been collections of aircraft lease payments borrowings in the public debt markets borrowings under its 1999 and 2004 eca facilities to fund aircraft purchases proceeds of aircraft sales and income from third parties for fleet management services during the first nine months of 2009 ilfc was unable to borrow in the public debt markets and due to downgrades in its short term credit rating lost access to the cpff and therefore borrowed 1 7 billion from aig funding to repay its maturing debt and other contractual obligations in addition ilfc borrowed approximately 161 million through secured financing arrangements ilfc is currently pursuing additional secured financings from banks ilfc had the capacity under its present facilities and indentures to enter into secured financing of approximately 5 0 billion or more through subsidiaries that qualify as non restricted subsidiaries under ilfc indentures subject to the receipt of any required consents under the frbny facility and under its bank facilities and terms loans if ilfc does not receive sufficient secured financing aig expects that ilfc current borrowings and future cash flows from operations which may include aircraft sales may be inadequate to permit ilfc to meet its existing obligations should sales of aircraft be required ilfc could incur losses on those sales and may incur impairment charges on its aircraft depending on among other things the specific aircraft sold and market conditions at the time of sale aig intends to provide support to ilfc through november 15 2010 to the extent that secured financing aircraft sales and other sources of funds are not sufficient 97 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries under its current long term debt ratings ilfc needs written consent from the security trustee of its 2004 eca facility before it can fund airbus aircraft deliveries under the facility as of october 30 2009 ilfc had approximately 600 million available under the 2004 eca facility to finance its airbus aircraft purchases through june 2010 ilfc financed 25 aircraft under the 2004 eca facility during the first nine months of 2009 19 of which required written consent which was obtained ilfc current credit ratings also require segregation of security deposits and maintenance reserves for aircraft funded under both its 1999 and 2004 eca facilities into separate accounts as a result of moody downgrade of ilfc long term debt ratings to baa3 on july 31 2009 in addition to segregation of security deposits and maintenance reserves under the 2004 eca facility ilfc is required to i segregate subsequent rental payments received into the separate accounts ii cede control of the segregated accounts to the security trustee of the 2004 eca facility and iii file individual mortgages on the aircraft funded under the facility in the respective local jurisdictions in which its

chartis international and private client group part of chartis u s aig commercial insurance operations have been generally successful in retaining clients however some clients reduced the number of lines or limits of coverage due in part to the overall state of the economy as well as concerns over aig financial strength this trend of de risking is expected to slow for the remainder of 2009 as

insurance showed increases in submission counts and 1 1 billion in new business written for the second consecutive quarter net premiums written have been affected by the strategic decision to remain price disciplined particularly in the workers compensation line of business and the overall effect of the weakened state of the economy rates in the third quarter of 2009 remained stable reflecting the upward pressure on premiums from the combination of investment and underwriting losses suffered by the commercial insurance industry partially offset by the effects of the current recessionary environment such as employment levels for workers compensation coverages and shipments of goods for commercial automobile coverages as well as aggressive pricing including from new competitors in the marketplace foreign general insurance maintained solid client retention rates in the third quarter of 2009 in key regions the trend of de risking by some customers and the effect of the economic conditions is expected to slow and therefore foreign general net premiums written are anticipated to stabilize although foreign general faces challenges in commercial lines particularly in the u k and

foreign investment oriented and retirement products surrender levels have declined from their peaks in mid september of 2008 and have begun to stabilize and return to pre september 2008 levels for most products and countries these uncertainties together with rating agency downgrades have resulted in significantly reduced levels of new sales activity particularly among products and markets where ratings are critical sales of investment oriented and retirement services products have also declined due to the lingering effect of negative aig events earlier in the year and the overall decline in industry sales of investment oriented life and retirement services products new sales activity is expected to remain at lower levels for certain markets until the uncertainties relating to aig are

purchase agreement and the alico purchase agreement are conditioned on one another and subject to certain other conditions including regulatory approvals it is expected that the transactions will result in a reduction in the outstanding balance of the frbny facility and the maximum amount available to be borrowed thereunder equal to the liquidation preference of the preferred equity which will be 25 billion provided the maximum amount available under the frbny facility will not be less than 25 billion as a result of such reduction with the adoption of the new other than temporary impairments accounting standard in the second quarter of 2009 aig expects future investment yields to decline compared to the same periods in 2008 due to lower accretion in prior periods aig accreted into earnings over the expected period to recovery the discount or reduced premium resulting from the reduction in the cost basis of other than temporarily impaired securities which consisted primarily of securities impaired for severity reasons upon the adoption of the new other than temporary impairments accounting standard approximately 1 8 billion of previously recognized other than temporarily impaired charges primarily severity related were reclassified from accumulated deficit to accumulated other comprehensive income as a consequence commencing in the second quarter of 2009 there will be no accretion attributable to the amounts reclassified into accumulated other comprehensive income this will be partially offset by lower deferred policy acquisition costs dac and sales

question alternative strategies including sales assignments or other transfers of positions terminations of positions and or run offs of positions in accordance with existing terms execution of these plans is overseen by a transaction approval process involving increasingly senior members of aigfp and aig respective management groups as specific actions entail greater liquidity and financial

environmental the following table presents aig survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at september 30 2009 and 2008 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the september 30 2009 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at september 30 2008 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments in addition aig survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007 these settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at september 30 2009 by approximately 0 8 years and 1 9 years respectively and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at september 30 2008 by approximately 1 2 years and 2 7 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aig determination of its reserves is not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aig

connection with aig adoption of the new other than temporary impairments accounting standard on april 1 2009 aig changed its process for determining other than temporary impairments with respect to available for sale fixed maturity securities if aig intends to sell a fixed maturity security or it is more likely than not that aig will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security is below amortized cost an other than temporary impairment has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to current fair value with

table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries aig continues to evaluate its available for sale equity securities equity method and cost method investments for impairment such that a security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant 25 percent or more discount to cost for an extended period of time nine consecutive months or longer the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or aig may not realize a full recovery on its investment regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events the determination that an equity security is other than temporarily impaired requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer its near term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances the above criteria also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe

impairment goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred aig performed goodwill impairment testing at september 30 2009 the impairment assessment involves a two step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and if potential impairment is present the amount of impairment is measured if any and recorded impairment is tested at the reporting unit level management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of aig reporting units and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units including allocated goodwill the estimate of a reporting unit fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market based earning multiples of the unit peer companies discounted expected future cash flows external appraisals or in the case of reporting units being considered for sale third party indications of fair value if available management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test as part of the impairment test management compares the sum of the estimated fair values of all aig reporting units with aig fully diluted common stock market capitalization as a basis for concluding on the reasonableness of the estimated reporting unit fair values if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired the amount of impairment if any is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill the estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting unit assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination

regulatory proceedings related to aig activities as a global diversified financial services institution to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment in many such proceedings it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum

asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized realization of aig net deferred tax asset depends on aig ability to consummate the proposed aia and alico transactions and to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character within carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating and capital losses tax credits and deductible temporary differences were incurred estimates of future taxable income could change in the near term perhaps materially which may require aig to adjust its valuation allowance such adjustment either positive or negative could be material to aig consolidated financial condition or its results of operations because the realization of the deferred tax asset relies on the completion of the proposed transactions and a projection of future taxable income aig views this as a critical accounting estimate aig is also relying to a lesser extent upon producing taxable operating profits from the businesses to be retained principally commercial insurance and foreign general insurance aig has evaluated its forecasts of future operating income and determined that there will be sufficient operating income

received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing able and knowledgeable market participants at the measurement date the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value conversely financial instruments traded in other than active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment an active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis an other than active market is one in which there are few transactions the prices are not current price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers or in which little information is released publicly for the asset or liability being valued pricing observability is affected by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions aig management is responsible for the determination of the value of the financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions with respect to securities aig employs independent third party valuation service providers to gather analyze and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments when aig valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote which is generally non binding or by employing widely accepted internal valuation models valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and through the use of widely accepted internal valuation models provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of service agreements the inputs used by the valuation service providers include but are not limited to market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities interest rate yield curves credit spreads 164 table of

next six months during the transition period of the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards issued by the basel committee on banking supervision basel ii aigfp has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties the regulatory benefit of these transactions for aigfp financial institution counterparties is generally derived from the terms of the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision basel i that existed through the end of 2007 and which is in the process of being replaced by basel ii it is expected that financial institution counterparties will have transitioned from basel i to basel ii by the end of the two year adoption period on december 31 2009 after which they will receive little or no additional regulatory benefit from these cds transactions except in a small number of specific instances however the basel committee recently announced that it has agreed to keep in place the basel i capital floors beyond the end of 2009 although it remains to be seen how this extension will be implemented by the various european central banking districts should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the

billion in net notional amount that was reported as part of regulatory capital other at march 31 2009 at a level approximating its fair value at that time given its unique structure and concentrated exposure to high loan to value spanish residential mortgages this transaction had exposed aigfp to a relatively higher level of liquidity and credit risk than any other regulatory capital cds exposure and aig felt it prudent to terminate the transaction to avoid further deterioration in light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data to the extent deemed relevant and available aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the nine months ended september 30 2009 other than for transactions where aigfp believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above although aigfp believes the value of contractual fees receivable on these transactions through maturity exceeds the economic benefits of any potential payments to the counterparties the counterparties early termination

institution or its affiliates receiving the credit protection rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties in the vast majority of transactions the loans are

transaction is not consistent across all transactions furthermore in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions the pools are blind meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to aigfp in addition although aigfp receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools virtually all of the regulatory capital cds transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude aigfp public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets the originating financial institutions calculation agents or trustees each a report 171 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries provider provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below including for those within the blind pools while much of this information received by aigfp cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the

underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available but aigfp estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the report providers to rating agency criteria the percent non investment grade information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the cds transactions which is determined by the individual transaction structures for example small and medium enterprise sme loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large well established enterprises however the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the sme loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools in addition the transaction structures reflect aigfp assessment of the loan collateral arrangements expected recovery values and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss the percentage of non investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably the four pools containing the highest percentages of non investment grade obligations which include all transactions with pools having non investment grade percentages greater than 35 00 percent are all granular sme loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions the average number of loans in each pool is over 5 000 this large number of sme loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool three of the four transactions benefit from a tranche junior to it which was still rated aaa by at least two rating agencies at september 30 2009 and the fourth was rated a three other pools with a total net notional amount of 3 6

of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries collateral most of aigfp credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes although aigfp has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi sector cdos regulatory capital relief transactions as of september 30 2009 73 2 percent of aigfp regulatory capital relief transactions measured by net notional amount were subject to a credit support annex csa and 26 8 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions in general each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand alone master agreement or similar agreement under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction the underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty and there is no standard formula the varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties the following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio reference to market indicesunder this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index such as either itraxx or cdx this mechanism is used for cds transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages while the market index is not a direct proxy it has the advantage of being readily obtainable market value of reference obligationunder this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the difference between the net notional amount of a referenced rmbs security and the security market value expected loss modelsunder this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses generally determined using a rating agency model negotiated amountunder this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between aigfp and the counterparty which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by aigfp the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio prior to consideration of transactions other than aigfp super senior credit default swaps subject to the same master agreements as of the periods ended were as

group inc and subsidiaries respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage the amount of collateral postings with respect to aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions as of the periods ended were as follows data table removed the amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of aig credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor while a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined given the severe market disruption lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption aigfp is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future valuation sensitivity arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aig calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average prices for cdos declined 9 96 percent and 5 57 percent of the notional amount outstanding for the first and second quarters of 2009 respectively however for the three month period ended september 30 2009 prices for cdos increased by an average of 5 13 percent of the notional amount outstanding further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current dislocated market conditions for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the total 8 2 billion net notional amount of cds written on multi sector cdos outstanding at september 30 2009 a bet value is available for 5 0 billion net notional amount no bet value is determined for 3 2 billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 5 0 billion as mentioned above the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities given their significantly depressed valuations 179 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries given the current difficult market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo at this time the following table presents key inputs used in the bet model and the potential increase decrease to the fair value of the derivative liability by abs category at september 30 2009 corresponding to changes in these key inputs data table removed a the

these results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption no assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed

inputs data table removed during the third quarter of 2009 aigfp enhanced its valuation methodology for credit default swaps written on portfolios of investment grade corporate debt this new methodology uses a mathematical model that produces results that are more closely aligned with prices received from third parties this methodology is widely used by other market participants and uses

difficult market conditions in recent quarters have significantly hindered aig ability to achieve these objectives and these challenges are expected to persist for the foreseeable future at the local operating unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at aig consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities in the case of life insurance and retirement services companies as well as in the gic and mip portfolios of the asset management segment the fundamental investment strategy is to match as nearly as is practicable the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in commercial insurance historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in light of aig net operating losses in the third quarter of 2008 aig changed its intent to hold to maturity certain tax exempt municipal securities held by its insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities held by foreign general insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities the market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components including interest rate environment credit spread embedded optionality such as call features liquidity structural complexity foreign exchange risk and other credit and non credit factors however in most circumstances pricing is most sensitive to interest rates such that the market price declines as interest rates rise and increases as interest rates fall this effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities aig records at fair value the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies however with limited exceptions primarily with respect to separate account products consolidated on aig balance sheet aig does not adjust the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities and falling interest rates have the opposite effect this results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains losses on securities in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative inverse changes in gains losses on aig liabilities because aig asset duration in certain low yield currencies particularly japan and taiwan is shorter than its liability
