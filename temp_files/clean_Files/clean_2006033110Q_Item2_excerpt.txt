finance both in the united states and abroad aig also provides asset management services and offers guaranteed investment contracts gics to institutions and individuals aigs operating performance reflects implementation of various long term strategies and defined goals in its various operating segments a primary goal of aig in managing its general insurance operations is to achieve an underwriting profit to achieve this goal aig must be disciplined in its risk selection and premiums must be adequate and terms and conditions appropriate to cover the risk accepted aig also believes in strict control of expenses a central focus of aig operations in recent years is the development and expansion of new distribution channels in 2005 and the first three months of 2006 aig expanded its distribution channels which now include banks credit card companies and television media home shopping in many asian countries examples of new distribution channels used both domestically and overseas include banks affinity groups direct response and e commerce aig patiently builds relationships in markets around the world where it sees long term growth opportunities for example the fact that aig has the only wholly owned foreign life insurance operations in eight cities in china is the result of relationships developed over nearly 30 years aigs more recent extensions of operations into india vietnam russia and other emerging markets reflect the same growth strategy moreover aig believes in investing in the economies and infrastructures of these countries and growing with them when aig companies enter a new jurisdiction they typically offer both basic protection and savings products as the economies evolve aigs products evolve with them to more sophisticated and investment oriented models growth for aig may be generated both internally and through acquisitions which both fulfill strategic goals and offer adequate return on capital recently aig announced its acquisition

ended march 31 2006 and 2005 data table removed consolidated results the small increase in revenues in the first three months of 2006 was primarily attributable to the growth in net premiums earned from global general insurance operations as well as growth in both general insurance and life insurance and retirement services net investment income and life insurance and retirement services gaap premiums offset in part by decreases in revenue in the financial services and asset management segments aigs income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change decreased 15 percent in the first three months of 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005 increases in general insurance and life insurance and retirement services operating income were offset by an operating loss in financial services driven by the effects of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 and a decrease in asset 30 american international group inc and subsidiaries management operating income results for the first three months of 2006 were negatively affected by the compensation expense relating to the starr tender offer 54 million before tax and after tax and an additional allowance for losses in aig credit card company taiwan 88 million before tax and 57 million after tax results were also negatively affected by

2006 and 2005 respectively general insurance aigs general insurance operations provide property and casualty products and services throughout the world the increase in general insurance operating income in the first three months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 was primarily attributable to improvement in underwriting results with respect to the domestic brokerage group dbg general insurance operating income included adverse development in the first three months of 2006 and 2005 from catastrophes in prior years life insurance and retirement services aigs life insurance and retirement services operations provide insurance financial and investment products throughout the world foreign operations provided approximately 65 percent and 55 percent of aigs life insurance and retirement services operating income for the first three months of 2006 and 2005 respectively life insurance and retirement services operating income increased by 17 percent in the first three months of 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005 driven by a 39 percent increase in foreign life insurance and retirement services operating income offset in part by an approximately 10 percent decrease in the domestic life insurance and retirement services operating income primarily due to lower partnership income realized capital gains included in revenues and operating income were 158 million in the first three months of 2006 compared to realized capital losses of 82 million in the same period of 2005 the increase in realized capital gains in the first three months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 was due to the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting under fas 133 and the foreign exchange gains and losses related to the application of fas 52 offset by other than temporary declines in the value of investments financial services aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing capital market transactions consumer finance and insurance premium financing financial services operating income decreased in the first three months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 primarily due to the fluctuation in earnings resulting from the accounting effect of fas 133 fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of capital markets operations and the effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 for hedges on securities available for sale and borrowings consumer finance revenues increased but operating income decreased primarily as a result of increasing the allowance for losses in connection with the industry wide credit deterioration in the taiwan credit card market 31 american international group inc and subsidiaries asset management aigs asset management operations include institutional and retail asset management and broker dealer services and spread based investment business from the sale of gics these products and services are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas asset management operating income decreased 22 percent in the first three months of 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005 as a result of continued run off in aigs gic portfolio combined with spread compression in addition there was a decline in realized gains on sales of real estate investments and performance fees earned on various private equity investments capital resources at march 31 2006 aig had total consolidated shareholders equity of 88 39 billion and total consolidated borrowings of 118 8 billion at that date 104 1 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by aig or were aigfps

18 59 billion in cash and short term investments consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in the first three months of 2006 amounted to 3 07 billion aig believes that its liquid assets cash provided by operations and access to short term funding through commercial paper and bank credit facilities will enable it to meet any anticipated cash requirements outlook despite industry price erosion in some classes of general insurance aig expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new general insurance businesses as a result of aigs broad product line and extensive distribution networks in december 2005 american international underwriters overseas ltd aiuo received a license from the government of vietnam to operate a wholly owned general insurance company in vietnam this license the first general insurance license granted by vietnam to a u s based insurance organization permits aig to operate a general insurance company throughout vietnam in china aig has wholly owned life insurance operations in eight cities these operations should benefit from chinas rapid rate of economic growth and growing middle class a segment that is a prime market for life insurance chinese insurance regulators have indicated satisfaction with the implementation of corrective measures to stop aigs hong kong based agents from selling life insurance to mainland chinese in april 2006 applications for provincial expansion of aigs life insurance operations in guangdong and jiangsu and of general insurance operations in guangdong were approved and aig

insurance and retirement services businesses to continue growing in 2006 through distribution channel expansion and new and enhanced products the home service operation which is expected to be a slow growth business has not met business objectives although its cash flow has been strong domestic group life health results continue to be weak reflecting the ongoing restructuring activities including the consideration of exiting certain product lines aig retirement services individual fixed annuities business will continue to be challenged due to the interest rate environment and increased competition from bank products in the airline industry changes in market conditions are not immediately apparent in operating results lease rates have firmed as a result of strong demand spurred by the recovering global commercial aviation market especially in asia sales have begun to increase and aig expects an increasing level of interest from a variety of purchasers however higher interest rates are expected to continue to compress lease margins aigs consumer finance operations overseas have been negatively affected in 2006 by industry wide credit deterioration in the taiwan credit card market gics which are sold domestically and abroad to both institutions and individuals are written on an opportunistic basis when market conditions are favorable in september 2005 aig launched a 10 billion medium term note program in the euromarkets under which aig debt securities are issued primarily for a matched investment program in april 2006 aig issued its first debt securities under the matched investment program selling euro 500 million principal amount of notes aig also expects to launch a matched investment program in the domestic market which along with 32 american international group inc and subsidiaries the euro program will become aigs principal spread based investment activity however the timing of the launch of the domestic program remains uncertain because aigs credit spreads in the capital markets have widened following the ratings declines described in item 1a risk factors there may be a reduction in the earnings on new business in aigs spread based funding businesses aig has many promising growth initiatives underway around the world cooperative agreements such as those with picc property and casualty company limited and various banks in the u s japan and korea are expected to expand distribution networks for aigs products and provide models for future growth critical accounting estimates aig considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts deferred policy acquisition costs estimated gross profits for investment oriented products fair value determinations for certain capital markets assets and liabilities other than temporary declines in the value of investments and flight equipment recoverability these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used aigs results of operations would be directly affected throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aigs critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail the major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below reserves for losses and loss expenses general insurance

rates aig attempts to secure reliable and independent current market price data such as published exchange rates from external subscription services such as bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in its model when such prices are not available aig uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation and extrapolation from verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the transactions other than temporary declines in the value of investments a security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment based upon the following criteria trading at a significant 25 percent or more discount to par or amortized cost if lower for an extended period of time nine months or longer the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the debtor defaulting or seeking bankruptcy or insolvency protection or voluntary reorganization the probability of non realization of a full recovery on its investment irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events at each balance sheet date aig evaluates its securities holdings in an unrealized loss position where aig does not intend to hold such securities until they have fully recovered their carrying value based on the circumstances present at the date of evaluation aig records the unrealized loss in income if events or circumstances change such as unexpected changes in creditworthiness of the obligor general interest rate environment tax circumstances liquidity events 33 american international group inc and subsidiaries and statutory capital management considerations among others aig revisits its intent to determine if a loss should be recorded in income further if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date pursuant to these changes in circumstances the loss is recognized in the period in which the intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer exists flight equipment recoverability financial services expected

certain other general insurance company subsidiaries of aig dbg writes substantially all classes of business insurance accepting such business mainly from insurance brokers this provides dbg the opportunity to select specialized markets and retain underwriting control any licensed broker is able to submit business to dbg without the traditional agent company contractual relationship but such

included in dbg are the operations of aig environmental which focuses specifically on providing specialty products to clients with environmental exposures lexington writes surplus lines those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts certain of the products of the dbg companies include funding components or have been structured in a manner such that little or no insurance risk is actually transferred funds received in connection with these

group uses various marketing methods and multiple distribution channels to write both commercial and consumer lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws customs and needs aiu operates in asia the pacific rim the united kingdom europe africa the middle east and latin america as previously noted aig believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its investors accordingly in its general insurance business aig uses certain regulatory measures where aig has determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful a critical discipline of a successful general insurance business is the objective to produce profit from underwriting activities exclusive of investment related income when underwriting is not profitable premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses and underwriting related expenses in these situations the addition of general insurance related investment income and realized capital gains may however enable a general insurance business to produce operating income for these reasons aig views underwriting results to be criti 34 american international group inc and subsidiaries cal in the overall evaluation of performance see also the discussion under liquidity herein statutory underwriting profit is derived by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting generally requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes expenses are recognized immediately not over the same period that the revenues are earned thus statutory expenses exclude changes in deferred acquisition costs dac gaap provides for the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the accounting principle of matching therefore acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period the related net premiums written are earned dac is reviewed for recoverability and such review requires management judgment see also critical accounting estimates herein aig along with most general insurance companies uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance the loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized in income as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity regulation product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios general insurance operating income is comprised of statutory underwriting results changes in dac net investment income and realized capital gains and losses operating income as well as net premiums written net premiums earned net investment income and realized

income in the first three months of 2006 showed significant improvement from the prior year results the increase in general insurance operating income in the first three months of 2006 was primarily attributable to improvement in dbgs underwriting results and growth in overall general insurance net investment income underwriting results in the first three months of 2006 and 2005 included 103 million and 171 million respectively of additional losses incurred and net reinstatement premium costs resulting primarily from increased costs related to the 2005 and 2004 catastrophes the 103 million of losses and net reinstatement premium costs incurred in the first three months of 2006 includes 78 million attributable to 2005 hurricanes and 25 million attributable to 2004 hurricanes the losses and net reinstatement premium costs attributable to the 2004 hurricanes are primarily related to multi event and multi location claims that required extensive investigation to determine the full extent and value of the insured damage the 171 million of losses and net reinstatement premium costs incurred in the first three months of 2005 is primarily attributable to 2004 hurricanes as well as 44 million from a january 2005 european storm at march 31 2006 the inception to date incurred losses and net reinstatement premium costs for 2005 hurricanes were approximately 2 7 billion at march 31 2006 the inception to date incurred losses and net reinstatement premium costs for 2004 hurricanes were approximately 1 2 billion dbgs net premiums written increased modestly in the first three months of 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005 reflecting generally improving renewal retention a modest change in the mix of business towards smaller accounts and a reduction in the amount of reinsurance purchased dbg also continued to expand its relationships with a larger number and broader range of brokers recently dbg has seen improvement in domestic property rates as well as increases in submission activity in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes dbg attributes the increase in submissions to its overall financial strength in comparison to many insurers that experienced significant losses and reductions of surplus as a result of the hurricanes the improvement in dbgs underwriting results for the first three months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 was due to a reduction in the loss ratio of 8 1 points primarily due to lower accident year loss ratios for 2006 compared to the loss ratios recorded in the first three months of 2005 for accident year 2005 the improvement in 2006 loss ratios is based on a comprehensive actuarial study conducted at the end of 2005 and updated as of march 31 2006 as described below under quarterly reserving process in addition the first three months of 2006 includes 28 million for losses related to prior year hurricanes compared to the first three months of 2005 which included 118 million for losses related to prior year hurricanes the dbg expense ratio was approximately the same for the first three months of 2006 and 2005 transatlantics net premiums written and net premiums earned for the first three months of 2006 increased compared to the same period of 2005 due largely to increased domestic specialty casualty and property premiums offset in part by the adverse effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international premiums operating income in the first three months of 2006 increased due to improved underwriting profit resulting largely from reduced significant net catastrophe losses and lower net adverse development on loss reserves offset in part by higher commission costs and increased net investment income personal lines net premiums written for the first three months of 2006 increased slightly when compared to the same period of 2005 as strong growth in the private client group and agency auto divisions offset the runoff of the involuntary auto business and a small decline in the aig direct and 21st century divisions the reduction in the involuntary business is a result of terminating an mga relationship the private client group and agency auto divisions continue to grow as they expand their agency broker relationships with multiple product offerings the aig direct and 21st century decline is due largely to a reduction in response rates the loss ratio improved in 2006 due to favorable loss development trends in the aig direct and 21st century businesses the expense ratio increased in 2006 over 2005 driven by an investment in people and technology in the agency auto division higher compensation expenses in 21st century due to implementing fas 123r and accelerated amortization of direct response advertising costs in aig direct resulting from a change in estimated future premiums mortgage guarantys net premiums written were up for the first three months of 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005 strong growth was

three 36 american international group inc and subsidiaries months of 2006 improved slightly from the same period of 2005 as strong earned premium growth was partially offset by loss development in the domestic second lien business foreign general insurance had strong results in the first three months of 2006 even after additional losses incurred related to the 2005 catastrophes and a pre tax adjustment of 53 million to expenses for a write off of deferred advertising costs growth in net premiums written for this period was achieved in consumer lines due to new business as well as new distribution channels commercial lines had modest growth in net premiums written commercial lines in europe exhibited strong growth and had positive results for the first three months of 2006 partially offset by rate decreases in australia and the united kingdom the ascot lloyds syndicate reported growth for this period due to rate increases on its u s book of business along with contractual terms on renewals that reflect better conditions and higher deductibles in the far east personal accident business exhibited strong growth europe southeast asia and latin america also had strong growth in personal accident business personal lines operations in latin america and brazil continue to exhibit strong growth for the first three months of 2006 55 percent of foreign general insurance net premiums written was derived from commercial insurance and the remainder from consumer lines the foreign general insurance loss ratio decreased in the first three months of 2006 from the same period of 2005 primarily due to the lower accident year loss ratio for 2006 compared to the loss ratio recorded in the first three months of 2005 for accident year 2005 the foreign general insurance expense ratio increased in the first three months of 2006 from the same period in 2005 principally due to the 53 million write off of advertising costs aig transacts business in most major foreign currencies the following table summarizes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the growth of general insurance net premiums written for the first three months of 2006 data table removed as previously noted general insurance results include 103 million and 171 million of additional losses incurred and net reinstatement premium costs in the first three months of 2006 and 2005 respectively related primarily to the 2005 and 2004 catastrophes the losses attributable to the 2004 hurricanes are primarily related to multi event and multi location claims that required extensive investigation to determine the full extent and value of the insured damage losses caused by catastrophes can fluctuate widely from year to year making comparisons of recurring type business more difficult with respect to catastrophe losses aig believes that it has taken appropriate steps such as careful exposure selection and obtaining reinsurance coverage to reduce the effect of the magnitude of possible future losses the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity such as a terrorist attack earthquake or hurricane that causes insured losses however could have a material adverse effect on aigs results of operations liquidity or financial condition general insurance net investment income grew in the first three months of 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005 aig is benefiting from strong cash flow and higher interest rates additionally net investment income was positively affected by the compounding of previously earned and reinvested net investment income foreign general insurance net investment income declined in the first three months of 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005 due to lower partnership income market valuations by partnerships in the private equity sector did not match the increases in 2005 the results of which benefited from initial public offering activity of partnership investments realized capital gains and losses resulted from the ongoing investment management of the general insurance portfolios within the overall objectives of the general insurance operations see the discussion on valuation of invested assets herein the contribution of general insurance operating income to aigs consolidated income before income taxes minority interest and cumulative effect of an accounting change was 49 percent in the first three months of 2006 compared to 29 percent in the same period of 2005 reinsurance aig is a major purchaser of reinsurance for its general insurance operations aig insures risks globally and its reinsurance programs must be coordinated in order to provide aig the level of reinsurance protection that aig desires reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention at prudent levels set by management aig also purchases reinsurance to mitigate its catastrophic exposure aig is cognizant of the need to exercise good judgment in the selection and approval of both domestic and foreign companies participating in its reinsurance programs because one or more catastrophe losses could negatively affect aigs reinsurers and result in an inability of aig to collect reinsurance recoverables aigs reinsurance department evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of state of the art industry recognized program models among other techniques aig supplements these models through continually monitoring the risk exposure of aigs worldwide general insurance operations and adjusting such models accordingly although reinsurance ar 37 american international group inc and subsidiaries rangements do not relieve aig from its direct obligations to its insureds an efficient and effective reinsurance program substantially limits aigs exposure to potentially significant losses with respect to its property business aig has either renewed existing coverage or purchased new coverage that in the opinion of management is adequate to limit aigs exposures aigs consolidated general reinsurance assets amounted to 23 44 billion at march 31 2006 and resulted from aigs reinsurance arrangements thus a credit exposure existed at march 31 2006 with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer may not be able to reimburse aig under the terms of these reinsurance arrangements aig manages its credit risk in its reinsurance relationships by transacting with reinsurers that it considers financially sound and when necessary aig holds substantial collateral in the form of funds securities and or irrevocable letters of credit this collateral can be drawn on for amounts that remain unpaid beyond specified time periods on an individual reinsurer basis at december 31 2005 approximately 48 percent of the general reinsurance assets were from unauthorized reinsurers many of these balances were

reinsurer that was financially troubled e g liquidated insolvent in receivership or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction aigs reinsurance security department conducts ongoing detailed assessments of the reinsurance markets and current and potential reinsurers both foreign and domestic such assessments include but are not limited to identifying if a reinsurer is appropriately licensed and has sufficient financial capacity and evaluating the local economic environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates this department also reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the requirements for credit risk mitigants for example in aigs treaty reinsurance contracts aig includes provisions that frequently require a reinsurer to post collateral when a referenced

accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated by management any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in operating income currently because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development at march 31 2006

totaled approximately 4 04 billion at march 31 2006 quarterly reserving process it is managements belief that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover general insurance net losses and loss expenses as of march 31 2006 while aig regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of march 31 2006 in the opinion of management such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated financial position although it could have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period the table below presents the reconciliation of net loss reserves for the first three months ended march 31 2006 and 2005 as follows data table removed includes 35 million in the first three months of 2006 and 55 million in the first three months of 2005 for the general reinsurance operations of transatlantic and 98 million and 118 million of additional losses incurred in the first three months of 2006 and 2005 resulting from increased costs related to the 2005 and 2004 catastrophes the loss ratios recorded by aig for the first three months of 2006 take into account the results of the comprehensive reserve reviews that were completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 as explained more fully in the 2005 annual report on form 10 k aigs year end 2005 reserve review reflected careful consideration of the reserve analyses prepared by aigs internal actuarial staff with the assistance of third party actuaries in determining the appropriate loss ratios for accident year 2006 for each class of business aig gave appropriate consideration to the loss ratios resulting from the reserve analyses as well as all other relevant information including rate changes expected changes in loss costs changes in coverage reinsurance or mix of business and other factors that may affect the loss ratios in the first three months of 2006 aig enhanced its process of determining the quarterly loss development from prior accident years beginning with the first three months of 2006 additional analyses are conducted to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each profit center for example if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years in the quarter the actuaries now take additional steps to examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center as appropriate in the first three months of 2006 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the first three months 40 american international group inc and subsidiaries in the first three months of 2006 net loss development from prior accident years was approximately 35 million including approximately 98 million pertaining to catastrophes in 2004 and 2005 and 35 million from the general reinsurance operations of transatlantic but excluding approximately 101 million pertaining to accretion of loss reserve discount applicable to accident years 2005 and prior excluding catastrophes and transatlantic as well as accretion of discount net loss development from prior accident years in the first three months of 2006 was favorable by approximately 98 million the majority of the 98 million in favorable development is attributable to shorter tail classes of business within foreign general net loss development from prior accident years for dbg in the first three months of 2006 was nearly flat excluding catastrophes and accretion of discount within the overall favorable development of 98 million accident years 2003 through 2005 experienced favorable development of approximately 330 million offset by approximately 230 million of adverse development from accident years 2002 and prior most classes of business throughout aig experienced favorable loss emergence in the first three months of 2006 for accident years 2003 through 2005 the adverse development noted above from accident years 2002 and prior was primarily attributable to the excess casualty class of business and to a lesser extent excess workers compensation after conducting the more enhanced analyses described above aig determined that there was no overall adverse development in the first three months of 2006 for excess casualty whereas there was determined to be 35 million of prior period adverse development for excess workers compensation from accident years 2002 and prior for excess casualty the adverse development for accident years 2002 and prior was offset by favorable development from accident years 2003 and 2004 and to a lesser extent 2005 in the first three months of 2005 net loss reserve development from prior accident years was approximately 143 million including approximately 118 million pertaining to catastrophes in 2004 and 55 million from the general reinsurance operations of transatlantic but excluding approximately 97 million pertaining to the accretion of loss reserve discount pertaining to accident years 2004 and prior excluding catastrophes and transatlantic as well as accretion of discount net loss development from prior accident years in the first three months of 2005 was favorable by approximately 30 million in the first three months of 2005 the overall favorable emergence of 30 million was comprised of approximately 360 million of favorable emergence from accident years 2003 and 2004 offset by approximately 330 million of higher than expected loss emergence from accident years 2002 and prior most classes of business throughout aig contributed to the favorable emergence from accident years 2003 and 2004 in the first three months of 2005 the majority of the higher than expected emergence from accident years 2002 and prior was attributable to the directors and officers and related management liability classes of business as well as excess casualty loss reserving process the general insurance loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups one group is long tail casualty lines of business which include excess and umbrella liability d and o professional liability medical malpractice workers compensation general liability products liability and related classes the other group is short tail lines of business consisting principally of property lines personal lines and certain classes of casualty lines these lines of business and actuarial assumptions made in the review of these lines of business are described in the 2005 annual report on form 10 k the process of determining the current loss ratio for each class or business segment is based on a variety of factors and is described in detail in aigs 2005 annual report on form 10 k aig uses the process described above to update aigs reserves on a quarterly basis aigs 2005 annual report on form 10 k also includes a discussion and analysis of the volatility of aigs 2005 reserve estimates and a sensitivity analysis asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2005 annual report on form 10 k aigs reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect the results of the comprehensive ground up analysis which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 aig plans to update the ground up analysis on an annual basis in the first three months of 2006 aig maintained the ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims resulting from the recently completed reserve analyses

the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at march

of 2006 as deposits declined approximately 7 percent compared to the same period last year while individual variable annuity deposits grew 15 percent and group retirement deposits grew 19 percent overall deposits declined from lower individual fixed annuity deposits individual fixed annuity deposits continued to decline due to the flat yield curve which makes bank products such as certificates of deposit and other money market instruments with shorter duration more attractive than fixed annuities individual variable annuity deposit growth has improved since the introduction of new products in november 2005 primarily products with income and asset accumulation benefits the following table reflects deposits for domestic retirement services for the three months ended march 31 2006 and 2005 data table removed includes mutual funds in the first three months of 2006 surrender rates increased for individual fixed annuities individual variable annuities and group retirement products compared to the first three months of 2005 surrender rates for group retirement products improved modestly when compared to fourth quarter 2005 the increase in surrender rate for fixed annuities continues to be driven by the shape of the yield curve and general aging of the in force block however less than 20 percent of the individual fixed annuity reserves are available to be surrendered without charge individual variable annuity surrenders primarily reflect the higher shock lapse that occurs following expiration of the surrender charge period on certain 3 year and 7 year contracts including a large closed block of acquired business reflecting a widespread industry phenomenon this lapse rate much of which was anticipated when the products were issued has recently been affected by investor demand to exchange existing policies for new generation contracts with living benefits or lower fees in addition partial withdrawals on certain variable annuity products have increased as aig has introduced features designed to generate a stream of income to the participants the following chart shows the amount of reserves by surrender charge category for domestic retirement services as of march 31 2006 data table removed excludes mutual funds a continued increase in the level of surrenders in any of these businesses or in the individual fixed annuities runoff block could accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in future years and will negatively affect fee income earned on assets under management the combination of deposits and surrenders resulted in negative net flows for the

distribution platform in japan where aig remains the leading foreign provider in southeast asia there has been a continuing trend as the market develops for clients to purchase investment oriented products aigs life operations in that region have responded to this trend by offering a wide array of investment linked products both periodic pay and single premium with multiple fund selection but with minimal investment guarantees for gaap reporting purposes only revenues from policy charges for insurance administration and surrender charges are reported as gaap premiums for these life products this product mix shift contributed to the single digit growth rate in foreign life insurance and retirement services gaap premiums while continuing to grow total reserves by double digits japanese tax authorities are expected to announce shortly a reduction in the amount of premium that policyholders may deduct from their japanese tax returns for a certain group of accident and health products foreign life operations in japan experienced a decline in sales of those specific products in the first three months of 2006 however total accident and health sales continued to be strong overall due to growth in sales of core health products and the success of a new cancer insurance product sold by aig edison in the first three months of 2006 japan life operations launched a 45 american international group inc and subsidiaries new product for the corporate market and plans to launch additional products with full tax deductibility in the near future to replace those that will

in policy lapses would not be material to aigs consolidated financial condition or results of operations the foreign retirement services business continued to grow in japan and korea by expanding distribution and leveraging aigs product expertise reserves for individual fixed annuities continue to grow although demand for multi currency fixed annuities in japan has slowed due to currency rate fluctuations and rising local interest rates and equity markets growth of individual variable annuities has accelerated as those products have become more popular with consumers in japan and europe

scenarios to evaluate investment risk and to confirm that assets are sufficient to pay these liabilities aig actively manages the asset liability relationship in its foreign operations as it has been doing throughout aigs history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or certain local regulatory authorities may impose investment restrictions for example in several southeast asian countries the duration of investments is shorter than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities additionally there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities in the first three months of 2006 new money investment yields have been generally rising in some markets such as japan thailand and the u s which is generally favorable to aigs spread based businesses in regard to inforce business management focus is required in both the investment and product management process to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business as such in some countries new products are being introduced with minimal investment guarantees resulting in a shift toward investment linked savings products and away from traditional savings products with higher guarantees the investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity aig may use alternative investments in certain foreign jurisdictions where interest rates remain low and there are limited long dated bond markets including equities real estate and foreign currency denominated fixed income instruments to extend the duration or increase the yield of the investment portfolio to more closely match the requirements of the policyholder liabilities and dac recoverability this strategy has been effectively used in japan and more recently by nan shan in taiwan foreign assets comprised approximately 31 percent of nan shans invested assets at march 31 2006 slightly below the maximum allowable percentage under current regulation in response to the low interest rate environment and the volatile exchange rate of the nt dollar nan shan is emphasizing new products with lower implied guarantees including participating endowments and variable universal life although the risks of a continued low interest rate environment coupled with a volatile nt dollar could increase net liabilities and require additional capital to maintain adequate local solvency margins nan shan currently believes it has adequate resources to meet all future policy obligations aig actively manages the asset liability relationship in its domestic operations this relationship is more easily managed through the ample supply of qualified long term investments aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes in addition the absence of long dated fixed income instruments in certain markets may preclude a matched asset liability position in those markets a number of guaranteed benefits such as living benefits or guaranteed minimum death benefits are offered on certain variable life and variable annuity products aig manages its exposure resulting from these long term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments dac for life insurance and retirement services products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new or renewal business policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy policy acquisition costs that relate to universal life and investment type products including variable and fixed annuities investment oriented products are deferred and amortized with interest as appropriate in relation to the historical and future incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the estimated lives of the contracts

supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date valuation of invested assets aig has the ability to hold any fixed maturity security to its stated maturity including those fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale therefore the decision to sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflects the judgment of aigs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale the valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market value for each security the source for the market value is generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of nontraded securities if aig chooses to hold a security it evaluates the security for an other than temporary impairment in valuation as a 54 american international group inc and subsidiaries matter of policy the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of aigs management and a continual review of its investments in general a security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant 25 percent or more discount to par or amortized cost if lower for an extended period of time nine months or longer the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation or ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or in the opinion of aigs management it is probable that aig may not realize a full recovery on its investment irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events at each balance sheet date aig evaluates its securities holdings in an unrealized loss position where aig does not intend to hold such securities until they have fully recovered their carrying value based on the circumstances present at the date of evaluation aig records the unrealized loss in income if events or circumstances change such as unexpected changes in creditworthiness of the obligor general interest rate environment tax circumstances liquidity events and statutory capital management considerations among others aig revisits its intent to determine if a loss should be recorded in income further if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date pursuant to these changes in circumstances the loss is recognized in the period in which the intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer exists once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price and recorded as a charge to earnings as a result of these policies aig recorded other than temporary impairment losses net of taxes of 147 million and 61 million in the first three months of 2006 and 2005 respectively no impairment charge with respect to any one single credit was significant to aigs consolidated financial condition or results of operations and no

certain air carriers fuel prices and shortages labor stoppages insurance costs recessions world health issues and other political or economic events adversely affecting world or regional trading markets ilfcs revenues and income will be affected by its customers ability to react and cope with the volatile competitive environment in which they operate as well as ilfcs own competitive environment ilfc is exposed to operating loss and liquidity strain through nonperformance of aircraft lessees through owning aircraft which it would be unable to sell or re lease at acceptable rates at lease expiration and in part through committing to purchase aircraft which it would be unable to lease ilfc manages the risk of nonperformance by its lessees with security deposit requirements through repossession rights overhaul requirements and closely monitoring industry conditions through its marketing force however there can be no assurance that ilfc would be able to successfully manage the risks relating to the effect of possible future deterioration in the airline industry approximately 90 percent of ilfcs fleet is leased to non u s carriers and the fleet comprised of the most efficient aircraft in the airline industry continues to be in high demand from such carriers ilfc typically contracts to re lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term for aircraft returned before the end of the lease term ilfc has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return as a lessor ilfc considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent ilfc had no aircraft off lease at march 31 2006 and all new aircraft deliveries in 2006 have been leased see also the

immediately whereas in other in 57 american international group inc and subsidiaries stances they are required to be recognized over the life of the underlying instruments aigfp economically hedges the market risks arising from its transactions although hedge accounting is not currently being applied to any of the derivatives and related assets and liabilities accordingly revenues and operating income are exposed to volatility resulting from differences in the timing of revenue recognition between the derivatives and the hedged assets and liabilities revenues and operating income of the capital markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are also significantly affected by the number size and profitability of transactions entered into by these subsidiaries during that period relative to those entered into during the prior period generally the realization of transaction revenues as measured by the receipt of funds is not a significant reporting event as the gain or loss on aigfps trading transactions is currently reflected in operating income as the fair values change from period to period derivative transactions are entered into in the ordinary course of capital markets operations therefore income on derivatives is recorded at fair value determined by reference to the mark to market value of the derivative or their estimated fair value where market prices are not readily available the resulting aggregate unrealized gains or losses from the derivative are reflected in the income statement where capital markets cannot verify significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model value to market transactions capital markets values the contract at the transaction price at inception and consequently

borrowings on a portfolio basis using derivatives and other financial instruments while these hedges are highly effective economic hedges the requirements under fas 133 hedge accounting were not met the change in the fair value of the derivatives used to hedge these economic exposures is therefore included in other revenues while the offsetting change in fair value of the hedged items is not recognized in earnings consumer finance domestically aigs consumer finance operations are principally conducted through american general finance inc agf agf derives a substantial portion of its

were as follows data table removed data table removed financial services results financial services operating income decreased in the first three months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 due to the effect of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting under fas 133 fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of capital markets operations and the volatility resulting from the accounting treatment for the economic hedges under fas 133 the overwhelming majority of aigs financial derivatives are conducted by the capital markets operations capital markets enters into derivative transactions to hedge the interest rate and foreign currency exposures associated with its available for sale assets and borrowings while the derivatives entered into to hedge its outstanding transactions and positions are highly effective economic hedges aig did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under fas 133 the change in the fair value of these derivatives is included in other revenues while the offsetting change in fair value of the hedged items is not recognized in earnings the effect of the capital markets derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting on revenues and operating income in the first three months of 2006 and 2005 was 678 million and 468 million respectively the majority of the net loss on aigfps derivatives recognized in the first three months of 2006 was due to the rise in long term u s interest rates which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of its interest rate derivatives hedging its borrowings to a lesser extent the net loss was also due to slight weakening in the u s dollar against other currencies resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives hedging aigfps available for sale securities the majority of the net gain on aigfps derivatives in the first three months of 2005 was due to the strengthening of the u s dollar against the euro which increased the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives hedging available for sale securities long term rates remained relatively flat in the first three months of 2005 thus having minimal effect on the fair value of the derivatives hedging aigfps borrowings 59 american international group inc and subsidiaries to the extent the financial services subsidiaries other than aigfp use derivatives to economically hedge their assets or liabilities with respect to their future cash flows and such hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 the changes in fair value of such derivatives are recorded in realized capital gains losses or other revenues financial market conditions in the first three months of 2006 continued to be characterized by a general flattening of interest rate yield curves across fixed income markets globally tightening of credit spreads and equity valuations that were slightly higher the decline in capital markets operating results for the first three months of 2006 was principally due to losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting under fas 133 which was partially offset by improved transaction flow in aigfps credit commodity index and equity products the most significant component of capital markets operating expenses is compensation which was approximately 136 million and 111 million in the first three months of 2006 and 2005 respectively the amount of compensation was not affected by gains and losses not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 as a result of aigs early adoption of fas 155 aigfp elected to apply the fair value option to certain of its structured notes and other financial liabilities containing embedded derivatives outstanding as of january 1 2006 the cumulative effect from the adoption of fas 155 on these instruments at january 1 2006 was a loss of approximately 29 million pre tax the application of the fair value option to these hybrid financial instruments did not have a significant effect on aigfps operating income for the three months ended march 31 2006 ilfcs operating income decreased in the first three months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 as improvements in sales environment and increased lease revenues were offset by increased borrowing costs and certain adjustments for credit and tax reserves and lease related accruals ilfcs revenues increased in the first three months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 as a result of growth in the number of aircraft in ilfcs fleet continued net improvements in lease rates and an increase in overhaul revenue consumer finances operating income decreased in the first three months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 primarily due to the increase in borrowing costs and increases in the allowance for losses related to industry wide credit deterioration in the taiwan credit card market which is going through credit tightening and uncertain regulatory developments domestically the relatively low interest rate environment throughout 2005 and the first three months of 2006 contributed to a high level of mortgage refinancing activity agfs average net finance receivables increased 14 percent in the first three months of 2006 when compared to the same period in 2005 however net originations and purchases of finance receivables in agfs centralized real estate business segment decreased in the first three months of 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005 primarily caused by a less robust u s housing market the increase in agfs revenues that principally resulted from portfolio growth was offset by higher interest expense and depressed whole loan sale prices resulting from a flattened yield curve both short term and long term market interest rates continued to increase significantly over the past year agfs short term and long term borrowing costs were 4 59 percent and 4 84 percent in the first three months of 2006 respectively compared to 3 03 percent and 4 34 percent in the same period in 2005 respectively despite high energy costs the u s economy continued to expand during the first three

aigfp securities available for sale there have been no significant downgrades through march 31 2006 if its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform aigfp could have a liquidity strain aig guarantees aigfps payment obligations including its debt obligations aigfps risk management objective is to minimize interest rate currency commodity and equity risks associated with its securities available for sale that is when aigfp purchases a security for its securities available for sale investment portfolio it simultaneously enters into an offsetting internal hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction offset the payment terms of the investment security which achieves the economic result of converting the return on the underlying security to u s dollar libor plus or minus a spread based on the underlying profit on each security on the initial trade date the market risk associated with such internal hedges is managed on a portfolio basis with third party hedging transactions executed as necessary as hedge accounting treatment is not achieved in accordance with fas 133 the unrealized gains and losses on the securities related economic hedges are reflected in operating income whereas the unrealized gains and losses on the underlying securities resulting from changes in interest rates currency rates commodity and equity prices are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income when a security is sold the related hedging transaction is terminated and the realized gain or loss with respect to this security is then recorded in operating income securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized financing transactions aigfp takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell aigfp further minimizes its credit risk by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and when it deems necessary it requires additional collateral to be deposited aigfp owns inventories in certain commodities in which it trades and may reduce

asset management results asset management operating income decreased in the first three months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 as a result of the continued run off of aigs gic portfolio combined with spread compression in addition there was a decline in realized gains on sales of real estate investments and performance fees earned on various private equity investments the revenues and operating income with respect to the segment are largely affected by the general conditions in the equity and credit markets the decrease for the quarter was primarily due to the decline in the gic business gics were sold domestically and abroad to both institutions and individuals these products were written on an opportunistic basis when the market conditions were favorable a significant portion of the remaining gic portfolio consists of floating rate obligations aig has entered into hedges to manage against increases in short term interest rates aig continues to believe these hedges are economically effective but do not qualify for hedge accounting under fas 133 as a result continued increases in short term interest rates will negatively affect operating income in the segment realized capital gains from the hedges offset the negative trend in operating income gic revenues include income from sun america partnerships supporting the gic line of business and are significantly affected by performance in the equity markets thus revenues operating income and cash flow attributable to gics will vary among reporting periods the decline in gic operating income in the first three months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 reflects tighter spreads in the gic portfolio partially offset by improved net partnership returns spread compression has occurred as the base portfolio yield declined primarily due to an increase in the cost of funds in the short term floating rate portion of the gic portfolio only partially offset by increased investment income from the floating rate assets backing the portfolio as mentioned above the lower level of gains and performance based fees also contributed to the decline in operating income for the first three months of 2006 these gains and performance fees are contingent upon various fund closings maturity levels and market conditions and by their nature are not predictable therefore the effect on the segments earnings

the benefit of counterparties aig believes that any of its or its subsidiaries contractual obligations that are subject to ratings triggers or financial covenants relating to ratings triggers would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or liquidity as a result of the downgrades of aigs long term senior debt ratings aig was required to post approximately 1 16 billion of

collateral it is estimated that as of the close of business on april 30 2006 based on aigs outstanding municipal guaranteed investment agreements and financial derivatives transactions as of such date a further downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings to aa3 by moodys or aa by s and p would permit counterparties to call for approximately 896 million of additional collateral further additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral which could have a material effect on how aig manages its liquidity the actual amount of additional collateral that aig would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions the market value of the outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing

payments of dividends to aig by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities with respect to aigs domestic insurance subsidiaries the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled under the laws of many states an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain regulatory thresholds to enhance their current capital positions dividends from the dbg companies were suspended in the fourth quarter of 2005 and aig has taken various other actions see regulation and supervision below furthermore aig cannot predict how recent regulatory investigations may affect the ability of its

insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by domestic and foreign insurance regulatory authorities the principal differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with u s gaap for domestic companies are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs some bond portfolios may be carried at amortized cost assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance policyholder liabilities are valued using more conservative assumptions and certain assets are non admitted aig recently filed the 2005 statutory financial statements for its domestic general insurance companies after reviewing and agreeing with the relevant state insurance regulators on the statutory accounting treatment of various items the regulatory authorities have also permitted certain of the domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries to support the carrying value of their investments in certain non insurance and foreign insurance subsidiaries by utilizing the aig audited consolidated financial statements to satisfy the requirement that the u s gaap basis equity of such entities be audited in addition the regulatory authorities have permitted the domestic general insurance companies to utilize audited financial statements prepared on a basis of accounting other than u s gaap to value investments in joint ventures limited partnerships and hedge funds these permitted practices did not affect the domestic general insurance companies compliance with minimum regulatory capital requirements statutory capital of each company continued to exceed minimum company action level requirements following the adjustments but aig nonetheless contributed an additional 750 million of capital into american home effective september 30 2005 and contributed a further 2 25 billion of capital in february 2006 for a total of approximately 3 billion of capital into domestic general insurance subsidiaries effective december 31 2005 to enhance their current capital positions dividends from the dbg companies were suspended in the fourth quarter of 2005 aig believes it has the capital resources and liquidity to fund any necessary statutory capital contributions aig will review the capital position of its insurance company subsidiaries with various rating agencies and regulators to determine if additional capital contributions or other actions are warranted as discussed above various regulators have commenced investigations into certain insurance business practices in addition the ots and other regulators routinely conduct examinations of aig and its subsidiaries including aigs consumer finance operations aig cannot predict the ultimate effect that these investigations and examinations or any additional regulation arising therefrom might have on its 69 american international group inc and subsidiaries business federal state or local legislation may affect aigs ability to operate and expand its various financial services businesses and changes in the current laws regulations or interpretations thereof may have a material adverse effect on these businesses see risk factors regulatory investigations in item 1a of part i of aigs 2005 annual report on form 10 k for a further discussion of the effect these investigations may have on aigs businesses aigs u s operations are negatively affected under guarantee fund assessment laws which exist in most states as a result of operating in a state which has guarantee fund assessment laws a solvent insurance company may be assessed for certain obligations arising from the insolvencies of other insurance companies which operated in that state aig generally records these assessments upon notice additionally certain states permit at least a portion of the assessed amount to be used as a credit against a companys future premium tax liabilities therefore the ultimate net assessment cannot reasonably be estimated the guarantee fund assessments net of credits for the first three months of 2006 were 3 million aig is also required to participate in various involuntary pools principally workers compensation business which provide insurance coverage for those not able to obtain such coverage in the voluntary markets this participation is also recorded upon notification as these amounts cannot reasonably be estimated a substantial portion of aigs general insurance business and a majority of its life insurance and retirement services business are conducted in foreign countries the degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies generally aig as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions

foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments up to and including nationalization of aigs operations without compensation adverse effects resulting from any one country may affect aigs results of operations liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and aigs net financial exposure at that time in that country foreign operations are individually subject to local solvency margin requirements that require maintenance of adequate capitalization which aig complies with by country in addition certain foreign locations notably japan have established regulations that can result in guarantee fund assessments these have not had a material effect on aigs operations liquidity aigs liquidity is primarily derived from the operating cash flows of its general and life insurance and retirement services operations management believes that aigs liquid assets its net cash provided by operations and access to short term

returns linked to or derived from some underlying equity debt commodity or other asset liability or index derivatives payments may be based on interest rates and exchange rates and or prices of certain securities commodities financial or commodity indices or other variables the more significant types of derivative arrangements in which aig transacts are swaps forwards futures and options in the normal course of business with the agreement of the original counterparty these contracts may be terminated early or assigned to another counterparty the overwhelming majority of aigs derivatives activities are conducted by the capital markets operations thus permitting aig to participate in the derivatives dealer market acting primarily as principal in these derivative operations aig structures transactions that generally allow its counterparties to obtain or hedge exposure to changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates credit events securities prices and certain commodities and financial or commodity indices aigs customers such as corporations financial institutions multinational organizations sovereign entities government agencies and municipalities use derivatives to hedge their own market exposures for example a futures forward or option contract can be used to protect the customers assets or liabilities against price fluctuations a counterparty may default on any obligation to aig including a derivative contract credit risk is a consequence of extending credit and or carrying trading and investment positions credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to aig to help manage this risk aigfps credit department operates within the guidelines set by the aig credit risk committee this committee establishes the credit policy sets limits for counterparties and provides limits for derivative transactions with counterparties having different credit ratings in addition to credit ratings this committee takes into account other factors including the industry and country of the counterparty transactions which fall outside these pre established guidelines require the specific approval of the aig credit risk committee it is also aigs policy to establish reserves for potential credit impairment when necessary in addition aigfp utilizes various credit enhancements including letters of credit guarantees collateral credit triggers credit derivatives and margin agreements to reduce the credit risk relating to its outstanding financial derivative transactions aigfp requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on among other things the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transactions size and maturity aigs derivatives review committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction or program except those derivative transactions entered into by aigfp with third parties the committee examines among other things the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction its potential credit exposure if any and the estimated benefits managing market risk market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies equities and commodity prices aig has exposures to these risks aig analyzes market risk using various statistical techniques including value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that applies the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors to aigs market positions the output from the var calculation is the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models aig believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management insurance aig has performed a separate var analysis for the general insurance and life insurance and retirement services segments and for each market risk within each segment for purposes of the var calculation the insurance assets and liabilities from gics are included in the life insurance and retirement services segment for the calculations in the analyses the financial instrument assets included are the insurance segments invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued and the financial instrument liabilities included are reserve for losses and loss expenses reserve for unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and other policyholders funds aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aigs insurance segments as of march 31 2006 and december 31 2005 the var number represents the maximum potential loss as of those dates that could be incurred with a 95 percent confidence i e only five percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure within a one month holding period aig uses the historical simulation methodology that entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period aig uses the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices for each scenario each transaction was repriced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values are then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities 72 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of march 31 2006 and december 31 2005 due to diversification effects

life insurance and retirement services segment the increase in combined var and interest rate var in 2006 was primarily the result of growth in the foreign life business in most asian markets interest rates and interest rate volatilities were stable during the quarter financial services aig generally manages its market exposures within financial services by maintaining offsetting positions capital markets seeks to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered market positions credit exposure is managed separately see the discussion on the management of credit risk above aigs market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aigs market exposures particularly those market exposures of the capital markets operations this department determines whether aigs market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aigs senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary ilfc is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates as of march 31 2006 and december 31 2005 aig statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a var model in this analysis the net fair value of aircraft finance operations was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the future servicing of the current debt the estimated effect of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of aircraft finance operations using the historical simulation methodology as previously described as of march 31 2006 and december 31 2005 the average var with respect to the net fair value of aircraft finance operations was approximately 196 million and 129 million respectively in late 2005 ilfc lengthened the average maturity of its debt leading to an increase in its var capital markets operations are exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices aigfp hedges its exposure to these risks primarily through swaps options forwards and futures to economically hedge interest rate risks aigfp may also purchase u s and foreign government obligations aigfp does not seek to manage the market risk of each transaction through an individual third party offsetting transaction rather aigfp takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposures aigfp values the 73 american international group inc and subsidiaries predominant portion of its market sensitive transactions by marking them to market currently through income a smaller portion is priced by estimated fair value based upon an extrapolation of market factors there is another limited portion of transactions where the initial fair value is not recorded through income currently and gains or losses are recognized over the life of the transactions these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfp and aig management the recorded values of these transactions may be different from the values that might be realized if aigfp were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that such differences are not significant to its financial condition or liquidity such differences would be immediately recognized when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity aigfp attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices such as published exchange prices external subscription services such as from bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available aigfp use an internal methodology which includes extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to the dates of the transactions historically actual results have not materially deviated from these models in any material respect systems used by capital markets operations can monitor each units respective market positions on an intraday basis aigfp operates in major business centers overseas and therefore is open for business essentially 24 hours a day thus the market exposure and offset strategies are monitored reviewed and coordinated around the clock aigfp applies various testing techniques which reflect significant potential market movements in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity and equity prices volatility levels and the effect of time these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio the results from these analyses are regularly reviewed by aig management as described above capital markets operations are exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices as well as implied volatilities thereon aig statistically measures the losses of fair value through the application of a var model across capital markets capital markets asset and liability portfolios for which the var analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments derivative instruments and commodities because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale at market is substantially hedged segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary the var calculation is unaffected by the accounting treatment of hedged transactions under fas 133 in the calculation of var for capital markets operations aig uses the same historical simulation methodology described under insurance above which entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period aigfp has recently enhanced its library of factors by including implied option volatilities to construct the historical scenarios for simulation

provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r share based payments fas 123r fas 123r requires that companies use a fair value method to value share based payments and recognize the related compensation expense in net earnings aig adopted fas 123r using the modified prospective application method and accordingly financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation under fas 123r the modified prospective application method provides for the recognition of the fair value with respect to share based compensation for shares subscribed for or granted on or after january 1 2006 and all previously granted but unvested awards as of january 1 2006 the adoption of fas 123r resulted in share based compensation expense of approximately 8 million during the first three months of 2006 related to awards which were accounted for under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees consistent with aigs prospective adoption of the requirements of fas 123 aig did not include the compensation expense related to these awards in its consolidated statement of income instead the effect of these awards was disclosed in the pro forma disclosures required by fas 123 aig expects this expense to approximate 31 million for fiscal 2006 fas 123r also requires aig to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to share based compensation rather than recognizing these forfeitures and corresponding reductions in expense as they occur the pre tax cumulative effect of adoption recognized as a reduction in stock based compensation of 46 million was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change net of tax fas 123r requires aig to reflect the cash savings resulting from excess tax benefits in its financial statements as cash flow from financing activities rather than as cash flow from operating activities as in prior periods the amount of this excess tax benefit for the three months ending march 31 2006 was 1 7 million as a result of fas 123r excluding the cumulative effect of adoption aigs income before income taxes and net income for the three months ended march 31 2006 was 8 million and 5 million respectively lower than if aig had continued to account for share based compensation under fas 123 the effect on basic and diluted earnings for the three months ended march 31 2006 was less than 0 01 per share aig uses a variety of assumptions and a binomial model to calculate the fair value of share based compensation programs the contractual term of options granted is generally 10 years with an expected term of 7 years calculated based on an analysis of historical employee exercise behavior and employee turnover post vesting terminations expected volatility is the average of historical volatility and the implied volatility of actively traded options on aig shares dividend yield is based on the twelve month period prior to the grant date interest rate curves used in the valuation model were the us treasury strip rates with terms from 3 months to 10 years as of
