commerce aig patiently builds relationships in markets around the world where it sees long term growth opportunities for example the fact that aig has the only wholly owned foreign life insurance operations in eight cities in china is the result of relationships developed over nearly 30 years aigs more recent extensions of operations into india vietnam russia and other emerging markets reflect the same growth strategy moreover aig believes in investing in the economies and infrastructures of these countries and growing with them when aig companies enter a new jurisdiction they typically offer both basic protection and savings products as the economies evolve aigs products evolve with them to more sophisticated and investment oriented models growth for aig may be generated both

incurred in the third quarter of 2005 the 2006 periods also included higher general insurance and life insurance and retirement services operating income fluctuations in financial services operating

general insurance operations provide property and casualty products and services throughout the world the increase in general insurance operating income in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2006 compared to the same periods of 2005 was primarily attributable to catastrophe related losses of 2 11 billion in the third quarter of 2005 and the improvement in underwriting results for the domestic brokerage group dbg general insurance operating income included adverse development in the first nine months of 2006 and 2005 from catastrophes in prior years and certain long tail casualty lines which were more than offset by favorable development in other lines operating income for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2006 also increased due to the effect of the out of period adjustments related to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts partially offset by reconciliation adjustments life insurance and retirement services aigs life insurance and retirement services operations provide insurance financial and investment products throughout the world foreign operations provided approximately 65 percent and 61 percent of aigs life

2005 life insurance and retirement services operating income increased 200 million in the third quarter of 2006 from the same period of 2005 results for the quarter were particularly strong in the foreign life operations that were helped by 36 american international group inc and subsidiaries higher investment returns and lower acquisition costs domestic life and retirement services results

related losses in the third quarter of 2005 realized capital losses included in revenues and operating income were 176 million in the third quarter of 2006 compared to realized capital losses of 16 million in the same period of 2005 life insurance and retirement services operating income increased by 9 percent in the first nine months of 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005 due in part to the effect of an out of period adjustment related to the accounting for certain interests in unit investment trusts realized capital losses included in revenues and operating income were 117 million in the first nine months of 2006 compared to realized capital losses of 18 million in the same period of 2005 financial services aigs financial services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing capital market transactions consumer finance and insurance premium financing financial services operating income increased in the third quarter of 2006 and decreased in the first nine months of 2006 compared to the same periods of 2005 primarily due to the effects of hedging activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 financial services operating income in 2005 included catastrophe related losses of 62 million recorded in the third quarter of 2005 resulting from hurricane katrina which were reduced by 22 million in the third quarter of 2006 fluctuations in revenues and operating income from quarter to quarter are not unusual because of the transaction oriented nature of capital markets operations and the effect of not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 for hedges on securities available for sale and borrowings asset management aigs asset management operations include institutional and retail asset management and broker dealer services and aigs spread based investment businesses the aig matched investment program mip which was launched in september of 2005 is replacing aigs gic program as aigs principal spread based investment activity asset management operating income decreased 40 percent for the third quarter of 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005 due to the continued run off of gics and decreased transaction driven fees partially offset by growth in the asset management fees within institutional asset management and income from aigs mip gains and losses arising from the consolidation of certain variable interest entities and partnerships are included in operating income but are offset in minority interest expense which is not a component of operating income operating income decreased 4 percent in the first nine months of 2006 when compared to the same period of 2005 primarily due to the continued run off of gic balances combined with spread compression in the remaining gic portfolio capital resources at september 30 2006 aig had total consolidated shareholders equity of 96 15 billion and total consolidated borrowings of 137 1 billion at that date 122 1 billion of such borrowings were either not guaranteed by aig or were aigfps matched borrowings under obligations of guaranteed investment agreements gias liabilities connected to trust preferred stock or matched notes and bonds payable aig has not purchased any shares of its common stock under its existing common stock repurchase authorization during 2006 liquidity at september 30 2006 aigs consolidated invested assets included 24 14 billion in cash and short term investments consolidated net cash provided from operating activities in the first nine months of 2006 amounted to 6 0 billion aig believes that its liquid assets cash provided by operations and access to the capital markets will enable it to meet its anticipated cash requirements outlook the commercial property and casualty insurance industry has historically experienced cycles of price erosion followed by rate strengthening as a result of catastrophe or other significant losses that affect the overall capacity of the industry to provide coverage despite industry price erosion in some classes of general insurance aig expects to continue to identify profitable opportunities and build attractive new general insurance businesses as a result of aigs broad product line and extensive distribution networks there can be no assurance however that price erosion will not become more widespread or that aigs profitability will not deteriorate from current levels in major commercial lines as well as in personal lines and specialty coverages such as mortgage guaranty where the loss ratio is expected to increase due to softening in the u s housing market and the weakening performance of non traditional mortgage products in december 2005 american international underwriters overseas ltd aiuo received a license from the government of vietnam to operate a wholly owned general insurance company in vietnam this license the first general insurance license granted by vietnam to a u s based insurance organization permits aig to operate a general insurance company throughout vietnam 37 american international group inc and subsidiaries during the second quarter of 2006 the canadian parliament passed legislation that will allow ugc to begin writing business in canada the worlds second largest mortgage guaranty market when provincial licenses are issued in china applications for provincial expansion of aigs life insurance operations in guangdong and jiangsu and of general insurance operations in guangdong were approved in april 2006 aigs wholly owned life insurance operations in eight cities have now been structured into four regional management teams located in shanghai beijing guangdong province and jiangsu province aigs operations are expanding resources in these regions with the opening of additional offices in japan earnings growth for aig star life insurance co ltd and aig edison life insurance company reflects the runoff of the more profitable in force business in comparison to new business currently being generated in may 2006 aig announced the merger of these companies which is expected to enhance the combined entitys ability to grow new business by expanding distribution and gaining efficiency of scale in the fiscal year ended march 31 2006 aigs life operations in japan retained their position as the largest foreign life operation on a total premium basis aig has developed a leadership position in the distribution of annuities through banks in both japan and korea also american life insurance company alico has launched new life products to the japan bank market after further deregulation of banks in december 2005 aig is a leader in direct marketing through sponsors and in the broad market in japan and korea aig also is investing in expanding distribution channels with emphasis in india korea and vietnam domestically aig anticipates its life insurance and retirement services businesses to continue growing in 2006 through distribution channel expansion and new and enhanced products the home service operation which is expected to be a slow growth business has not met business objectives although its cash flow has been strong domestic group life health results continue to be weak resulting in ongoing restructuring activities which may result in the exiting of certain product lines aig retirement services individual fixed annuities business will continue to be challenged due to the interest rate environment and increased competition from bank products while variable annuity products with living benefits will continue to be the product of consumer choice globally heightened regulatory scrutiny of financial services companies in many jurisdictions has the potential to affect future financial results through higher compliance costs or other charges this is particularly true in japan and southeast asia where financial institutions have received an increased number of remediation orders affecting consumer policyholder rights over the last twelve months changes in market conditions in the aircraft leasing business are not immediately apparent in operating results lease rates have firmed as a result of continued demand from the global commercial aviation market especially in asia however higher interest rates are expected to continue to compress lease margins aigs consumer finance operations overseas were negatively affected in the first quarter of 2006 by industry wide credit deterioration in the taiwan credit card market the operating results of aigs consumer finance operations in the u s could be affected by the residential housing market interest rates and unemployment also aig continues to explore opportunities to expand its consumer finance operations into new foreign markets the gic portfolio continues to run off the mip has replaced the gic program as aigs principal spread based investment activity although the mip is beginning to show positive operating income because the asset mix under the mip does not include the alternative investments utilized in the gic program aig does not expect that the income growth in the mip will offset the run off in the gic portfolio for the foreseeable future aig has many promising growth initiatives underway around the world cooperative agreements such as those with picc property and casualty company limited and various banks in the u s japan and korea are expected to expand distribution networks for aigs products and provide models for future growth critical accounting estimates aig considers its most critical accounting estimates those with respect to reserves for losses and loss expenses future policy benefits for life and accident and health contracts deferred policy acquisition costs estimated gross profits for investment oriented products fair value determinations for certain capital markets assets and liabilities other than temporary declines in the value of investments and flight equipment recoverability these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used aigs results of operations would be directly affected throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations aigs critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail the major categories for which assumptions are developed and used to establish each critical accounting estimate are highlighted below reserves for losses and loss expenses and reinsurance recoverable general insurance loss trend factors used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on premium rate adequacy and the projected loss ratio with respect to prior accident years expected loss ratios for the latest accident year for example accident year 2005 for the year end 2005 loss reserve analysis for low frequency high

exchange and volatility rates aig attempts to secure reliable and independent current market price data such as published exchange rates from external subscription services such as bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in its model when such prices are not available aig uses an internal methodology which includes interpolation and extrapolation from verifiable prices from trades occurring on dates nearest to the dates of the transactions other than temporary declines in the value of investments a security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment based upon the following criteria trading at a significant 25 percent or more discount to par or amortized cost if lower for an extended period of time nine months or longer the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the debtor defaulting or seeking bankruptcy or insolvency protection or voluntary reorganization the probability of non realization of a full recovery on its investment irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events at each balance sheet date aig evaluates its securities holdings in an unrealized loss position where aig does not intend to hold such securities until they have fully recovered their carrying value based on the circumstances present at the date of evaluation aig records the unrealized loss in income if events or circumstances change such as unexpected changes in creditworthiness of the obligor general interest rate environment tax circumstances liquidity events and statutory capital management considerations among others aig revisits its intent to determine if a loss should be recorded in income further if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date pursuant to these changes in

structured insurance products also included in dbg are the operations of aig environmental which focuses specifically on providing specialty products to clients with environmental exposures lexington writes surplus lines those risks for which conventional insurance companies do not readily provide insurance coverage either because of complexity or because the coverage does not lend itself to conventional contracts certain of the products of the dbg companies include funding components or have been structured in a manner such that little or no insurance risk is actually transferred funds received in connection with these products are recorded as deposits and are included in other liabilities rather than as premium revenue amounts paid by aig are recorded as reductions to the deposit

methods and multiple distribution channels to write both commercial and consumer lines insurance with certain refinements for local laws customs and needs aiu operates in asia the pacific rim the united kingdom europe africa the middle east and latin america as previously noted aig believes it should present and discuss its financial information in a manner most meaningful to its investors accordingly in its general insurance business aig uses certain regulatory measures where aig has determined these measurements to be useful and meaningful a critical discipline of a successful general insurance business is the objective to produce profit from underwriting activities exclusive of investment related income when underwriting is not profitable premiums are inadequate to pay for insured losses and underwriting related expenses in these situations the addition of general insurance related investment income and realized capital gains may however enable a general insurance business to produce operating income for these reasons aig views underwriting results to be critical in the overall evaluation of performance statutory underwriting profit is derived by reducing net premiums earned by net losses and loss expenses incurred and net expenses incurred statutory accounting generally requires immediate expense recognition and ignores the matching of revenues and expenses as required by gaap that is for statutory purposes expenses are recognized immediately not over the same period that the revenues are earned thus statutory expenses exclude changes in deferred acquisition costs dac gaap provides for the recognition of expenses at the same time revenues are earned the accounting principle of matching therefore acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period the related net premiums written are earned dac is reviewed for recoverability and such review requires management judgment see also critical accounting estimates herein aig along with most general insurance companies uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance the loss ratio is the sum of losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned the expense ratio is statutory underwriting expenses divided by net premiums written the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned or written the cost of losses and statutory expenses respectively the combined ratio presents the total cost per 100 of premium production a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting loss net premiums written are initially deferred and earned based upon the terms of the underlying policies the net unearned premium reserve constitutes deferred revenues which are generally earned ratably over the policy period thus the net unearned premium reserve is not fully recognized in income as net premiums earned until the end of the policy period the underwriting environment varies from country to country as does the degree of litigation activity regulation product type and competition have a direct effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting profit and statutory general insurance ratios 40 american international group inc and subsidiaries general insurance operating income is comprised of statutory underwriting results changes in dac net investment income and realized capital gains and losses

exchange rates on the growth of general insurance net premiums written for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2006 data table removed general insurance results general insurance operating income increased in the third quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 due primarily to the effects of the catastrophes in the third quarter of 2005 other factors contributing to the increase were an improvement in statutory underwriting profit for dbg as a result of improved loss ratios for the current accident year compared to the loss ratios recorded in the third quarter of 2005 for accident year 2005 as well as growth in net investment income the combined ratio improved to 89 1 during the third quarter of 2006 a reduction of 23 0 points from the same period in 2005

actuaries now take additional steps to examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center as appropriate in the first second and third quarters of 2006 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the first second and third quarters of 2006 as part of its quarterly reserving process aig also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues such as those related to stock option backdating in the third quarter of 2006 net loss

classes of casualty lines these lines of business and actuarial assumptions made in the review of these lines of business are described in the 2005 annual report on form 10 k a the process of

described above to update aigs reserves on a quarterly basis aigs 2005 annual report on form 10 k a also includes a discussion and analysis of the volatility of aigs 2005 reserve estimates and a sensitivity analysis asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2005 annual report on form 10 k a aigs reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect the results of the comprehensive ground up analysis which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 aig is in the process of updating its ground up analysis and expects to continue to do so on an annual basis in the first nine months of 2006 aig maintained the ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims resulting from the recently completed reserve analyses a minor amount of incurred loss emergence pertaining to asbestos was reflected in the first nine months of 2006 as depicted in the table that follows this minor development is primarily

payments increased significantly in the first nine months of 2006 compared to the same period in the prior years primarily as a result of payments pertaining to settlements that had been negotiated in

summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity for the nine months ended september 30 2006 and 2005 was as follows data table removed the table below presents aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at september 30 2006 and 2005 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the 2006 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at december 31 2005 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at september 30 2006 and 2005 were as follows data table removed life insurance and retirement

business are growing moderately annuity deposits are down 49 million and group mutual fund deposits are up 69 million for the third quarter of 2006 when compared to the same period last year due to market demand for lower cost group retirement products over time this will result in a gradual reduction in profitability of this business due to lower profit margins in the mutual fund product compared to the annuity product group retirement products earnings for the third quarter of 2006 were lower than the same period last year principally due to lower partnership income and higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs related to internal replacements of existing contracts into new contracts individual fixed annuity earnings grew 9 percent for the third quarter of 2006 compared to the same period last year as a result of increased net investment spreads and lower dac amortization due to realized capital losses earnings for individual variable annuities grew 7

individual variable annuity surrender rates for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2006 primarily reflect higher shock lapses that occur following expiration of the surrender charge period on certain 3 year and 7 year contracts although the trend has moderated during the year reflecting a widespread industry phenomenon this lapse rate much of which was anticipated when the products were issued has recently been affected by investor demand to exchange existing policies for new generation contracts with living benefits or lower fees in addition the high lapse rates are in part due to the surrenders within certain acquired blocks of business a further increase in the level of surrenders in any of these businesses or in the individual fixed annuities runoff block could accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and negatively affect fee income earned on assets under management the following table reflects the net flows by line of business for domestic retirement services for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2006 and 2005 data table removed a net flows are defined as deposits received less benefits surrenders withdrawals and death benefits b

services results foreign life insurance and retirement services operations produced 78 percent and 77 percent of life insurance and retirement services gaap premiums for the three months ended september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively foreign life insurance and retirement services gaap premiums increased in the third quarter of 2006 by approximately 8 percent compared to the same period in

growth is affected by a continuing trend for clients to purchase investment oriented products this is particularly true in southeast asia including taiwan where aigs life operations in that region have responded to this trend by offering a wide array of investment linked products both periodic pay and single premium with multiple fund selection but with minimal investment guarantees for gaap reporting purposes only revenues from policy charges for insurance administration and surrender charges are reported as gaap premiums for these life products this product mix shift contributed to the

reflect continued stable profit margins and revenue growth group products earnings grew in the third quarter of 2006 due to improved mortality and morbidity costs when compared to the same period last year growth of individual fixed annuities earnings for the third quarter of 2006 emanating primarily from japan is in line with the growth in average assets under management and lower acquisition costs from dac unlocking the growth of individual variable annuities earnings in the third quarter of 2006 reflects continued growth in assets under management related to the increased demand for those products in japan and in europe during the second quarter of 2006 japanese tax authorities announced a reduction in the amount of premium that policyholders may deduct from their japanese tax returns for certain accident and health products foreign life operations in japan continued to experience a decline in sales of those products and an increase in terminations during the quarter which resulted in approximately 23 million of higher expenses this negative effect was more than offset by a 29 million benefit to operating income from the personal accident line of business as a result of an actuarial change in estimate if terminations continue at current experience levels results will continue to be negatively affected higher than anticipated terminations result in accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs offset somewhat by the release of policy benefit reserves in excess of cash value the amount of deferred acquisition costs related to the policies in force

the obligations of the expected policy and contract liabilities and the necessary return on investments see also the discussion under liquidity herein to minimize its exposure to investment risk aig tests the cash flows from the invested assets and policy and contract liabilities using various interest rate scenarios to evaluate investment risk and to confirm that assets are sufficient to pay these liabilities aig actively manages the asset liability relationship in its foreign operations as it has been doing throughout aigs history even though certain territories lack qualified long term investments or certain local regulatory authorities may impose investment restrictions for example in several southeast asian countries the duration of investments is shorter than the effective maturity of the related policy liabilities therefore there is risk that the reinvestment of the proceeds at the maturity of the initial investments may be at a yield below that of the interest required for the accretion of the policy liabilities additionally there exists a future investment risk associated with certain policies currently in force which will have premium receipts in the future that is the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities in the first nine months of 2006 new money investment rates have generally risen in the u s and japan and have generally fallen in taiwan and thailand in regard to inforce business management focus is required in both the investment and product management process to maintain an adequate yield to match the interest necessary to support future policy liabilities business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business as such in some countries new products are being introduced with minimal investment guarantees resulting in a shift toward investment linked savings products and away from traditional savings products with higher guarantees the investment of insurance cash flows and reinvestment of the proceeds of matured securities and coupons requires active management of investment yields while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity aig may use alternative investments in certain foreign jurisdictions where interest rates remain low and there are limited long dated bond markets including equities real estate and foreign currency denominated fixed income instruments to extend the duration or increase the yield of the investment portfolio to more closely match the requirements of the policyholder liabilities and dac recoverability this strategy has been effectively used in japan and more recently by nan shan in taiwan foreign assets comprised approximately 32 percent of nan

endowment insurance products with implicit interest rate guarantees new business with lower interest rate guarantees are gradually reducing the overall interest requirements but asset portfolio yields have declined faster due to the prolonged low interest rate environment as a result although the investment margins for a large block of in force policies are negative the block remains profitable because the mortality and expense margins presently exceed the negative investment spread in response to the low interest rate environment and the volatile exchange rate of the nt dollar nan shan is 63 american international group inc and subsidiaries emphasizing new products with lower implied guarantees including participating endowments and investment linked products although the risks of a continued low interest rate environment coupled with a volatile nt dollar could increase net liabilities and require additional capital to maintain adequate local solvency margins nan shan currently believes it has adequate resources to meet all future policy obligations aig actively manages the asset liability relationship in its domestic operations this relationship is more easily managed through the availability of qualified long term investments aig uses asset liability matching as a management tool worldwide to determine the composition of the invested assets and appropriate marketing strategies as a part of these strategies aig may determine that it is economically advantageous to be temporarily in an unmatched position due to anticipated interest rate or other economic changes in addition the absence of long dated fixed income instruments in certain markets may preclude a matched asset liability position in those markets a number of guaranteed benefits such as living benefits or guaranteed minimum death benefits are offered on certain variable life and variable annuity products aig manages its exposure resulting from these long term guarantees through reinsurance or capital market hedging instruments dac for life insurance and retirement services products arises from the deferral of those costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new or renewal business policy acquisition costs for life insurance products are generally deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the policy policy acquisition costs

to be realized from these contracts are revised with respect to variable annuities sold domestically representing the vast majority of aigs variable annuity business the assumption for the long term annual net growth rate of the equity markets used in the determination of dac amortization is approximately ten percent a methodology referred to as reversion to the mean is used to maintain this long term net growth rate assumption while giving consideration to short term variations in equity markets estimated gross profits include investment income and gains and losses less interest required on policyholder reserves as well as other charges in the contract less actual mortality and expenses current experience and changes in the expected future gross profits are analyzed to determine the

supporting the policy liabilities in the country of issuance any fixed income security may be subject to downgrade for a variety of reasons subsequent to any balance sheet date valuation of invested assets aig has the ability to hold any fixed maturity security to its stated maturity including those fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale therefore the decision to sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflects the judgment of aigs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale the valuation of invested assets involves obtaining a market value for each security the source for the market value is generally from market exchanges or dealer quotations with the exception of nontraded securities aig periodically evaluates its securities for other than temporary impairments in valuation as a matter of policy 69 american international group inc and subsidiaries the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value and the amount of any loss recognition requires the judgment of aigs management and a continual review of its investments in general a security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant 25 percent or more discount to par or amortized cost if lower for an extended period of time nine months or longer the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation or ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their

sheet date aig evaluates its securities holdings in an unrealized loss position where aig does not intend to hold such securities until they have fully recovered their carrying value based on the circumstances present at the date of evaluation aig records the unrealized loss in income if events or circumstances change such as unexpected changes in creditworthiness of the obligor general interest rate environment tax circumstances liquidity events and statutory capital management considerations among others aig revisits its intent to determine if a loss should be recorded in income further if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date pursuant to these changes in circumstances the loss is recognized in the period in which the intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer exists once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous market price and recorded as a charge to earnings as a result of these policies aig recorded in realized capital gains losses other than temporary impairment pre tax losses of 170

through its marketing force however there can be no assurance that ilfc would be able to successfully manage the risks relating to the effect of possible future deterioration in the airline industry approximately 90 percent of ilfcs fleet is leased to non u s carriers and the fleet comprised of the most efficient aircraft in the airline industry continues to be in high demand from such carriers ilfc typically contracts to re lease aircraft before the end of the existing lease term for aircraft returned before the end of the lease term ilfc has generally been able to re lease such aircraft within two to six months of its return as a lessor ilfc considers an aircraft idle or off lease when the aircraft is not subject to a signed lease agreement or signed letter of intent ilfc had one

value of aigfps derivatives hedging its assets and liabilities this net loss was slightly offset by the strengthening of the u s dollar primarily against the euro and british pound which increased the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives hedging available for sale securities financial market conditions in the third quarter of 2006 were characterized by lower levels of interest rates globally unchanged credit spreads and higher equity valuations the increase in capital markets operating income for the third quarter of 2006 was principally due to gains on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting under fas 133 aigfps transaction flow in credit commodity and equity products improved during the third quarter of 2006 compared to the third quarter of 2005 although this was more than offset by reduced revenues from other product groups the most significant component of capital markets operating expenses is compensation which was approximately 115 million and 138 million in the third quarter of 2006 and 2005 respectively the amount of compensation was not affected by gains and losses not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 aig elected to early adopt fas 155 in 2006 and accordingly aigfp has elected to account for a significant majority of its hybrid financial instruments at fair value the change in fair value of these hybrid financial instruments is included in operating income aigfp economically hedges these hybrid financial instruments with other derivative positions with third parties the change in fair value of these positions is reflected in operating income the net effect of these hybrid financial instruments and the derivatives economically hedging these instruments had a minimal effect on aigfps operating income for the third quarter of 2006 year to date capital markets results capital markets operating income in the nine month period ended september 30 2006 decreased by 2 76 billion compared to the same period of 2005 improved results primarily from increased transaction flow in aigfps credit commodity index and equity products were more than offset by the loss resulting from the effect of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment of 1 06 billion in the current period compared to a gain of 1 80 billion in the comparable period last year a decrease of 2 86 billion a large part of the net loss on aigfps derivatives recognized in the first nine months of 2006 was due to the weakening of the u s dollar primarily against the british pound and euro resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives hedging aigfps available for sale securities the majority of the net gain on aigfps derivatives in the first nine months of 2005 was due to the strengthening of the u s dollar primarily against the british pound and euro which increased the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives hedging available for sale securities to a lesser extent the net gain in 2005 was due to the decrease in long term u s interest rates which 75 american international group inc and subsidiaries increased the fair value of derivatives hedging aigfps assets and liabilities financial market conditions in the first nine months of 2006 were characterized by a general flattening of interest rate yield curves across fixed income markets globally tightening of credit spreads and equity valuations that were higher the compensation expense of capital markets was approximately 380 million and 359 million in the first nine months of 2006 and 2005 respectively the amount of compensation was not affected by gains and losses not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 as a result of aigs early adoption of fas 155 aigfp elected to apply the fair value option to its structured notes and other financial liabilities containing embedded derivatives outstanding as of january 1 2006 the cumulative effect from the adoption of fas 155 on these instruments at january 1 2006 was a loss of approximately 29 million pre tax the application of the fair value option to these hybrid financial instruments did not have a significant effect on aigfps operating income for the first nine months of 2006 quarterly consumer finance results consumer finance operating income increased in the third quarter of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 in the domestic operations and decreased slightly in foreign operations domestically the relatively low interest rate environment throughout 2005 contributed to a high level of mortgage refinancing activity agfs

centralized real estate business segment decreased in the third quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 primarily caused by a less robust u s housing market the increase in agfs revenues that principally resulted from portfolio growth was offset by higher interest expense and depressed whole loan sale prices resulting from a flattened yield curve both short term and long term market

30 2005 revenues from foreign consumer finance operations increased by approximately 15 percent in the third quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 loan growth was the primary driver behind higher revenues in 2006 higher revenues were offset by higher loan loss provisions due to loan growth and higher operating expenses in connection with expansion of distribution channels and new product promotions resulting in slightly lower operating income for the third quarter of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 year to date consumer finance results consumer finance operating income decreased in the first nine months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 the domestic operations remain essentially unchanged year over year while the foreign operations decreased

20 percent in the first nine months of 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 loan growth was the primary driver behind higher revenues higher revenues were more than offset by increases in the allowance for losses related to industry wide credit deterioration in the taiwan credit card market increased cost of funds and higher operating expenses in connection with expansion of distribution

deposits and various borrowings including commercial paper and medium term notes aigs consumer finance operations are exposed to credit risk and risk of loss resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates over half of the finance receivables are real estate loans which are substantially collateralized by the related properties with respect to credit losses the allowance for losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated credit losses existing in that portfolio as of the balance sheet date capital markets derivative transactions are carried at market value or at estimated fair value when market prices are not readily available aigfp reduces its economic risk exposure through similarly valued offsetting transactions including swaps trading securities options forwards and futures the estimated fair values of these transactions represent assessments of the present value of expected future cash flows these transactions are exposed to liquidity risk if aigfp were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that the effect of any such event would not be significant to aigs financial condition or its

investment grade at september 30 2006 amounted to approximately 259 million in fair value representing 0 6 percent of the total aigfp securities available for sale there have been no significant downgrades through september 30 2006 if its securities available for sale portfolio were to suffer significant default and the collateral held declined significantly in value with no replacement or the credit default swap counterparty failed to perform aigfp could have a liquidity strain aig guarantees aigfps payment obligations including its debt obligations aigfps risk management objective is to minimize interest rate currency commodity and equity risks associated with its securities available for sale that is when aigfp purchases a security for its securities available for sale investment portfolio it simultaneously enters into an offsetting internal hedge such that the payment terms of the hedging transaction offset the payment terms of the investment security which achieves the economic result of converting the return on the underlying security to u s dollar libor plus or minus a spread based on the underlying profit on each security on the initial trade date the market risk associated with such internal hedges is managed on a portfolio basis with third party hedging transactions executed as necessary as hedge accounting treatment is not achieved in accordance with fas 133 the unrealized gains and losses on the derivative transactions with unaffiliated third parties are reflected in operating income whereas the unrealized gains and losses on the underlying securities available for sale resulting from changes in interest rates currency rates commodity and equity prices are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income when a security is sold the realized gain or loss with respect to this security is then recorded in operating income securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as collateralized financing transactions aigfp takes possession of or obtains a security interest in securities purchased under agreements to resell aigfp owns inventories in certain commodities in which it trades and may reduce the exposure to market risk through the use of swaps forwards futures and option contracts physical commodities held in aigfps wholly owned broker dealer subsidiary are recorded at market value all other commodities

30 2006 operating income includes 47 million and 203 million respectively of third party limited partner earnings offset in minority interest expense which is not a component of operating income quarterly asset management results asset management operating income decreased 40 percent in the third quarter of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 on revenues that declined 9 percent due to the continued run off of gic balances combined with spread compression in the remaining gic portfolio the spread compression has occurred due to an increase in the cost of funds in the short term floating rate portion of the gic portfolio only partially offset by increased investment income from the floating rate assets backing the portfolio 79 american international group inc and subsidiaries operating income in the third quarter of 2006 also declined from the year ago quarter due to lower transaction driven revenues that were partially offset by growth in asset based management fees within institutional asset management the gic portfolio continues to run off the mip has replaced the gic program as aigs principal spread based investment activity although the mip is beginning to show positive operating income because the asset mix under the mip does not include the alternative investments utilized in the gic program aig does not expect that the income growth in the mip will offset the run off in the gic portfolio for the foreseeable future a significant portion of the remaining gic portfolio consists of floating rate obligations aig has entered into hedges to manage against increases in short term interest rates aig continues to believe these hedges are economically effective but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 as a result continued increases in short term interest rates will negatively affect operating income in the segment realized capital gains from the hedges offset the negative trend in gic related operating income gic revenues include income from sun america partnerships supporting the gic line of business and are significantly affected by performance in the equity markets thus revenues operating income and cash flow attributable to gics will vary among reporting periods the mip was initially launched in the euromarkets in september 2005 through aigs 10 billion euro medium term note program through september 30 2006 aig has issued the equivalent of 3 3 billion for the mip in the euro u s rule 144a and u s public markets the revenues and operating income for this segment are largely affected by the general conditions in the equity and credit markets realized gains and performance fees are contingent upon various fund closings maturity levels and market conditions and by their nature are not predictable therefore the segments earnings may vary from period to period year to date asset management results asset management revenues and operating income decreased 4 percent in the first nine months of 2006 compared to the same period of 2005 due to the decline in operating income from the gic portfolio reflecting the continued run off of gic balances combined with spread compression in the remaining gic portfolio the decrease in revenues and operating income was partially offset by growth in asset management fees in institutional asset management at september 30 2006 and 2005 aigs non affiliated client assets under management including both retail mutual funds and institutional accounts were approximately 70 billion and 59 billion and the aggregate gic reserve was 49 2 billion and 49 7 billion respectively other operations the operating income loss for other operations for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2006 and 2005 was as follows data table removed other operating loss amounted to 470 million and 356 million in the three month periods ended september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively as interest expense increased primarily reflecting increased borrowings by the parent holding company the third quarter of 2006 also reflects net realized capital losses primarily reflecting the effect of hedging activities of the financial services and asset management segments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under fas 133 partially offset by a gain in the parent company of 86 million from the sale of aigs investment in ipc holdings ltd these declines were partially offset by increased equity earnings in certain unconsolidated subsidiaries driven primarily by a decrease in catastrophe losses of 246 million the third quarter of 2006 also reflects a decrease in compensation expense with respect to the sico plans and income of 21 million resulting from a change in accounting estimate relating to a favorable resolution of a litigation matter other operating loss amounted to 1 17 billion and 445 million in the nine month periods ended september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively as interest expense increased primarily reflecting increased borrowings by the parent holding company the first nine months of 2006 also reflects net realized capital losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph and an increase in unallocated corporate expenses reflecting expenses of 29 million in the first nine months of 2006 relating to certain executive departures of which approximately 18 million related to departures in 2005 and an overall increase in corporate operating expenses primarily resulting from on going efforts to improve internal controls at the parent holding company also reflected in operating loss in the first nine months of 2006 is an out of period adjustment totaling 61 million with respect to the sico plans and a one time charge related to the starr tender offer of 54 million both of which were recorded in the first quarter of 2006 see also note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion these declines 80 american international group inc and subsidiaries were partially offset by increased equity earnings in certain unconsolidated subsidiaries and income of 21 million resulting from a change in accounting estimate as discussed in the preceding paragraph capital

credit risk exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to aig to help manage this risk aigfps credit department operates within the guidelines set by the aig credit

transactions aigfp requires credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on among other things the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the transactions size and maturity aigs derivatives review committee provides an independent review of any proposed derivative transaction or program except those derivative transactions entered into by aigfp with third parties the committee examines among other things the nature and purpose of the derivative transaction its potential credit exposure if any and the estimated benefits managing risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies equities and commodity prices aig has exposures to these risks aig analyzes market risk using various statistical techniques including value at risk var var is a summary statistical measure that applies the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors to aigs market positions the output from the var calculation is the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability while var models are relatively sophisticated the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models aig believes that statistical models alone do 89 american international group inc and subsidiaries not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk therefore such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management insurance aig has performed a separate var analysis for the general insurance and life insurance and retirement services segments and for each market risk within each segment for purposes of the var calculation the insurance assets and liabilities from gics are included in the life insurance and retirement services segment for the calculations in the analyses the financial instrument assets included are the insurance segments invested assets excluding real estate and investment income due and accrued and the financial instrument liabilities included are reserve for losses and loss expenses unearned premiums future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and other policyholders funds aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of each of aigs insurance segments as of september 30 2006 and december 31 2005 the var number represents the maximum potential loss as of those dates that could be incurred with a 95 percent confidence i e only five percent of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figure within a one month holding period aig uses the historical simulation methodology that entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period aig uses the most recent three years of historical market information for interest rates foreign exchange rates and equity index prices for each scenario each transaction was repriced portfolio business unit and finally aig wide scenario values are then calculated by netting the values of all the underlying assets and liabilities the following table presents the period end average high and low vars on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for each of aigs insurance segments as of september 30 2006 and december 31 2005 due to diversification effects the combined var is always smaller than the sum of its components data table removed the calculations of equity var for the life insurance and retirement services segment shown above for all 2006 periods include structured exposures and exposures related to equity linked guarantees on variable annuity products these exposures are not included in the equity var calculations for the 2005 periods in the life insurance and retirement services segment the combined var is near the low point in the range for 2006 and is similar to the combined var at the end of 2005 the equity var increase during 2006 did not cause a corresponding increase in combined var due to both diversification effects and to declines in interest rate volatilities which reduced interest rate var during 2006 financial services aig generally manages its market exposures within financial services by maintaining offsetting positions capital markets seeks to minimize or set limits for open or uncovered market positions credit exposure is managed separately see the discussion on the management of credit risk above aigs market risk management department provides detailed independent review of aigs market exposures particularly those market exposures of the capital markets operations this department determines whether aigs market risks as well as those market risks of individual subsidiaries are within the parameters established by aigs senior management well established market risk management techniques such as sensitivity analysis are used additionally this department verifies that specific market risks of each of certain subsidiaries are managed and hedged by that subsidiary ilfc is exposed to market risk and the risk of loss of fair value and possible liquidity strain resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates as of september 30 2006 and december 31 2005 aig statistically measured the loss of fair value through the application of a var model in this analysis the net fair value of aircraft finance operations was determined using the financial instrument assets which included the tax adjusted future flight equipment lease revenue and the financial instrument liabilities which included the 90 american international group inc and subsidiaries future servicing of the current debt the estimated effect of the current derivative positions was also taken into account aig calculated the var with respect to the net fair value of aircraft finance operations using the historical simulation methodology as previously described as of september 30 2006 and december 31 2005 the average var with respect to the net fair value of aircraft finance operations was approximately 165 million and 129 million respectively in late 2005 ilfc lengthened the average maturity of its debt leading to an increase in its var capital markets operations are exposed to market risk due to changes in the level and volatility of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices aigfp hedges its exposure to these risks primarily through swaps options forwards and futures to economically hedge interest rate risks aigfp may also purchase u s and foreign government obligations aigfp does not seek to manage the market risk of each transaction through an individual third party offsetting transaction rather aigfp takes a portfolio approach to the management of its market risk exposures aigfp values the predominant portion of its market sensitive transactions by marking them to market currently through income a smaller portion is priced by estimated fair value based upon an extrapolation of market factors there is another limited portion of transactions where the initial fair value is not recorded through income currently and gains or losses are recognized over the life of the transactions these valuations represent an assessment of the present values of expected future cash flows and may include reserves for such risks as are deemed appropriate by aigfp and aig management the recorded values of these transactions may be different from the values that might be realized if aigfp were required to sell or close out the transactions prior to maturity aig believes that such differences are not significant to its financial condition or liquidity such differences would be immediately recognized in income when the transactions are sold or closed out prior to maturity aigfp attempts to secure reliable and independent current market prices such as published exchange prices external subscription services such as from bloomberg or reuters or third party broker quotes for use in this model when such prices are not available aigfp use an internal methodology which includes extrapolation from observable and verifiable prices nearest to the measurement date of the reporting period historically actual results have not materially deviated from these models in any material respect systems used by capital markets operations can monitor each units respective market positions on an intraday basis aigfp operates in major business centers overseas and therefore is open for business essentially 24 hours a day thus the market exposure and offset strategies are regularly monitored reviewed and coordinated aigfp applies various testing techniques which reflect significant potential market movements in interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity and equity prices volatility levels and the effect of time these techniques vary by currency and are regularly changed to reflect factors affecting the derivatives portfolio the results from these analyses are regularly reviewed by aig management as described above capital markets operations are exposed to the risk of loss of fair value from adverse fluctuations in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates and equity and commodity prices as well as implied volatilities thereon aig statistically measures the losses of fair value through the application of a var model across capital markets capital markets asset and liability portfolios for which the var analyses were performed included over the counter and exchange traded investments derivative instruments and commodities because the market risk with respect to securities available for sale at market is substantially hedged segregation of market sensitive instruments into trading and other than trading was not deemed necessary the var calculation is unaffected by the accounting treatment of hedged transactions under fas 133 in the calculation of var for capital markets operations aig uses the same historical simulation methodology described under insurance above which entails repricing all assets and liabilities under explicit changes in market rates within a specific historical time period the following table presents the var on a combined basis and of each component of market risk for

business exposes it to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year in order to control this exposure aig uses a combination of techniques including setting aggregate limits in key business units monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections aig evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of third party models generally recognized as industry standards following is an overview of modeled losses associated with the more significant natural perils the modeled results assume that all reinsurers perform their obligations to aig in accordance with their terms it is important to recognize that there is no standard methodology to project the possible losses from total property and workers compensation exposures and that the use of different models could result in materially different projected losses further there are no industry standard assumptions to be utilized in projecting these losses the use of different assumptions could materially change the projected losses therefore these modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not reflect aigs maximum exposures to these events it is highly likely that aigs losses will vary perhaps significantly from these estimates natural catastrophe exposures the modeled results provided in the table below were based on the aggregate exceedence probability aep losses which represent total property and workers compensation losses that may occur in any single year from one or more natural events the model which has been updated to reflect 2005 catastrophes generally used 2005 exposure data and the current reinsurance program structure the values provided were based on 100 year return period losses which have a 1 percent likelihood of being exceeded in any single year thus there is a one percent probability that aig could incur in any year losses in excess of the modeled amounts for these perils data table removed in addition aig also evaluates potential single event earthquake and hurricane losses that may be incurred the single events utilized are a subset of potential events identified and utilized by lloyds1and referred to as realistic disaster scenarios rdss the purpose of this analysis was to utilize these rdss to provide a reference frame and place into context the model results however it is important to note that the specific events used for this analysis do not necessarily represent the worst case loss that aig could incur from this type of an event in these regions the losses associated with the rdss are included in the table below single event modeled property and workers compensation losses to aigs worldwide portfolio of risk for key geographic areas gross values represent aigs liability after the application of policy limits and deductibles and net values represent losses after all reinsurance is applied data table removed because the specific international rds events do not necessarily correspond to aigs international exposures aig also runs simulations against its own exposures where statistical return period losses associated with the written exposure specific to aigs exposures provide the basis for monitoring risk based on these simulations the 100 year return period for japanese earthquake is 359 million gross and 113 million net the 100 year return period for european windstorm is 168 million gross and 54 million net and the 100 year return period for the japanese typhoon is 313 million gross and 260 million net actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and the occurrence of one or 1 lloyds realistic disaster scenarios scenario specifications april 2006 92 american international group inc and subsidiaries more severe events could have a material adverse effect on aigs financial condition results of operations and liquidity measures implemented to control hurricane and earthquake catastrophic risk catastrophic risk from the earthquake and hurricane perils is proactively managed through reinsurance programs and aggregate accumulation monitoring catastrophe reinsurance is purchased by aig from financially sound reinsurers recoveries under this program along with other non catastrophic reinsurance protections are reflected in the net values provided in the tables above in addition to the catastrophic reinsurance programs hurricane and earthquake exposures are also controlled by monitoring aggregate exposures on a regular basis the aggregate exposures are calculated by compiling total liability within aig defined hurricane and earthquake catastrophe risk zones and therefore represent the maximum that could be lost in any individual zone these aggregate accumulations are tracked over time in order to monitor both long and short term trends aigs major property writers lexington and the private client group have also implemented catastrophe related underwriting procedures and manage their books at an account level lexington individually models most accounts prior to binding in order to specifically quantify catastrophic risk for each account pandemic influenza the potential for a pandemic influenza outbreak has received media attention during the past year aig continues to analyze its exposure to this serious threat and as such has engaged an external risk management firm to model loss scenarios associated with an outbreak of avian flu using a 1 in 100 year return period aig estimates its after tax net losses under its life insurance policies due to avian flu at approximately 0 9 percent of consolidated shareholders equity as of december 31 2005 this estimate was calculated over a 3 year period although the majority of the losses would be incurred in the first year the modeled losses calculated were based on 2005 policy data representing approximately 90 percent of aigs individual life group life and credit life books of business net of reinsurance this estimate does not include claims that could be made under other policies such as business interruption or general liability policies and does not reflect estimates for losses resulting from disruption of aigs own business operations that may arise out of such a pandemic the model used to generate this estimate has only recently been developed
