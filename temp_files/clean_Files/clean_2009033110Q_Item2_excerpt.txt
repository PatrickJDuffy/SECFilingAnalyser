below are not consummated if one or more of these possible outcomes is realized aig may need additional u s government support to meet its obligations as they come due capital resources and liquidity liquidity liquidity events in the second half of 2008 in the second half of 2008 aig experienced an unprecedented strain on liquidity the two principal causes of the liquidity strain were demands for the return of cash collateral under the u s securities lending program and collateral calls on aigfps super senior multi sector collateralized debt obligation cdo credit default swap portfolio both of these liquidity strains were significantly exacerbated by the downgrades of aigs long term debt ratings by standard and poors a division of the mcgraw hill companies inc s and p moodys investors service moodys and fitch ratings fitch on september 15 2008 this strain led to a series of transactions with the frbny and the department of the treasury see the 2008 annual report on form 10 k for a

at april 30 2009 aig had not drawn any amounts under the department of the treasury commitment and therefore had additional capacity to draw up to 29 835 billion thereunder 72 american international

international group inc and subsidiaries additional sources of liquidity for aig are detailed in liquidity of parent and subsidiaries below aigs strategy for stabilization and repayment of aigs obligations as they come due future cash requirements the following table shows the maturing debt of aig and its subsidiaries for the next four quarters data table removed a international lease finance corporation b american general finance inc in addition at april 29 2009 aig affiliates had 12 3 billion of commercial paper outstanding under the cpff including 4 9 billion issued by aig funding inc aig funding with the majority of maturities in july 2009 if aigs short term ratings are downgraded aig funding may lose access to the cpff and would be required to find other sources to fund the maturing commercial paper aig expects to meet these obligations primarily through borrowings from the frbny facility and the cash flows including from dispositions of assets supporting these obligations debt maturities for the matched investment program mip are expected to be funded through cash flows generated by the sale or financing of the asset portfolios in the program approximately 3 4 billion of aigfps debt maturities through march 31 2010 are fully collateralized with assets backing the corresponding liabilities it is expected that american general finance inc agf and international lease finance corporation ilfc will require support from aig in addition to their cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales and securitizations to meet their existing obligations aig intends to provide such support through may 15 2010 in the first three months of 2009 aig made capital contributions of 1 25 billion to certain of its domestic life insurance and retirement services companies if a substantial portion of the domestic life insurance and retirement services bond portfolio diminishes significantly in value or suffers credit events aig may need to provide additional capital support for these operations in addition aig made capital contributions of 641 million to its domestic general insurance companies in the first three months of 2009 aig does not anticipate making additional capital contributions to the domestic general insurance companies aig has developed certain plans described below some of which have already been implemented to provide stability to its businesses and to provide for the timely repayment of the frbny facility other plans are still being formulated asset disposition plan since october 2008 when aig originally announced a restructuring plan under which aigs life insurance and retirement services operations and certain other businesses would be divested in whole or in part aig has sold certain businesses and assets and has entered into contracts to sell others however global market conditions have continued to deteriorate posing risks to aigs ability to divest assets at acceptable values as announced on march 2 2009 aigs restructuring plan has evolved in response to these market conditions specifically aigs 74 american international group inc and subsidiaries current plans involve transactions between aig and the frbny with respect to aia and alico additionally aig announced its plans to create an independent entity by transferring aigs u s property and casualty and foreign general insurance businesses into a special purpose vehicle in preparation for the potential sale of a minority stake aig believes that these current plans are necessary to maximize the value of its businesses over a longer time frame therefore some businesses that have previously been prepared for sale will be divested some will be held for later divestiture and some businesses will be prepared for potential offerings to the public dispositions of certain businesses will be subject to regulatory approval proceeds from these dispositions to the extent they do not represent required capital of aigs insurance company subsidiaries are contractually required to be applied toward the repayment of the frbny facility as mandatory prepayments in connection with aigs asset disposition plan through april 30 2009 aig had sold or entered into contracts to sell the following operations on november 26 2008 aig closed the sale of its 50 percent stake in the brazilian joint venture unibanco aig

investments pjsc on april 16 2009 aig entered into a contract to sell 21st century insurance group to farmers group inc this sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2009 on april 24 2009 aig closed the sale of deutsche versicherungs und rckversicherungs aktiengesellschaft darag a german general insurance subsidiary of aig subsidiary wrttembergische und badische versicherungs ag wba in germany to augur these nine operations had total assets and liabilities with carrying values of approximately 19 7 billion and 15 9 billion respectively at march 31 2009 aggregate total proceeds from the sale of these nine businesses including proceeds applied to repay intercompany loan facilities are expected to be 4 6 billion these nine transactions are expected to generate 2 2 billion of net cash proceeds aig expects to divest its institutional asset management businesses consisting of investment services that are offered to external clients these businesses offered for sale exclude those providing traditional fixed income and shorter duration asset and liability management for aigs insurance company subsidiaries as well as proprietary real estate and private equity investments and the mip the separation of these asset management businesses will require the establishment of shared service arrangements between the remaining asset management businesses and those that are sold as well as the establishment of new asset management contracts which will be determined in conjunction with the buyers of these businesses aig expects to continue relationships with the divested businesses for other investment management services used by certain aig subsidiaries aigfp is engaged in a multi step process of unwinding its businesses and portfolios in connection with that process certain assets have been sold or are under contract to be sold the proceeds from these sales will be used to fund aigfps wind down and are not included in the amounts above the frbny has waived the requirement under the frbny credit agreement that the proceeds of these specific pending sales be applied as a mandatory 75 american international group inc and subsidiaries prepayment under the frbny facility which would result in a permanent reduction of the frbnys commitment to lend to aig instead the frbny has given aigfp permission to retain the proceeds of these completed sales and has required that such proceeds received from certain future sales be used to voluntarily prepay the frbny facility with the amounts prepaid available for future reborrowing subject to the terms of the frbny facility with the consent of the frbny aigfp is also opportunistically terminating contracts aigfp is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio reduce risk and hedge the currency interest rate and other market risks associated with aigs affiliated businesses due to the long term duration of aigfps derivative contracts and the complexity of aigfps portfolio aig expects that an orderly wind down of aigfp will take a substantial period of time the cost of executing the wind down will depend on many factors many of which are not within aigs control including market conditions aigfps access to markets via market counterparties the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades aig continually evaluates overall market conditions performance of businesses that are for sale and market and business performance of competitors and likely bidders for their assets this evaluation informs decision making about the timing and process of putting businesses up for sale depending on market and business conditions as noted above aig can modify its sales approach to maximize value for aig and the u s taxpayers in the disposition process such a modification could result in the sale of additional or other assets liquidity of parent and subsidiaries aig parent company at april 29 2009 aig parent had the following sources of liquidity data table removed as a result aig believes that it has sufficient liquidity at the parent level to meet its obligations through at least the next twelve months however no assurance can be given that aigs cash needs will not exceed projected amounts additional collateral calls at aigfp a further downgrade of aigs credit ratings or unexpected capital or liquidity needs of aigs subsidiaries may result in significant additional cash needs for a further discussion of this risk see item 1a risk factors in the 2008 annual report on form 10 k since the fourth quarter of 2008 aig has not had access to its traditional sources of long term or short term financing through the public debt markets further in light of aigs current common stock price aig does not expect to be able to issue equity securities in the public markets in the foreseeable future historically aig depended on dividends distributions and other payments from subsidiaries to fund payments on its obligations in light of aigs current financial situation many of its regulated subsidiaries are restricted from making dividend payments or advancing funds to aig see item 1a risk factors in the 2008 annual report on form 10 k as a result aig has been dependent on the frbny facility the cpff and other transactions with the frbny and the department of the treasury as its primary sources of liquidity primary uses of cash flow are for debt service and subsidiary funding in the three month period ended march 31 2009 aig parent collected 281 million in dividends and other payments from subsidiaries primarily from insurance company subsidiaries and retired 381 million of debt excluding mip and series aigfp debt excluding mip and series aigfp debt aig parent made interest payments totaling 366 million and made 2 51 billion in net capital contributions to subsidiaries aig parent funds a portion of its short term working capital needs through commercial paper issued by aig funding since october 2008 all commercial paper issuance for aig funding has been through the cpff program as of march 31 2009 aig funding had 5 5 billion of commercial paper outstanding with an average maturity of 27 days of which 14 million were non cpff borrowings 76 american international group inc and subsidiaries aigs liquidity could also be further impaired by unforeseen significant outflows of cash this situation may arise due to circumstances that aig may be unable to control such as a further reduction in asset values a worsening of the current recession or the requirements of subsidiaries to replace capital as a consequence of catastrophe claims regulatory and other legal restrictions would likely limit aigs ability to transfer funds freely either to or from its subsidiaries aigs long term unsecured debt and equity units have been trading at levels significantly below their face value aig continuously evaluates the possibility of repurchasing its long term unsecured debt and equity units and may engage with the consent of the frbny and the department of the treasury in public or privately negotiated debt or equity unit repurchases in the future general insurance aig currently expects that its general insurance subsidiaries will be able to continue to meet their obligations as they come due through cash from operations and to the extent necessary asset dispositions one or more large catastrophes however may require aig to provide additional support to the affected general insurance operations in addition further downgrades in aigs credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of these subsidiaries a downgrade in the insurer financial strength ratings of an insurance company subsidiary could result in non renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect these companies ability to meet their own obligations and require that aig provide capital or liquidity support to them for a discussion of aigs potential inability to support its subsidiaries see item 1a risk factors liquidity in the 2008 annual report on form 10 k at march 31 2009 general insurance had liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments of 12 1 billion these are consolidated cash and short term investments for a number of legal entities within general insurance generally these assets are not transferable across various legal entities however there are generally sufficient cash and short term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs in the event additional liquidity is required management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities government and corporate bonds represented 96 3 percent of general insurance total fixed income investments at march 31 2009 given the size and liquidity profile of aigs general insurance investment portfolios aig believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk aigs asset liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and the specific nature and risk profile of liabilities historically there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of aigs general insurance investments and the payment of claims life insurance and retirement services at march 31 2009 life insurance and retirement services had liquidity in the form of cash and short term investments of 33 4 billion these are consolidated cash and short term investments for a number of legal entities within life insurance and retirement services generally these assets are not transferable across various legal entities however there are generally sufficient cash and short term investments within those legal entities such that they can meet their individual liquidity needs in the event additional liquidity is required management believes it can provide such liquidity through sale of a portion of its substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds as well as equity securities government and corporate bonds represented 85 6 percent of life insurance and retirement services total fixed income investments at march 31 2009 given the size and liquidity profile of aigs life insurance and retirement services investment portfolios aig believes that deviations from its projected claim experience do not constitute a significant liquidity risk the life insurance and retirement services subsidiaries have been able to meet liquidity needs even during the period of higher surrenders which was experienced from mid september 2008 through march 31 2009 and expect to be able to do so in the foreseeable future however due to the significant decline in the value of the bond portfolio of the life insurance and retirement services subsidiaries aig has provided capital to support to these operations a significant increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals which could be triggered by a variety of factors including aig specific concerns could result in a substantial liquidity strain other potential events causing a liquidity strain could include economic 77 american international group inc and subsidiaries collapse of a nation or region significant to life insurance and retirement services operations nationalization catastrophic terrorist acts pandemics or other economic or political upheaval foreign life insurance companies aigs foreign life insurance companies including alico had significant capital needs following publicity of aig parents liquidity issues related credit ratings downgrades and the decline in the equity markets during the three months ended march 31 2009 aig provided funding of 300 million to the foreign life insurance companies aig believes that its foreign life insurance subsidiaries have adequate capital to support their business plans through 2009 however to the extent the investment portfolios of the foreign life insurance companies continue to be adversely affected by market conditions aig may need to lend or contribute additional capital to these companies for a discussion of aigs potential inability to support its subsidiaries see item 1a risk factors liquidity in the 2008 annual report on form 10 k domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies during the three months ended march 31 2009 aig contributed capital totaling 1 25 billion to certain of its domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services subsidiaries to replace a portion of the capital lost as a result of net realized capital losses primarily resulting from other than temporary impairment charges further capital contributions will be required to maintain desired levels of capital to the extent the investment portfolios of the domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies continue to be adversely affected by market conditions the most significant potential liquidity need of aigs domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies is the funding of surrenders a substantial increase in surrender activity could place stress on the liquidity of these companies and require asset sales or contributions from aig at the current rate of surrenders aig believes that its domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies will have sufficient resources to meet these obligations however aig may need to inject additional capital to offset statutory other than temporary impairment charges for the domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services companies for a discussion of aigs potential inability to support its subsidiaries see item 1a risk factors liquidity in the 2008 annual report on form 10 k financial services aigs major financial services operating subsidiaries consist of ilfc aigfp agf and aig consumer finance group inc aigcfg traditional sources of funds considered in meeting the liquidity needs of these operations are generally no longer available these sources included issuances of guaranteed investment agreements gias issuance of long and short term debt issuance of commercial paper bank loans and bank credit facilities however ilfc has been able to finance airbus aircraft purchases under its 2004 export credit agency eca facility and aigcfg has been able to retain a significant portion of customer deposits providing a measure of liquidity ilfc prior to september 2008 ilfcs traditional sources of liquidity had been collections of aircraft lease payments borrowing in the public debt markets and under its 1999 and 2004 eca facilities to fund aircraft purchases and to satisfy maturing debt proceeds of aircraft sales and income from third parties for fleet management services during the first quarter of 2009 ilfc was unable to borrow in the public debt markets and due to downgrades in its short term credit rating lost access to the cpff and therefore borrowed 1 7 billion from aig funding to repay its maturing debt and other contractual obligations ilfc is pursuing secured financings from banks and manufacturers ilfc has the capacity under its present facilities and indentures to enter into secured financing of approximately 5 0 billion or more through subsidiaries that qualify as non restricted subsidiaries under ilfcs 78 american international group inc and subsidiaries indentures subject to the receipt of any required consents under the frbny facility and under its bank facilities and terms loans if ilfc does not receive sufficient secured financing aig expects that ilfcs current borrowings and future cash flows from operations which may include aircraft sales will be inadequate to permit ilfc to meet its existing obligations therefore aig intends to provide support to ilfc through may 15 2010 as a result of moodys downgrade of ilfcs long term debt rating to baa2 on march 17 2009 ilfc needs written consent from the security trustee of its 2004 eca facility before it can fund airbus purchases under the facility ilfc financed eight aircraft under the facility during the first quarter of 2009 two of which required written consent which was obtained ilfcs current credit ratings also require segregation of security deposits and maintenance reserves related to aircraft funded under both its 1999 and 2004 eca facilities into separate accounts at march 31 2009 ilfc had segregated approximately 265 million of deposits and maintenance reserves the amount of funds segregated fluctuates with changes in the related deposits maintenance reserves and debt maturities further downgrades would impose additional restrictions under the 1999 and 2004 eca facilities including the requirement to segregate rental payments and to receive prior consent to withdraw funds from the segregated accounts aigfp prior to september 2008 aigfp had historically funded its operations through the issuance of notes and bonds gia borrowings other structured financing transactions and repurchase agreements in the second half of 2008 aigfps access to its traditional sources of liquidity was significantly reduced and it relied on aig parent to meet most of its liquidity needs aigfps asset backed commercial paper conduit curzon funding llc was accepted into the cpff with a total borrowing limit of 7 2 billion and had approximately 6 3 billion outstanding at april 29 2009 separately a structured investment vehicle sponsored but not consolidated by aigfp nightingale finance llc was also accepted into the cpff with a borrowing limit of 1 1 billion as of april 29 2009 this vehicle had issued approximately 1 1 billion under the cpff the following table presents a roll forward of the amount of collateral posted by aigfp data table removed agf prior to september 2008 agfs traditional source of liquidity has been collections of customer receivables and borrowings in the public markets agf anticipates that going forward its primary source of funds to support its operations and repay its obligations will be customer receivable collections in order to improve cash flow from operations agf has significantly limited its lending activities and aggressively managed its expenses in addition agf is considering potential sales or securitization of its finance receivables aig intends to provide support to agf through may 15 2010 with aigs continued support aig believes that agf will have adequate funds to meet its debt and other obligations payable during the next twelve months aigcfg aig believes that the funding needs of aigcfg have stabilized but it is possible that renewed customer and counterparty concerns could substantially increase aigcfgs liquidity needs in 2009 through april 15 2009 aig has completed the sale of certain aigcfg businesses in taiwan thailand and the philippines 79 american international group inc and subsidiaries asset management asset managements principal cash requirements are to fund general working capital needs investment commitments related to proprietary investments in private equity and real estate as well as any liquidity mismatches in the spread based investment business cash requirements related to institutional asset management are funded through general operating cash flows from management and performance fees proceeds from events in underlying funds capital calls to third parties sale of portfolio companies etc as well as intercompany funding provided by aig consequently institutional asset managements ability to fund certain of its needs may depend on advances from aig under various intercompany borrowing facilities restrictions on these facilities would have adverse consequences on the ability of the business to satisfy its obligations with respect to the global real estate business investing activities are also funded through third party financing arrangements which are secured by the relevant properties the guaranteed investment contract gic and mip programs are in run off aig expects to fund its obligations under these programs through cash flows generated from invested assets principal and interest as well as sales of investments primarily fixed maturity securities however market illiquidity and diminished values within the investment portfolios may impair aigs ability to sell the related program assets or sell such assets for a price adequate to settle the corresponding liabilities when they come due in such a case aig parent

almost all of aigs businesses were adversely affected in the first quarter of 2009 by the criticism and negative publicity that surrounded the payment of retention awards to employees of aigfp for a discussion of the effect that continued or renewed criticism or additional negative publicity may have on aig see item 1a risk factors in part ii of this quarterly report on form 10 q general insurance although commercial insurance has been generally successful in retaining clients some have reduced the number of lines or limits of coverage due in part to concerns over aigs financial strength in addition the number of new business opportunities has declined since september 2008 and the negative publicity concerning aig has made soliciting new business more difficult senior management has spent considerable time since september 2008 meeting with policyholders and brokers explaining the financial strength of commercial insurance and the protections afforded policyholders by insurance regulations nevertheless net premiums written declined 18 percent in the three month period ended march 31 2009 compared to the same period of 2008 the retention of existing business continues to be moderately lower than in the comparable prior year period however retention levels have shown improvement since the end of the first quarter of 2009 overall rates in commercial insurance were essentially flat in early 2009 compared to the first quarter of 2008 the stabilization of rates is an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2008 and reflects the offsetting effects of downward pressure on premiums from the current recessionary environment and the recent introduction of new competitors in the marketplace and the upward pressure on premiums from the combination of investment and underwriting losses suffered by the commercial insurance industry aig expects that the current recessionary environment will continue to affect united guaranty corporations ugc operating results for the foreseeable future and will result in a significant operating loss for ugc in 2009 for second quarter 2009 foreign general insurance expects to be able to maintain solid client retention rates and underwriting results however de risking by some customers and the economic downturn will continue to adversely affect foreign generals net premiums written primarily through a decline in new business production conversely foreign general should also benefit from the trend of customers de risking from other providers in the far east operations where april is the critical renewal period the second quarter production is consistent with the first months of this year which was affected by the major deterioration in auto sales coupled with reduction in leisure travel although foreign general continues to face challenges in commercial lines particularly in the u k ireland and europe regions due to increased competition and worldwide credit related insurance exposures its traditional capabilities of servicing its customers innovation and claims paying ability continue to attract new accounts foreign general remains committed to underwriting for profit and continues to examine all risk rating coverage adequacy and rate improvement particularly in the financial institutions sector on march 2 2009 aig announced that it intends to form a general insurance holding company including its commercial insurance group foreign general unit and other property and casualty operations aiu holdings with a board of directors management team and brand distinct from aig the establishment of this holding company will assist aig in preparing for the potential sale of a minority stake in this business on april 21 2009 aig announced that it will transfer this business to an spv in return for preferred and common interests in the spv aig also intends to purchase from aiu holdings its equity interests in ilfc ugc and transatlantic holdings inc transatlantic to clarify the businesses of aiu holdings life insurance and retirement services aig expects that criticism and negative publicity about aig during the first quarter of 2009 and aigs previously announced asset disposition plan will continue to adversely affect life insurance and retirement services operating results in 2009 specifically net investment income deferred policy acquisition costs and sales inducement asset sia amortization and net realized capital gains losses in addition aigs issues have affected certain operations through higher surrender activity primarily in the u s domestic retirement fixed annuity business and 89 american international group inc and subsidiaries foreign investment oriented and retirement products while surrender levels have declined from their peaks in mid september of 2008 they continue to be higher than historic levels in certain products and countries and aig expects surrender activity to continue to be volatile these uncertainties together with rating agency downgrades have resulted in significantly reduced levels of new sales activity particularly among products and markets where ratings are critical sales of investment oriented and retirement services products have also declined due to the general decline in the equity markets new sales activity is expected to remain at lower levels until the uncertainties relating to aig are resolved on march 2 2009 aig and the board of governors of the federal reserve system announced their intent to enter into transactions pursuant to which aig will transfer to the frbny preferred equity interests in newly formed spvs each spv will hold directly or indirectly 100 percent of the common stock of aia in one case and alico in the other in exchange for the preferred equity

plan for addressing each book including each books risks risk mitigation options monitoring metrics and certain implications of various potential outcomes each plan has been reviewed by a steering committee whose membership includes senior executives of aig the plans are subject to change as efforts progress and as conditions in the financial markets evolve and they contemplate depending on the book in question alternative strategies including sales assignments or other transfers of positions terminations of positions and or run offs of positions in accordance with existing terms execution of the plans is overseen by a transaction approval process involving increasingly senior members of aigfps and aigs respective management groups as specific actions entail greater liquidity and financial consequences successful execution of the plans is subject to varying degrees depending on the transactions of a given book to market conditions and in many circumstances counterparty negotiation and agreement as a consequence of its wind down strategy aigfp is entering into new derivative transactions only to hedge its current portfolio reduce risk and hedge the currency interest rate and other market risks associated with its affiliated businesses aigfp has already reduced the size of certain portions of its portfolio including effecting a substantial reduction in credit derivative transactions in respect of multi sector cdos in connection with the maiden lane iii llc ml iii transaction a sale of its commodity index business termination of its activities as a foreign exchange prime broker and sale and other disposition of the large majority of its energy infrastructure investment portfolio due to the long term duration of many of aigfps derivative contracts and to the complexity of aigfps portfolio aig expects that an orderly wind down will take a substantial period of time the cost of executing the wind down will depend on many factors many of which are not within aigfps control including market conditions aigfps access to markets via market counterparties the availability of liquidity and the potential implications of further rating downgrades asset management distressed global markets have caused a significant decline in the value of assets under management translating to lower base management fees and reduced carried interest revenues for asset management operations tight credit markets have put pressure on the commercial and residential real estate markets which has caused values in certain geographic locations to decline resulting in impairment charges on real estate held for investment purposes these market conditions have also adversely affected the ability to pay or refinance maturing debt obligations in the private equity and real estate portfolios the criticism and negative publicity about aig following the events of september 2008 and challenging market conditions have contributed to the loss of institutional and retail clients as well as significant redemptions 90 american international group inc and subsidiaries from certain of aigs managed hedge and mutual funds client losses and redemptions have leveled off from

lien business ceased insuring second lien business as of september 30 2008 and during the fourth quarter of 2008 ceased insuring new private student loan business and suspended insuring new business throughout its european operations all of these actions were in response to the worsening conditions in the global housing markets and resulted in a significant decline in new business written during

businesses net premiums written declined 6 percent and 29 percent respectively primarily due to tightening market conditions and underwriting standards in the first lien business and the decision to suspend insuring new business throughout europe in the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition new insurance written which is a measure of the amount of new insurance added to the portfolio decreased 80 percent and 83 percent for first lien and international business respectively in the three month period ended march 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 claims and claims adjustment expenses

included all mortgage insurance risks in a single premium deficiency test because the manner of acquiring servicing and measuring the profitability of all mortgage guaranty contracts was consistent with the decision in 2008 to place the second lien business in run off management no longer measures the profitability of the second lien business in the same way as ugcs ongoing businesses and no longer reports loss ratio or expense ratio information for the second lien business as a result ugc performs a separate premium deficiency calculation for the second lien business at march 31 2009 the present value of expected second lien future premiums of 518 million and the already established liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense of 804 million exceeded the present value of expected second lien future loss and expense payments net of expected future recoveries of 1 3 billion resulting in the release of the premium deficiency reserve of 222 million the second lien risk in force at march 31 2009 totaled 2 9 billion compared to 3 7 billion of risk in force at march 31 2008 the second lien business is expected to run off over the next 10 to 12 years risk in force represents the full amount of second lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool ugc may record net losses on this business in future periods because the timing of future delinquencies may precede recognition of future premiums ugcs domestic mortgage risk in force totaled 30 0 billion as of march 31 2009 and the 60 day delinquency ratio was 8 6 percent based on number of policies consistent with mortgage industry practice compared to domestic mortgage risk in force of 31 5 billion

and claims adjustment expense the following table presents the components of the general insurance gross liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense loss reserves by major lines of business on a statutory annual statement basis data table removed presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners aigs gross liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense represents the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including estimates for incurred but not yet reported reserves ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments resulting therefrom are currently reflected in operating income because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development estimates for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on notices of mortgage loan delinquencies and estimates of delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers based upon historical reporting trends mortgage guaranty establishes reserves using a percentage of the contractual liability for each delinquent loan reported that is based upon past experience regarding certain loan factors such as age of the delinquency cure rates dollar amount of the loan and type of mortgage loan because mortgage delinquencies and claims payments are affected primarily by macroeconomic events such as changes in home price appreciation or depreciation interest rates and unemployment the determination of the ultimate loss cost requires a high degree of judgment aig believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans consistent with industry practice aig does not establish a reserve for insured loans that are not currently delinquent but that may become delinquent in future periods at march 31 2009 general insurance net loss reserves decreased 201 million from the prior year end to 72 25 billion the net loss reserves represent loss reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable net

decennial mortality table the non tabular workers compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in new york and pennsylvania and follows the statutory regulations for each state for new york companies the discount is based on a five percent interest rate and the companies own payout patterns for pennsylvania companies the statute has specified discount factors for accident years 2001 and prior which are based on a six percent interest rate and an industry payout pattern for accident years 2002 and subsequent the discount is based on the payout patterns and investment yields of the companies certain other liability occurrence and products liability occurrence business in american international reinsurance company limited airco that was written by

believes that the general insurance net loss reserves are adequate to cover general insurance net losses and loss expenses as of march 31 2009 while aig regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of march 31 2009 in the opinion of management such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated financial condition although it could have a material adverse effect on aigs

table removed the following tables summarize development favorable or unfavorable of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years other than accretion of discount data table removed data table removed in determining the quarterly loss development from prior accident years aig conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each profit center for example if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years the actuaries examine the indicated effect 104 american international group inc and subsidiaries such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center as appropriate in the three month period ended march 31 2009 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the three month period ended march 31 2009 as part of its reserving process aig also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues such as those related to the u s mortgage and housing market 2009 net loss development in the three month period ended march 31 2009 net loss development from prior accident years was adverse by approximately 64 million excluding approximately 98 million from accretion of loss reserve discount the overall adverse development of 64 million

commercial insurance prior accident year development is approximately 100 million of favorable development relating to loss sensitive business written by the risk management group however this favorable development is offset by a corresponding reduction in net premiums earned and thus did not affect underwriting loss in the first quarter of 2009 mortgage guaranty reserves from prior

million which included approximately 76 million of adverse development from mortgage 105 american international group inc and subsidiaries guaranty and 18 million of adverse development from personal lines offset by favorable development from most classes of business in commercial insurance and from transatlantic asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2008 annual report on form 10 k aigs reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground up analysis in the three month period ended march 31 2009 a minor amount of adverse incurred loss development pertaining to asbestos was reflected in the table that follows this development was primarily attributable to several large defendants a summary of reserve activity including estimates for applicable ibnr relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined appears in the table below the vast majority of such claims arise from policies written in 1984 and prior years the current environmental policies that aig underwrites on a claims made basis have been excluded from the table below data table removed all amounts pertain to policies underwritten in prior years primarily to policies issued in 1984 and prior years 106 american international group inc and subsidiaries the gross and net ibnr included in the liability for

claims count activity was as follows data table removed survival ratios asbestos and environmental the following table presents aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at march 31 2009 and 2008 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the march 31 2009 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at march 31 2008 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments in addition aigs survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable settlements during 2008 and 2007 these settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at march 31 2009 by approximately 1 1 years and 2 3 years respectively and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at march 31 2008 by approximately 1 6 years and 3 2 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aigs determination of its reserves is not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio 107 american international group inc and subsidiaries aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based

0 billion for the same period in 2008 the decrease in the unrealized market valuation loss on this portfolio was largely due to the substantial decline in outstanding net notional amount resulting

of 2009 with respect to cds transactions in the corporate arbitrage portfolio compared to an unrealized market valuation loss of 896 million for the same period in 2008 during the first quarter of

122 american international group inc and subsidiaries asset management results asset management results were as follows data table removed asset management recognized lower operating losses in the three month period ended march 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to higher foreign exchange gains on gic liabilities net gains on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting and the positive effect of tightening corporate credit spreads on credit default swap investments offsetting these improvements were lower partnership income higher equity losses due to impairments on real estate investments lower unrealized net carried interest revenues and an allowance for credit losses recognized on loan investments held by the mip other than temporary impairments for the spread based investment business increased marginally as increases in the mip were offset by decreases in the gic restructuring related expenses during the three months ended march 31 2009 for the asset management segment were 15 million the 633 million operating loss in the three month period ended march 31 2009 includes approximately 600 million in net operating losses related to businesses which are expected to be retained by aig including the mip and proprietary real estate and private equity investment strategies spread based investment business results the spread based investment business reported significantly lower operating losses in the three month period ended march 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to significantly lower net realized capital losses accretion income on investments held in the mip of 49 million and lower funding costs in the gic business these improvements were partially offset by a decline in income from partnership investments held in the gic which decreased 185 million in the three month period ended march 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 due to weaker market conditions in 2009 net realized capital losses composed primarily of other than temporary impairments on fixed income securities were 405 million in the three month period ended march 31 2009 compared to 1 3 billion in the same period in 2008 the decrease in net realized capital losses for the three month period ended march 31 2009 primarily consists of an increase of approximately 615 million in net foreign exchange gains on foreign denominated gic reserves and mip liabilities fair value gains of 154 million on credit default swap investments held by the mip due to the tightening of corporate credit spreads and fair value gains on interest rate and foreign exchange hedges not qualifying for hedge accounting treatments for both the gic and mip of 401 million these increases were partially offset by an increased allowance for credit loss recorded on bank loan and commercial mortgage investments of the mip and lower gains on the sales of securities aig enters into derivative arrangements to hedge the effect of changes in currency and interest rates associated with the fixed and floating rate and foreign currency denominated obligations issued under these programs some of 123 american international group inc and subsidiaries these hedging relationships do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore creates volatility in operating results despite being effective economic hedges the other than temporary impairment charges on fixed maturity securities held in the gic declined during the three month period ended march 31 2009 due to the reduction in assets resulting from the termination of the u s securities lending program in december 2008 the other than temporary impairment charges on fixed maturity securities held in the mip increased during the three month period ended march 31 2009 primarily due to credit losses and severity write downs on structured fixed income investments the decline in impairments in the gic was largely offset by the increased impairments in the mip see

private equity and hedge funds but the mip does not institutional asset management results institutional asset management recognized an increased operating loss in the three month period ended march 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily resulting from impairments on proprietary real estate investments and losses on equity investments in real estate joint ventures of 292 million due to significant dislocation in the real estate markets in which properties are held lower unrealized carried interest revenues of 108 million reflecting declines in portfolio asset valuations primarily in private equity lower base management fees from external clients of 41 million due to lower average assets under management 53 million of operating losses on consolidated private equity

reflects lower asset values due to the significant deterioration in the credit and equity markets during 2008 as well as the effect of net client outflows 124 american international group inc and subsidiaries brokerage services and mutual funds revenues and operating income related to brokerage services and mutual fund activities decreased in the three month period ended march 31 2009 from the

for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or aig may not realize a full recovery on its investment regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the

annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred aig performed goodwill impairment tests at march 31 2009 the impairment assessment involves a two step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and if potential impairment is present the amount of impairment is measured and recorded impairment is tested at the reporting unit level or when all reporting units that comprise an operating segment have similar economic characteristics impairment is tested at the operating segment level management initially assesses the potential for impairment by estimating the fair value of each of aigs reporting units or operating segments and comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying amounts of those reporting units including allocated goodwill the estimate of a reporting units fair value may be based on one or a combination of approaches including market based earning multiples of the units peer companies discounted expected future cash flows external appraisals or in the case of reporting units being considered for sale third party indications of fair value if available management considers one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test as part of the impairment test management compares the sum of the estimated fair values of aigs reporting units with aigs fully diluted common stock market capitalization as a basis for concluding on the reasonableness of the estimated reporting unit fair values if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired the amount of impairment if any is measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the estimated fair value of the goodwill the estimated fair value of the goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts that would be assigned to the reporting units assets and liabilities in a hypothetical business combination an impairment charge is recognized in income to the extent of the excess management observed a narrowing of the fair values over the carrying values of the life insurance and retirement servicesjapan

i e more than 50 percent likely that the asset will be realized realization of aigs net deferred tax asset depends on aigs ability to consummate the proposed aia and alico debt for equity exchanges with the frbny and to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character within carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating and capital losses tax credits and deductible temporary differences were incurred estimates of future taxable income could change in the near term perhaps materially which may require aig to adjust its valuation allowance such adjustment either positive or negative could be material to aigs consolidated financial condition or its results of operations because the realization of the deferred tax asset relies on the completion of the proposed transactions and a projection of future taxable income aig views this as a critical accounting estimate aig is relying upon producing taxable operating profits from the businesses to be retained principally commercial insurance and foreign general insurance aig has evaluated its forecasts of future operating income and determined that there will be sufficient operating income inclusive of gains on the divestiture of businesses to realize the recorded net deferred tax asset when making its assessment about the realization of its deferred tax assets at march

policyholder contract deposits securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased certain trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors certain long term debt and certain hybrid financial instruments included in other liabilities the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing able and knowledgeable market participants at the measurement date the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value conversely financial instruments traded in other than active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment an active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis an other than active market is one in which there are few transactions the prices are not current price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers or in which little information is released publicly for the asset or liability being valued pricing observability is affected by a number 129 american international group inc and subsidiaries of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions aig management is responsible for the determination of the value of the financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions with respect to securities aig employs independent third party valuation service providers to gather analyze and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments when aigs valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote which is generally non binding or by employing widely accepted internal valuation models valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and through the use of widely accepted internal valuation models provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of service agreements the inputs used by the valuation service providers include but are not limited to market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities interest rate yield curves credit spreads currency rates and other market observable information as applicable the valuation models take into account among other things market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term interest rate credit rating industry sector and when applicable collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information when market transactions or other market observable data is limited the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased aig employs specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair values of aigs financial assets and financial liabilities aigs processes are designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value aig assesses the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers through various analytical techniques in addition aig may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from aigs valuation service providers to other third party valuation sources for selected securities aig also validates prices for selected securities obtained from brokers through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions the fair value of fixed income and equity

regulatory capital cds transactions will terminate within the next 12 months the vast majority of transactions with aigfp during the transition period of the revised framework for the international convergence of capital standards issued by the basel committee on banking supervision aigfp has not been required to make any payments as part of terminations initiated by counterparties during the first quarter of 2009 aigfp reclassified one regulatory capital cds transaction from regulatory capital corporate loans to regulatory capital other given the higher likelihood that it will not be terminated when the regulatory capital benefit expires for the counterparty aig does not believe that at this time the cds provides significant risk transfer benefit to the counterparty however aigfp will continue to monitor this transaction closely during april 2009 aigfp effected the early termination of a cds transaction written on a european rmbs security that was reported as part of regulatory capital other at march 31 2009 at a level approximating its fair value at that time given its unique structure and concentrated exposure to high loan to value spanish residential mortgages this transaction had exposed aigfp to a relatively higher level of liquidity and credit risk than any other regulatory capital cds exposure and aig felt it prudent to terminate the transaction to avoid further deterioration in light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data to the extent deemed relevant and available aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the quarter ended march 31 2009 other than for transactions where aigfp believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief aig will continue to assess the valuation of this portfolio and monitor developments in the marketplace given the significant deterioration in the credit markets and the risk that aigfps expectations with respect to the termination of these transactions by its counterparties may not materialize there can be no assurance that aig will not recognize unrealized market valuation losses from this portfolio in future periods and given its size recognition 134 american international group inc and subsidiaries of even a small percentage

group inc and subsidiaries collateral most of aigfps credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes although aigfp has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi sector cdos regulatory capital relief transactions as of march 31 2009 73 5 percent of aigfps regulatory capital relief transactions measured by net notional amount were subject to a credit support annex csa in other transactions which represent 1 0 percent of the total net notional amount of the outstanding regulatory capital relief transactions aigfp is obligated to put a csa or alternative collateral arrangement in place if aigs ratings fall below certain levels typically a a3 at march 31 2009 25 5 percent of the regulatory capital relief portfolio is not subject to collateral posting provisions in general each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand alone master agreement or similar agreement under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction the underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies from one counterparty to another and there is no standard formula the varied mechanisms resulted from varied negotiations with different counterparties the following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio reference to market indices under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index such as either itraxx or cdx this mechanism is used for cds transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages while the market index is not a direct proxy it has the advantage of being readily obtainable market value of reference obligation under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the difference between the net notional amount of a referenced rmbs security and the securitys market value expected loss models under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on the amount of expected credit losses generally determined using a rating agency model negotiated amount under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between aigfp and the counterparty which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by aigfp the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio prior to consideration of transactions other than aigfps super senior credit default swaps subject to the same master agreements were as follows there were no collateral postings on this portfolio prior to march 31 2008 data table removed collateral calls aigfp has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps of which a large majority relate to multi sector cdos to a lesser extent aigfp has also received collateral calls in 143 american international group inc and subsidiaries respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage the amount of collateral postings with respect to aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions were as follows data table removed the amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of aigs credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor while a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined given the severe market disruption lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption aigfp is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it would be required to post in the future valuation sensitivity arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aigs calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average for any quarterly period during the past year prices for cdos declined between 6 14 percent and 11 93 percent of the notional amount outstanding further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current dislocated market conditions for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the total 12 0 billion net notional amount of cds written on multi sector cdos outstanding at march 31 2009 a bet value is available for 8 4 billion net notional amount no bet value is determined for 3 6 billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 8 4 billion as mentioned above the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities given their significantly depressed valuations given the current difficult market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo at this time 144 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents key inputs used in the bet model and the potential increase decrease to the fair value of the derivative liability by abs category at march 31 2009 corresponding to changes in these key inputs data table removed a the diversity score is an input at the cdo level a calculation of sensitivity to this input by type of security is not possible b the discount curve is an input at the cdo

a series of data points these results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption no assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed perhaps significantly the ranges assumed by aig for purposes of the above analysis no assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these key inputs can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above corporate debt the following table represents the relevant market credit indices and cds maturity used to estimate the

model for each of the businesses general insurance life insurance retirement services and asset managements spread based investment business the primary objectives are liquidity preservation of capital growth of surplus and generation of investment income to support the insurance products difficult market conditions in recent quarters have significantly hindered aigs ability to achieve these objectives and these challenges are expected to persist for the foreseeable future at the local operating unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at aig consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities in the case of life insurance and retirement services companies as well as in the gic and mip portfolios of the asset management segment the fundamental investment strategy is to match as nearly as is practicable the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in commercial insurance historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in light of aigs recent net operating losses aig changed its intent to hold to maturity certain tax exempt municipal securities held by its insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities held by foreign general insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities 147 american international group inc and subsidiaries the market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components including interest rate environment credit spread embedded optionality such as call features liquidity structural complexity foreign exchange risk and other credit and non credit factors however in most circumstances pricing is most sensitive to interest rates such that the market price declines as interest rates rise and increases as interest rates fall this effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities aig records at fair value the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies pursuant to fas 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and related accounting pronouncements however with limited exceptions primarily with respect to separate account products consolidated on aigs balance sheet pursuant to sop 03 01 aig does not adjust the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities and falling interest rates have the opposite effect this results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains losses on securities in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative inverse changes in gains losses on aigs liabilities because aigs asset duration in certain low yield currencies particularly japan and taiwan is shorter than its liability duration aig views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous notwithstanding

reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale aig evaluates its investments for impairments in valuation as well as credit the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer its near term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances see critical accounting estimates other than temporary impairments herein for further information after a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired the amount of such impairment is determined by reference to that securitys contemporaneous fair value and recorded as a charge to earnings 155 american international

backed and collateral securities securities of financial institutions and other equity securities notwithstanding aigs intent and ability to hold such securities until they have recovered their cost basis and despite structures that indicate that a substantial amount of the securities should continue to perform in accordance with original terms aig concluded that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment would be temporary pricing of cmbs has been adversely affected by market perceptions that underlying mortgage defaults will increase as a result aig recognized 55 million of other than temporary impairment charges in the three month periods ended march 31 2009 on cmbs valued at a severe discount to cost despite the absence of any meaningful deterioration in performance of the underlying credits because aig concluded that it could not reasonably assert that the impairment period was temporary aig recognized 97 million in other than temporary impairment charges due to issuer specific credit events certain high quality highly rated securities in the cmbs portfolio experienced severe market price declines in late 2008 and to date in 2009 with respect to this portfolio aig has performed extensive internal fundamental credit risk analysis on a security by security basis including consideration of credit enhancements and expected defaults on underlying collateral in managements view this internal analysis supplemented by relevant industry analyst reports and forecasts and other market available data provides persuasive evidence sufficient to overcome the premise that such severe declines in fair value below amortized cost should be considered other than temporary as a result impairment charges were not taken on certain cmbs having fair values 1 9 billion

unanticipated price declines and associated reduction of liquidity in 2008 exceeded the parameters historically used by aig for purposes of its asset liability and liquidity management processes aig has responded to these developments by enhancing its risk management processes and de risking certain exposures based upon enhanced scenario related stress testing de risking plans have been implemented at both the business units and the corporate level in an effort to minimize the capital and liquidity needs of aigs local legal entities however the continuation of such market turmoil and associated price declines limited liquidity in the markets and a decline in the number of counterparties willing to transact with aig have severely constrained aigs ability to utilize techniques for mitigating its exposure to credit market and liquidity risks aig continues to reassess its risk management control environment and its enterprise risk management functions both in its individual businesses as well as at the corporate level in light of aigs current situation aig continues to invest in risk management systems and processes where those investments are consistent with aigs current liquidity capital and disposition plans 160 american international group inc and subsidiaries credit risk management aig defines its aggregate credit exposures to a counterparty as the sum of its fixed maturities loans finance leases reinsurance recoverables derivatives deposits and letters of credit both in the case of financial institutions and the specified credit equivalent exposure to certain insurance products which embody credit risk the following table presents aigs largest credit exposures as a percentage of total equity data table removed data table removed aig monitors its aggregate cross border exposures by country and regional group of countries aig defines its cross border exposure to include both cross border credit exposures and its cross border investments in its own international subsidiaries nine countries had cross border exposures in excess of 20 percent of total equity at march 31 2009 based on aigs internal risk ratings at that date seven were rated aaa one was rated aa and one was rated a in addition aig reviews and manages its industry concentrations aigs single largest industry credit exposure is to the global financial institutions sector comprised of banks securities firms life and non life insurance companies reinsurance companies finance companies and government sponsored entities the following table presents aigs largest credit exposures to the global financial institution sector as a percentage of total equity data table removed exposure to money center global bank groups as a percentage of total equity was 138 7 percent at

securities can be subject to a higher risk of dividend or interest deferral and principal non payment or non redemption because they provide various levels of capital support to these institutions and may be subject to regulatory and contractual restrictions these securities are held by various aig subsidiaries and are diversified by obligor and country in addition aigs financial institution exposures include other subordinated securities totaling 16 6 billion market risk management aigs market exposures can be categorized as follows benchmark interest rates benchmark interest rates are also known as risk free interest rates and are associated with either the government treasury yield curve or the swap curve the fair value of aigs significant fixed maturity securities portfolio changes as benchmark interest rates change credit spread or risk premium credit spread risk is the potential for loss due to a change in an instruments risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration default free instrument equity and alternative investment prices aigs exposure to equity and alternative investment prices arises from direct investments in common stocks and mutual funds from minimum benefit guarantees embedded in the structure of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance products and from other equity like investments such as partnerships comprised of hedge funds and private equity funds private equity investments commercial real estate and real estate funds foreign currency exchange rates aig is a globally diversified enterprise with significant income assets liabilities and capital denominated in a variety of currencies aig uses a number of measures and approaches to measure and quantify its market risk exposure including data table removed the magnitudes of volatilities of financial markets and degree of correlation among different markets risks and asset classes in 2008 were unprecedented and rendered the var measure that is based on historical data analysis a much less reliable and indicative risk measure as a result aig now uses sensitivities under specific scenarios to convey the magnitude of its exposures to various key market risk factors such as yield curve equity markets and alternative assets and foreign currency exchange rates 162 american international group inc and subsidiaries insurance risk management catastrophe exposures the nature of aigs business exposes it to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year in order to control this exposure aig uses a combination of techniques including setting aggregate limits in key business units monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect aigs operating results other risks such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease like the swine flu influenza a virus h1n1 could adversely affect aigs business and operating results to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance programs pandemic influenza on april 25 2009 the world health organization who stated that new lab studies confirm that the latest outbreak of swine flu is a new strain of a humanly transmissible influenza virus that has the potential to trigger an influenza pandemic on april 29 2009 the who raised its flu alert level to 5 the second highest level which indicates a pandemic is imminent the swine flu virus has the potential to spread rapidly and has already spread from north america to australia and asia if such a pandemic were to take place early quarantine and vaccination could be critical to containment although aig continues to monitor the developing facts current evidence suggests that a resulting pandemic would be of moderate severity with some chance that it could be severe a significant global pandemic could have a material adverse effect on life insurance and retirement services operating results and liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity rates utilizing a scenario based approach and an industry standard model aig has analyzed its insurance risk associated with pandemic influenza as previously reported for a severe event considered to be a recurrence of the 1918 flu epidemic the analysis indicates aig could incur a pre tax loss of approximately 6 2 billion if this event were to recur for a mild event considered to be a recurrence of the influenza epidemic of 1968 the analysis indicates aig could incur a pre tax loss of approximately 0 6 billion if such an event were to recur these analyses were based on 2007 policy data representing approximately 95 percent of aigs individual life group life and credit life books of business net of reinsurance at that point in time these estimates do not include claims that could be made under other policies such as business interruption or general liability policies and does not reflect estimates for losses resulting from disruption of aigs own business operations or asset valuation losses that may arise consequent to such a pandemic these related losses may be significant and in some scenarios exceed the losses incurred from aigs life insurance coverages although it is too early to be definitive about the likely dimensions of the aggregate life insurance loss if there is a swift and effective response for its containment some key features of the swine flu virus that place its likely impact toward the lower end of the range provided above are as follows data table removed 163 american international group inc and subsidiaries recent accounting standards accounting changes in
