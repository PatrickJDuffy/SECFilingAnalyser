table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures use of non gaap measures throughout this md and a we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful representative and transparent some of the measurements we use are nongaap financial measures under sec rules and regulations gaap is the acronym for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the nongaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarlynamed measures reported by other companies book value per common share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci is used to show the amount of our net worth on a pershare basis we believe book value per common share excluding aoci is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of noncash items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio and foreign currency translation adjustments book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders equity excluding aoci by total common shares outstanding the reconciliation to book value per common share the most comparable gaap measure is presented in the executive overview section of this md and a we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of aig and our business segments we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors when we use these measures reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided in the results of operations section of this md and a aig aftertax operating income loss attributable to aig is derived by excluding the following items from net income loss attributable to aig data table removed aig property casualty pretax operating income loss includes both underwriting income loss and net investment income but excludes net realized capital gains losses other income expense net and legal settlements related to legacy crisis matters described above underwriting income loss is derived by reducing net premiums earned by claims and claims adjustment expenses incurred acquisition expenses and general operating expenses 79 table of contents item 2 use of non gaap measures ratios aig property casualty along with most property and casualty insurance companies uses the loss ratio the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every 100 of net premiums earned the amount of claims and claims adjustment expense and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss the underwriting environment varies across countries and products as does the degree of litigation activity all of which affect such ratios in addition investment returns local taxes cost of capital regulation product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios accident year loss and combined ratios as adjusted both the accident year loss and

increased in the three month period ended june 30 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and a favorable loss reserve development compared to an adverse loss reserve development in the prior year partially offset by an increase in the frequency and severity of severe losses and a decrease in net investment income pre tax operating income decreased in the six month period ended june 30 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease in net investment income and a slight decrease in underwriting income aig life and retirement pre tax operating income improved for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year reflecting higher fee income from strong growth in assets under management partially offset by lower investment income primarily due to strong returns on alternative investments in the prior year periods and lower base investment yield disciplined pricing of new business and active management of renewal crediting rates for interest rate sensitive business together with the run off of older business with relatively high crediting rates has largely offset the pressure on investment yields in the sustained low interest rate environment premiums and deposits increased in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to continued strong demand for variable annuities in the retirement income solutions product line and improved sales of fixed annuities which have benefitted from slightly higher market interest rates compared to the prior year periods mortgage guaranty pretax operating income improved in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to an increase in net premiums earned and an increase in favorable prior year loss reserve development new insurance written decreased in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to declining levels of mortgage refinancing activity our investment portfolio performance improved slightly in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to positive performance on bonds for which we elected the fair value option primarily driven by lower interest rates since december 31 2013 net realized capital gains declined in the three and six month periods ended june 30 2014 compared to the same periods in the prior year due to lower capital gains from sales of investments related to capital loss carryforward utilization and higher fair value losses on embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantee features net of

received as consideration from the sale investment highlights net investment income increased to 3 9 billion and 8 1 billion for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2014 respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year net investment income for our insurance operations decreased by approximately 131 million and 259 million for the three and six month periods ended june 30 2014 respectively compared to the same periods in the prior year due to lower reinvestment yields and lower income on alternative investments although returns on alternative investments continue to benefit from strong equity market performance while corporate debt securities represented the core of new investment allocations we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed income securities with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 19 4 billion as of june 30 2014 from approximately 11 7 billion as of december 31 2013 due to a decline in interest rates over the period and the narrowing of credit spreads the overall credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio remains largely unchanged from december 31 2013 strategic outlook industry trends our business is affected by industry and economic factors such as interest rates credit and equity market conditions catastrophic claims events regulation tax policy competition and general economic market and political conditions we continued to operate under difficult market conditions in 2014 characterized by factors such as historically low interest rates instability in the global markets and slowing growth in emerging markets china and euro zone economies interest rates remain low relative to historical levels which have affected our industry by reducing investment returns in addition current market conditions may not necessarily permit insurance companies to increase pricing across all our product lines 86 table of contents item 2 executive overview data table removed outlook for our operating businesses the outlook for each of our

initiatives and opportunities for each of our businesses aig property casualty strategic initiatives and outlook data table removed market conditions and industry trends aig property casualty expects the current low interest rate environment relative to historical levels currency volatility and ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions will continue to challenge the growth of net investment income and limit growth in some markets due to these conditions and overcapacity in the property casualty insurance industry aig property 87 table of contents item 2 executive overview casualty has sought to modify terms and conditions grow profitable segments of the business exit unprofitable businesses and develop advanced data analytics to improve profitability aig property casualty has observed improving trends in certain key indicators that may offset the effect of current economic challenges in recent years aig property casualty has benefitted from favorable pricing trends particularly in its u s commercial business however such trends have tapered off in recent quarters the property casualty insurance industry is experiencing modest growth as a result of this positive rate trend and an increase in overall exposures in certain markets aig property casualty also expects that expansion in certain growth economies will occur at a faster pace than in developed countries although at levels lower than those previously expected due to revised economic assumptions during the second quarter of 2014 within the u s commercial property business aig property casualty observed continued rate pressure in the u s excess and surplus lines market particularly with respect to its natural catastrophe exposed business aig property casualtys strategy is to continue to differentiate its capacity from its peers through leveraging managements significant experience with catastrophic events providing loss prevention expertise and maintaining discipline in pricing to internal targets despite intense competition in the u s aig property casualtys exposure to terrorism risk is mitigated by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 tripra in addition to limited private reinsurance protections tripra is set to expire on december 31 2014 aig property casualty is closely monitoring the legislative developments related to the tripra

factors reserves and exposures and item 7 md and a enterprise risk management insurance operations risks aig property casualty key insurance risks terrorism risk in the 2013 annual report strategic initiatives growth and business mix aig property casualty continues efforts to better segment its business by industry geography and type of coverage in order to enhance its decision making regarding risk acceptance and pricing for example within workers compensation aig property casualty has observed different experience and trends based on this segmentation which helps inform its risk appetite pricing and loss mitigation decisions as part of aig property casualtys strategy to expand its consumer operations in growth economies on may 29 2013 aig property casualty entered into a joint venture agreement with picc life insurance company limited picc life a subsidiary of the peoples insurance company group of china limited picc group to form an agency distribution company in china to

continues to explore other potential life insurance and accident and health opportunities internationally capital efficiency aig property casualty continues to execute capital management initiatives by enhancing broadbased risk tolerance guidelines for its operating units implementing underwriting strategies to increase return on equity by line of business and reducing exposure to businesses with inadequate pricing and increased loss trends in addition aig property casualty remains focused on enhancing its global reinsurance strategy to improve overall capital efficiency which may lead to periodic income statement volatility 88 table of contents item 2 executive overview aig property casualty also continues to streamline its legal entity structure to enhance transparency for regulators and optimize capital and tax efficiency the legal entity restructuring initiatives have enhanced aig property casualtys dividend capacity reduced required capital and provided tax benefits additionally the restructurings allow aig property casualty to simplify its reinsurance arrangements which further facilitates increased capital optimization in the six months ended june 30 2014 aig property casualty continued the integration of its japan operations through the conversion of the american home assurance companys japan branch to a subsidiary of the japan holding company effective on april 1 2014 aig property casualty expects its overall legal entity restructuring to be substantially completed in 2015 subject to regulatory approvals in the relevant jurisdictions aig life and retirement strategic initiatives and outlook data table removed market conditions and industry trends baby boomers reaching retirement age expect to live longer in retirement and place less reliance on traditional pensions and government retirement benefits than previous generations these demographic trends combined with strong equity markets and low volatility provide a favorable environment for sales of individual variable annuities and have contributed to growth in separate account assets under management in both retirement income solutions and group retirement product lines an increasing demographic of americans approaching retirement and seeking guaranteed income features combined with changes in the competitive landscape provide opportunities to continue growing aig life and retirements position in the individual variable annuities market the interest rate environment has a significant impact on the life and annuity industry low long term interest rates put pressure on long term investment returns negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products such as fixed annuities and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products low interest rates may also affect future investment margins and may affect the recoverability and amortization rate of dac assets in variable annuity fixed annuity and universal life businesses while long term interest rates have continued to remain low relative to historical levels the modest increase in rates since the first quarter of 2013 has caused demand for fixed annuities products to improve and continued stable or modestly rising interest rates would provide favorable market conditions for fixed annuity sales and future profitability aig life and retirement will continue to actively manage renewal crediting rates and use a disciplined approach to pricing new sales of interest rate sensitive products including minimum rate guarantees also as market conditions change asset and liability interest rate exposures and strategic asset allocation are managed to emphasize lower or higher durations in the investment portfolio 89 table of contents item 2 executive overview product diversity and capacity for growth aig life and retirement has been able to meet the demand for guaranteed products and grow sales while managing risk by offering competitive products with strong de risking features such as volatility control funds rider fees indexed to a market volatility index and required minimum allocations to fixed accounts and using a dynamic risk hedging program in addition to individual variable annuities the retirement income solutions product line is expanding the offerings of index annuities including those with guarantee features to provide additional solutions for consumers approaching retirement sales in the fixed annuities product line have improved compared to the same periods in the prior year and could strengthen if interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens as these market conditions make fixed annuity products more attractive compared to alternatives such as bank deposits industry sales of individual life products have continued their overall downward trend particularly in the past several quarters aig life and retirement is targeting growth by offering differentiated product solutions to better meet consumer needs and by expanding distribution of life products through new channels and relationships while maintaining pricing discipline as an integral component of its overall strategy advanced underwriting approaches that leverage existing capabilities within aig are another key focus in aig life and retirements drive for a sustainable competitive advantage in this product line the institutional markets product line is expected to continue contributing to growth in assets under management from increased stable value wrap business as well as from disciplined growth through the pursuit of select opportunities related to the terminal funding and pension buyout business other operations strategic initiatives and outlook mortgage guaranty ugc data table removed market conditions and industry trends during 2013 refinancing activity drove much of the increased volume in the mortgage loan industry due to historically low residential mortgage interest rates however the majority of ugcs increase in new business written in 2013 was originated from home purchases as opposed to refinancings although ugc believes that home purchases will increase during 2014 primarily due to increased buyer confidence arising from home price appreciation and residential mortgage interest rates remaining low relative to historical levels ugc continues to anticipate a decrease in new insurance written during 2014 compared to 2013 as higher residential mortgage interest rates from the third quarter of 2013 through the second quarter of 2014 have reduced refinancing activity 90 table of contents item 2 executive overview while higher residential mortgage interest rates have had an unfavorable impact on new mortgage loan volumes particularly on refinancing activity ugc expects current residential mortgage interest rates to have a favorable impact on the persistency of business written from 2011 through 2013 since refinancing of mortgage loans would be unattractive to homeowners who originated mortgages at the historically low residential mortgage interest rates prevalent during that period ugc expects that this higher persistency will continue to benefit its results throughout 2014 and into 2015 ugc also expects that newly reported delinquencies will decline during 2014 and into 2015 and cure rates will improve as a result of home value appreciation which will encourage homeowners with delinquent mortgages to refinance or sell and purchase another home ugc believes the combination of higher persistency lower new delinquencies and improving cure rates partially offset by a decline in new mortgage loan volumes will result in favorable operating results for ugc throughout 2014 ugcs continued success as well as the success of the mortgage insurance industry can be significantly affected by changes in regulatory and legislative developments and changes in the charters and business practices of freddie mac and fannie mae collectively the gses on july 10 2014 the gses issued in draft form for public comment new eligibility requirements used to approve private mortgage insurers that provide insurance on loans owned or guaranteed by the gses it is unclear what the final eligibility requirements will be however if adopted as issued new requirements would include among other things higher capital requirements and heightened liquidity requirements the national association of insurance commissioners the naic has begun drafting a new model law for mortgage insurance a primary focus of the naics effort is to develop a risk based capital rbc model that will replace or supplement the current 25 1 risk to surplus requirements this rbc model law may impact the amount of statutory surplus certain ugc subsidiaries must maintain in addition the new model law may have an impact on various other business practices such as underwriting and claims mitigation practices in addition to possible impacts on liquidity and other financial thresholds ugc cannot predict the potential effects new gse eligibility requirements and a new model law may have on its business results of operations cash flows and financial condition strategic initiatives risk selection during 2014 ugc expects to continue to be a leading private provider of mortgage insurance and to differentiate itself from its competitors by providing superior service and products to its customers by utilizing its proprietary risk based pricing strategy this pricing strategy provides ugcs customers with mortgage insurance products that are priced commensurate with the underwriting risk which ugc believes will result in an appropriately priced high quality book of business ugc plans to continue to execute this strategy throughout 2014 the business generated under this strategy which was initiated during 2009 accounted for approximately 65 percent of net premiums earned in the six month period ended june 30 2014 91 table of contents item 2 executive overview global capital markets aig

aigfp the dib portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due even under stress scenarios and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives the dibs assets consist primarily of cash shortterm investments fixed maturity securities issued by corporations u s government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset backed securities the value of these assets is impacted by macroeconomic trends in u s and core european markets including corporate credit spreads commercial and residential real estate markets and to a lesser extent interest rates and foreign exchange rates among other factors the majority of these assets are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through earnings the dibs liabilities consist primarily of notes and other borrowings supported by assets as well as other shortterm financing obligations the dib has both liabilities that are held at cost and liabilities that are held at fair value the liabilities held at fair value vary in price based on changes in aigs credit spreads with changes in fair value reflected in earnings changes in the fundamental drivers of the fair value of dib assets and liabilities will create earnings volatility for the dib on a

and evaluates the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by class of business for example if loss emergence for a class of business is different than expected for certain accident years we examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that class of business in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the reserves for the class of business for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable as appropriate we make adjustments for the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence for each accident year as part of our reserving process we also consider notices of claims received with respect to emerging and or evolving issues in the three month period ended june 30 2014 the favorable prior year

assetliability management process product design elements and crediting rate strategies a prolonged low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability disciplined pricing on new business is used to continue to pursue new sales of life and annuity products at targeted net investment spreads in the current low interest rate environment aig life and retirement has a dynamic product management process to ensure that new business offerings appropriately reflect the current interest rate environment to the extent that aig life and retirement cannot achieve targeted net investment spreads on new business products are re priced or no longer sold additionally existing products with higher minimum rate guarantees have been re filed with lower crediting rates as permitted under state insurance product regulations new sales of fixed annuity products generally have minimum interest rate guarantees of 1 percent universal life insurance interest rate guarantees are generally 2 to 3 percent on new non indexed products and zero to 2 percent on new indexed products and are designed to be sufficiently low to meet targeted net investment spreads aig life and retirement is in the process of lowering the minimum guaranteed interest rates on new universal life products and expects this process to be substantially completed in 2014 renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions in annuity and universal life products that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre established intervals subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees aig life and retirement has adjusted and will continue to adjust crediting rates to maintain targeted net investment spreads on both new business and in force business where crediting rates are above minimum guarantees in addition to annuity and universal life products certain traditional long duration products for which aig life and retirement does not have the ability to adjust interest rates such as payout annuities expose aig life and retirement to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a prolonged low interest rate environment see aig life

growth assumption is applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset based fees in determining the asset growth rate the effect of short term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology whereby short term asset growth above or below the long term annual rate assumption will impact the growth assumption applied to the five year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date when actual performance significantly deviates from the annual long term growth assumption as evidenced by growth assumptions for the five year reversion to the mean period remaining below a certain rate floor or above a certain rate cap for a sustained period judgment may be applied to revise or unlock the growth rate assumptions to be used for both the five year reversion to the mean period as well as the long term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods for variable annuities in the retirement income solutions product line the assumed annual growth rate has remained above zero percent for the five year reversion to the mean period and therefore has not met the criteria for adjustment

gcm specifically through the entity aig markets gcm is required to clear certain derivatives transactions through central regulated clearing organizations pursuant to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank to the extent a derivatives transaction is subject to a clearing obligation gcm is required to post collateral in amounts determined by the relevant clearing organization and gcms clearing agreements with its futures commission merchants to the extent a derivatives transaction is not subject to a clearing obligation these derivative transactions are governed by bilateral master agreements the form of which is published by the international swaps and derivatives association inc isda many of these agreements primarily between gcm and third party financial institutions require collateral postings many of gcms transactions with aig and its subsidiaries also include collateral posting requirements the purpose of which are to provide collateral to gcm which in turn is used to satisfy posting requirements with third parties including the margin requirements of clearing organizations and futures commission merchants in addition most of gcms cdss within aigfp are subject to collateral posting provisions the collateral posting provisions contained in the isda master agreements and related transaction documents with respect to cdss differ among counterparties and asset classes the amount of future collateral posting requirements for super senior cdss is a function of our credit ratings the rating of the relevant reference obligations and the market value of the relevant reference obligations with market value being the most significant factor we estimate the amount of potential future collateral postings associated with the super senior cdss using various methodologies the contingent liquidity requirements associated with such potential future collateral postings are incorporated into our liquidity planning assumptions as of june 30 2014 and december 31 2013 gcm had total assets of 6 7 billion and 7 7 billion respectively and total liabilities of 3 2 billion and 3 1 billion respectively gcms assets consist primarily of

collateral that exceeded the fair value of derivatives as of the reporting date direct investment book the dib portfolio is being wound down and is managed with the objective of ensuring that at all times it maintains the liquidity we believe is necessary to meet all of its liabilities as they come due even under stress scenarios and to maximize returns consistent with our risk management objectives we are focused on meeting the dibs liquidity needs including the need for contingent liquidity arising from collateral posting for debt positions of the dib without relying on resources beyond the dib as part of this program management we may from time to time access the capital markets including issuing and repurchasing debt and selling assets on an opportunistic basis in each case subject to market conditions if the dibs risk target is breached we expect to take appropriate actions to increase the dibs liquidity sources or reduce liquidity requirements to maintain the risk target although no assurance can be given that this can be achieved under thenprevailing market conditions any additional liquidity shortfalls would need to be funded by aig parent from time to time we may utilize cash allocated to the dib that is not required to meet the risk target for the dib for general corporate purposes unrelated to the dib the dibs assets consist primarily of cash short term investments fixed maturity securities issued by corporations u s government and government sponsored entities and mortgage and asset backed securities the dibs liabilities consist primarily of

facilities we maintain a committed revolving syndicated credit facility as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes on june 19 2014 we amended and restated the four year syndicated credit facility that was entered into in october 2012 the previous facility the amended and restated five year syndicated credit facility the five year facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and or standby letters of credit of up to 4 0 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings the previous facility had a 2 0 billion sublimit on letters of credit and is scheduled to expire in june 2019 the previous facility was scheduled to expire in october 2016 as of june 30 2014 a total of approximately 3 9 billion remains available under the five year facility our ability to borrow under the five year facility is not contingent on our credit ratings however our ability to borrow under the five year facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal operating administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the five year facility these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the five year facility would restrict our access to the five year facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity we expect to borrow under the five year facility from time to time and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes contingent liquidity facilities aig parent has access to a contingent liquidity facility of up to 500 million as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes under this facility we have the unconditional right prior to december 15 2015 to issue up to 500 million in senior debt to the

investments in addition aig life and retirement businesses maintain significant levels of investment grade rated fixed maturity securities including substantial holdings in government and corporate bonds and could seek to monetize those holdings in the event operating cash flows are insufficient we expect liquidity needs related to gic liabilities to be funded through cash flows generated from

needs of each operating unit the investment objectives are driven by the respective business models for aig property casualty aig life and retirement and aig parent including the dib the primary objectives are generation of investment income preservation of capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities investments highlights during the six months ended june 30 2014 a decrease in interest rates on investment grade fixed maturity securities and narrowing spreads of high yield securities resulted in net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio net unrealized gains in our available for sale portfolio increased to approximately 19 4 billion as of june 30 2014 from approximately 11 7 billion as of december 31 2013 we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities and increased lending activities in commercial mortgage loans with favorable risk versus return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income net investment income benefitted from positive performance on bonds for which we elected the fair value option primarily driven by lower rates and narrowing credit spreads although income on alternative investments was lower than prior periods returns on these investments exceeded those of other asset classes blended investment yields on new aig life and retirement and aig property casualty investments were lower than blended rates on investments that were sold matured or called other than temporary impairments remained at low levels with a small portion of impairments attributable to structured securities the sale of ilfc to aercap resulted in aig receiving a 46 percent ownership interest in the outstanding common stock of aercap which is included in other invested assets and accounted for under the equity method investment strategies investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market general market conditions liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification some of our key investment strategies are as follows while more of a focus is placed on asset liability matching in aig life and retirement our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration to the extent practicable fixed maturity securities held by the domestic insurance companies included in aig property casualty consist of a mix of tax exempt municipal bonds and taxable instruments that meet our current risk return tax liquidity credit quality and diversification objectives 162 table of contents item 2 investments outside of the u s fixed maturity securities held by aig property casualty consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate aig parents liquidity sources are held in the form of cash short term investments and publicly traded intermediate term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities aig parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products counterparties and duration based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer term funding needs aig parent purchases publicly traded intermediate term investment grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity credit ratings at june 30 2014 approximately 90 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our domestic entities approximately 17 percent of such securities were rated aaa by one or more of the principal rating agencies and approximately 16 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated our investment decision process relies primarily on internally generated fundamental analysis and internal risk ratings third party rating services ratings and opinions provide one source of independent perspective for consideration in the internal analysis a significant portion of our foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is rated by moodys s and p or similar foreign rating services rating services are not available for some foreign issued securities our credit risk management department closely reviews the credit quality of the foreign portfolios non rated fixed maturity securities at june 30 2014 approximately 16 percent of such investments were either rated aaa or on the basis of our internal analysis were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated aaa and approximately 4 percent were rated below investment grade or not rated approximately 44 percent of the foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance composite aig credit ratings with respect to our fixed maturity investments the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect a a composite of the ratings of the three major

property casualty the duration of liabilities for long tail casualty lines is greater than that for other lines as opposed to the focus in aig life and retirement the focus is not on asset liability matching but on preservation of capital and growth of surplus fixed maturity investments of aig property casualtys domestic operations with an average duration of 3 9 years are currently comprised primarily of tax exempt securities which provide attractive risk adjusted after tax returns as well as taxable municipal bonds government and agency bonds and corporate bonds the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings fixed maturity investments held in aig property casualtys foreign operations are of high quality rated a or higher based on composite ratings and short to intermediate duration averaging 4 4 years while invested assets backing reserves are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities in aig property casualtys domestic operations a modest portion of surplus is allocated to alternative investments including private equity and hedge funds these investments have provided a combination of added diversification and attractive long term returns over time aig life and retirement the investment strategy of aig life and retirement is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value subject to liquidity requirements capital constraints diversification requirements assetliability matching and available investment opportunities aig life and retirement uses assetliability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in our businesses aig life and retirements objective is to maintain an investment portfolio with assets having weighted average durations that are matched to the duration and cash flow profile of its liabilities to the extent practicable the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities

defined as the potential loss arising from adverse fluctuations in equity and commodity prices residential and commercial real estate values interest rates credit spreads foreign currencies inflation and their levels of volatility we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets businesses the chief risk officer within each such business is responsible for properly identifying these risks then ensuring that they are appropriately measured monitored and managed in accordance with the written risk governance framework established by the chief market risk officer cmro our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables distinct from the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function risk identification market risk quantifies the adverse impact on us due to broad systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers equity market prices we are exposed to equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments these include direct investments in publiclytraded shares investments in private equity hedge funds and mutual funds exchangetraded funds and other equitylinked capital market instruments as well as other equitylinked insurance products including but not limited to equityindexed annuities variable annuities universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance residential and commercial real estate values our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments residential investments include residential mortgages residential mortgagebacked securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential mortgages trusts that include real estate and or mortgages reits and mortgage insurance contracts commercial exposures include mortgage loans commercial mortgage backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include commercial mortgages trusts reits and other investments interest rates interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities low interest rates mean less investment income and potentially less attractive insurance products conversely higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons however when rates rise quickly there can be a temporary asymmetric gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value which is largely reported in other comprehensive income and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized credit spread or risk premium credit spreads measure an instruments risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration defaultfree instrument much like higher interest rates wider credit spreads mean more investment income in the longterm in the short term quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing securities which is largely reported in other comprehensive income a precipitous rise in credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the creditworthiness of bond obligors potentially resulting in default losses 180 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management foreign currency exchange rates we are a globally diversified enterprise with significant income assets and liabilities denominated in and significant capital deployed in a variety of currencies commodity prices changes in the value of commodities can affect the valuation of publiclytraded commodities commodity indices and derivatives inflation changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities including debt securities linked to inflation index returns derivatives on inflation indices and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly via indexing or implicitly through medical costs or wage levels in our primary casualty business risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures at the firmwide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aigs risk appetite statement this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity we have available within our framework at the market risk level the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels under specified stress tests in addition we continue to develop economic u s gaap accounting and statutory capitalbased risk measures at the market risk level businessunit level and firmwide levels this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures we use a number of approaches to measure our market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input examples of such sensitivities include a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity securities a one basis point increase in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities and a one percent increase in price on equity securities scenario analysis scenario analysis uses historical hypothetical or forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios to assess and report exposures examples of hypothetical scenarios include a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve or a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in worldwide equity markets stress testing stress testing is a special form of scenario analysis in which the scenarios are designed to lead to a material adverse outcome examples of such scenarios include the stock market crash of october 1987 or the widening of yields or spread of rmbs or cmbs during 2008 181 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management market risk sensitivities the following table provides estimates of our sensitivity to changes in yield curves equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates data table removed a at june 30 2014 the analysis covered 296 billion of 315 billion interest rate sensitive assets excluded are 2 billion in dib assets 7 billion of loans and 4 billion of investments in life settlements in addition 6 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations at december 31 2013 the analysis covered 283 billion of 306 billion interest rate sensitive assets excluded are 6 billion in dib assets 5 billion of loans and 4 billion of investments in life settlements in addition 8 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling and or data limitations b commencing in the first quarter of 2014 we began using a duration and convexity method to estimate the impact of a 100 bps increase in interest rates on each security the change in method resulted in no material effect on the amounts presented at december 31 2013 c includes our investments in picc group and picc p and c d the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag foreign currency denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated nonu s dollar assets less our consolidated nonu s dollar liabilities on a u s gaap basis we use a bottom up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level we manage cash flow risk on our foreign currency denominated debt issued by aig parent and use a variety of techniques to mitigate this risk including but not limited to the execution of cross currency swaps and the issuance of new foreign currency denominated debt to replace equivalent maturing debt at the aig parent level we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits as a matter of general practice we do not typically hedge our foreign currency exposures to net investments in subsidiaries however we may utilize either cross currency swaps or our foreign currency denominated debt as a net investment hedge of our capital in subsidiaries at june 30 2014 our five largest foreign currency net asset positions were denominated in australian dollars british pounds canadian dollars hong kong dollars and japanese yen our foreign currency denominated net asset position at june 30 2014 decreased by 7 million compared to december 31 2013 the decrease was mostly due to a 247 million decrease in our euro position primarily resulting from bond hedging and a 182 million decrease in our polish zloty position primarily 182 table of contents item 2 enterprise risk management resulting from the sale of our equity investment in santander consumer bank partially offset by a 241 million increase in our japanese yen position mainly attributable to japanese yen deferred tax liability reduction a 95 million increase in our new zealand dollar position primarily resulting from a decrease in loss reserves at ai overseas association and a 91 million increase in our canadian dollar position mainly attributable to an increase in operating income from underwriting and investments for illustrative purposes we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u s dollar the estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short term cash collateral or other financial obligations the failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in reduced operating flexibility increased costs and reputational harm because liquidity is critically important our liquidity governance includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address aig specific broader industry and market related liquidity events sources of liquidity risk can include but are not limited to financial market movements significant changes in interest rates can provide incentives for policyholders to surrender their policies changes in markets can impact collateral posting requirements or limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs due to unfavorable market conditions inadequate market depth or other investors seeking to sell the same or similar assets potential reputational events or credit downgrade changes can have an impact on policyholder cancellations and withdrawals or impact collateral posting requirements and catastrophic events including natural and manmade disasters that can increase policyholder claims the principal objective of our liquidity risk framework is to protect our liquidity position and identify a diversity of funding sources available to meet actual and contingent liabilities during both normal and stress periods this framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are established for base and stress scenarios over a time horizon covering a period greater than one year we maintain a liquidity buffer designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions if we project that we will breach the tolerance we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions however the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements we strive to manage our liquidity prudently at a legal entity level across aig parent and the operating companies key components of the framework include effective corporate governance and policy maintaining diversified sources of liquidity contingency funding plans and regular review of liquidity metrics in both normal and stress conditions we view each component of the framework together to achieve our goal of sound liquidity risk management 183 table of contents item 2 critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial
