consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions long term aspirational goals following the completion of the recapitalization aig is developing business plans for its operations in relation to certain long term aspirational goals among the most significant of aig enterprise wide long term aspirational goals are the following to increase its roe to 10 percent or more by the year ended december 31 2015 from its 6 2 percent normalized roe as of and for the year ended december 31 2010 and to achieve average annual percentage growth of its eps in the mid teens through the year ended december 31 2015 from normalized eps of 2 62 for the year ended december 31 2010 roe and eps in this context are the non gaap measures described above the calculation of roe and eps for the year ended december 31 2010 which is used as a baseline was determined by making certain adjustments to after tax operating income loss attributable to aig as described in the reconciliation below to calculate normalized after tax operating income attributable to aig the baseline roe was calculated using adjusted shareholders equity reduced by the net prepaid commitment fee asset remaining at december 31 2010 and assuming full conversion of aig equity units as described in the reconciliation below all amounts or percentages in this section are approximate these aspirational goals are premised on a number of significant assumptions including the following assumptions and are by their nature subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies many of which are outside aig control aig goal is to generate by seeking to take advantage of global opportunities approximately 4 billion to 5 billion of incremental aggregate pre tax operating income in 2015 compared to its normalized pre tax operating income for 2010 aig goals are to continue to strengthen and grow its businesses by seeking to capitalize on global opportunities maintaining well positioned broad franchises in appropriate markets diversifying aig businesses in product and geography and utilizing aig underwriting skills across multiple lines and multiple geographies the achievement of this goal is dependent upon improved performance by aig businesses in particular for this goal aig assumes that chartis will have achieved an average annual growth rate in net premiums written of approximately 6 percent from 2010 to 2015 and by the year ended december 31 2015 a combined ratio of between 90 and 95 which would result in an unleveraged return on equity of 10 to 12 percent assuming an annual investment yield of approximately 4 percent for the year ended december 31 2015 sunamerica will have achieved by the year ended december 31 2015 assets under management of 320 billion and life insurance in force of 1 trillion which would result in an unleveraged return on equity of 9 percent for the year ended december 31 2015 these compare to assets under management of 249 billion and life insurance in force of 909 billion at december 31 2010 and an unleveraged return on equity of 7 4 percent for the year ended december 31 2010 normalized to exclude the maiden lane

tax operating income 92 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries aig interests in maiden lane iii will have produced an annual pre tax return of approximately 9 percent the goals of aig investment strategy include generating approximately 500 million to 700 million in additional annual pre tax net investment income by fully investing its investable cash at december 31 2010 aig had approximately 21 billion of investable cash a large portion of which was originally intended to be used for the purchase of the maiden lane ii securities as of march 31 2011 this investable cash had been reduced to approximately 14 billion had aig been fully invested during 2010 aig estimates that its net investment income for 2010 would have been approximately 500 to 700 million higher aig has been actively redeploying its investable cash into higher yielding assets with the goal of achieving attractive risk adjusted returns in relation to its insurance liabilities aig assumes it will achieve an average yield of 4 percent to 5 percent on those new cash investments by employing aig current investment strategy the goal of aig cost rationalization effort is to reduce aig annual general and administration expenses by approximately 1 billion by the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 2010 expenses aig has made and expects to continue to make substantial investments in infrastructure to serve its business portfolio efficiently and eliminate redundancies including its information technology finance underwriting and claims infrastructure and is also expanding its sourcing capabilities globally aig goal is to generate through december 31 2015 approximately 25 billion to 30 billion of deployable capital to be applied to among other things potential share repurchases dividend payments acquisitions or organic business opportunities for purposes of setting the roe and eps goals such capital deployment has been assumed to take the form of share repurchases without material increase in financial leverage or reduction in interest coverage any share repurchase programs approved by aig board of directors and regulators are expected to be sufficiently flexible such that they may be modified in the event of a major catastrophic loss significant change in the underwriting cycle or change in future investment performance to the extent that aig applies this deployable capital for dividend payments acquisitions or organic business opportunities rather than for share repurchases aig may not be able to achieve its aspirational roe and eps goals in setting these aspirational goals aig has made significant assumptions with respect to among other things the general conditions of markets in which it operates revenues and combined ratios of its subsidiaries investment yields subsidiaries capacity to distribute dividends to aig parent aig ability to apply deployable capital to share repurchases dividend payments acquisitions or organic growth aig ability to maintain financial leverage commensurate with its current credit ratings the exclusion of the impact on shareholders equity of the reversal of the tax valuation allowance the effectiveness of aig cost rationalization measures the approval of planned actions including with respect to any share repurchases dividend payments or acquisitions by aig regulators the overall credit rating implications of aig proposed strategic actions and general financial market and interest rate conditions given the significance of the assumptions used and the uncertainties surrounding them there are significant risks that these assumptions may not be realized and thus the aspirational goals may not be achieved accordingly aig actual results are likely to differ from these goals and

available cash in order to increase its net investment income streamlining operations and controlling expenses completing the active unwind of aigfp portfolios by june 30 2011 and closing the nan shan sale chartis given current property and casualty industry capital levels and overall economic conditions 2011 is anticipated to be a challenging year as chartis expects a weak growth environment in most developed economies the weakness of ratable exposures i e asset values payrolls and sales in 2010 and its negative impact on the overall market premium base as well as continued weakness in u s commercial insurance rates are likely to continue well into 2011 however in the first quarter of 2011 chartis has observed that the extent of ratable exposure weakness in the united states is beginning to abate in certain growth economies such as brazil turkey india and asia pacific countries chartis expects improved growth rates in 2011 chartis continues to execute on its strategy of growing its higher margin and less capital intensive lines of business and as required implementing corrective actions on underperforming businesses management continues to review its underlying businesses to ensure that they meet overall performance measures while seeking to reduce the overall volatility of results in connection with these ongoing reviews during the three months ended march 31 2011 management took certain remedial actions relating to certain consumer line programs that did not meet internal performance or operating targets including the decision to reduce its net premiums written for two specific programs notwithstanding these actions chartis u s expects to continue to grow its consumer lines business and excluding these specific actions the overall consumer business continues to see growth in line with management expectations to the extent that the aforementioned ratable exposures continue to improve chartis u s expects moderate growth in both gross and net written premiums in 2011 chartis u s expects continued growth within its consumer lines business and an overall decline in certain classes of its commercial lines businesses because the consumer lines of business generally carry higher origination costs than commercial lines chartis u s expects an overall increase in its expense ratio due to the change in mix of business however these increases are expected to be largely offset by on going expense saving initiatives that were introduced in 2010 chartis international expects continued growth of its net written premiums in 2011 given its well established franchises and operations expectations for continued globalization and growth in the gross domestic product within countries included in the growth economies region chartis international intends to increase its insurance penetration and growth within commercial liability businesses overseas this growth is expected in the far east and growth economies regions strong pricing discipline in a continued soft market is expected to keep the europe region net written premiums at levels consistent with 2010 far east growth in 2011 is expected to be attributable in part to the full year inclusion of the fuji results of operations compared to only six months of results in 2010 further in connection with the acquisition of a controlling interest in fuji in 2010 chartis recognized certain net intangible liabilities related to the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the insurance contracts acquired on february 10 2011 chartis announced a cash tender offer for the 45 2 percent of outstanding fuji shares that it did not already own as well as outstanding stock acquisition rights as a result of the offer at march 31 2011 chartis owned 98 4 percent of the aggregate shares of fuji chartis intends ultimately to acquire the remaining minority shares making fuji a wholly owned subsidiary of chartis this acquisition is consistent with chartis strategy to diversify its portfolio of businesses on both a geographic and product line basis and is intended to strengthen chartis position in the consolidating japanese market while enabling fuji to benefit from chartis global operational resources and financial strength see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 95 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries on march 11 2011 a major earthquake occurred near the northeast coast of honshu japan triggering a tsunami in the pacific ocean this disaster is now named the great tohoku earthquake and tsunami the tohoku catastrophe the following table summarizes chartis charges related to the tohoku catastrophe data table removed chartis u s losses included approximately 200 million relating to reinsurance protection it provides to chartis international as part of chartis overall capital management and reinsurance strategies chartis u s received reinstatement premiums of 25 million from chartis international in connection with this protection the claims and claims adjustment expenses above include 436 million relating to chartis participation in the japanese earthquake reinsurance company jerc the jerc is a joint government private sector insurance system that is the exclusive provider of earthquake coverage for personal dwellings and their contents in japan under the jerc system a maximum of 5 5 trillion yen 67 billion at the march 31 2011 exchange rate of industry wide losses will be covered by the japanese government the jerc and private general insurance companies in japan through five layers of liability fuji is a 6 2 percent shareholder of the jerc as such fuji in accordance with japanese statutory accounting rules as well as the requirements of private sector participants in the jerc had previously established reserves of approximately 482 million for potential claims associated with earthquake damage to personal dwellings these reserves which are backed by funds held by the jerc exist to cover the potential losses that fuji could sustain in connection with jerc related claims given these statutory reserves and its current estimate of losses chartis expects minimal net effects on the statutory capital and liquidity of its japanese operations the tohoku catastrophe caused significant damage to japan transportation power manufacturing and service sectors and resulted in disruptions to supply chains particularly in the technology and automobile industries these disruptions may result in contingent business interruption cbi claims from insureds generally cbi coverage reimburses insureds for loss of business income or extra expense as a result of physical damage sustained by a supplier the insured supplier must have sustained physical damage by a peril otherwise covered by the insured property policy and subject to its respective policy terms and conditions potential cbi losses are difficult to initially ascertain due to the unique facts and circumstances of each insured supply chain and the specific conditions of its cbi coverage chartis believes that the estimated loss liabilities for this catastrophe including reserves established for cbi claims and jerc related losses are reasonable however given the unprecedented nature of the catastrophe and the inherent nature of the underlying claims the subsequent development of these liabilities in future periods could vary materially from amounts included in the accompanying financial statements in addition to its policyholder obligations chartis responded to the tohoku catastrophe with humanitarian and financial assistance through its extensive networks in japan and abroad on april 20 2011 chartis announced that it had entered into an agreement with national indemnity company nico a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc under which the majority of chartis u s asbestos liabilities will be transferred to nico as part of chartis ongoing strategy to reduce its overall loss reserve development risk the transaction with nico covers potentially volatile u s related asbestos exposures the transaction does not cover asbestos accounts that chartis believes have already been reserved to their limit of liability or certain other ancillary asbestos exposure assumed by chartis affiliates upon the closing of this transaction but effective as of january 1 2011 chartis will cede the bulk of its net asbestos liabilities to nico under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of 3 5 billion chartis will pay nico approximately 1 65 billion as consideration for this cession and nico will assume approximately 1 85 billion of net asbestos liabilities as a result of this transaction chartis

sunamerica intends to improve net investment income results in 2011 by investing its excess cash and liquid assets in longer term higher yielding securities to improve spreads while actively managing

billion at march 31 2011 after a period of historic lows interest rates generally increased at the longer part of the yield curve during the latter part of 2010 and through the first quarter of 2011 this change in the interest rate environment increased the relative attractiveness of fixed annuities compared to alternative products should interest rates remain at first quarter 2011 levels or

have resumed sales of sunamerica products during 2010 and 2011 sunamerica recently announced that its largest pre financial crisis variable annuity distribution partner has agreed to resume

account returns could trigger a favorable unlocking where the reversion to mean assumption is reset if current favorable equity market returns continue in 2011 such an unlocking could occur in 2011 which could result in higher amortization requirements in future periods such positive unlocking is not expected to be significant to sunamerica operating results sunamerica focuses on identifying

as rescissions in situations related to fraudulent or undocumented claims underwriting guideline violations and other deviations from contractual terms mostly with respect to the 2006 and 2007 vintage books of business these policy violations have resulted in loan rescissions totaling 211 million of claims on first lien business during the first three months of 2011 compared to 80 million during the same period in 2010 although rescissions will continue to affect ugc financial results they have declined as a percentage of claims due to a higher level of appeals and overturns resulting from additional resources deployed by lenders and mortgage servicers to address loan documentation issues although these items may increase volatility in the future aig believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans after consideration of rescissions and overturns consistent with industry practice foreclosure moratoriums as a result of state attorneys general investigations into lenders foreclosure practices and new financial regulations initiated in 2010 may affect ugc future financial results final resolution of these issues is unclear and ugc cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate financial impact that any of these actions individually or collectively may have on its future results of operations or financial condition in march 2011 federal regulators as required by the dodd frank act issued a proposed risk retention rule that included a definition of a qualified residential mortgage qrm whereby a maximum loan to value ratio ltv of 80 percent is required for a home purchase transaction the ltv is calculated without imputing any benefit from private mortgage insurance coverage that may be purchased for that loan the final regulations depending

reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments in addition aig survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by certain favorable

capital liquidity management and growth of surplus to support the insurance products at the local operating unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at aig consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities in the case of life insurance and retirement services companies as well as in the direct investment business the fundamental investment strategy is as nearly as is practicable to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with assets of comparable duration fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in chartis u s historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in order to meet the current risk return and tax objectives of chartis u s the domestic property and casualty companies have begun to shift investment allocations away from tax exempt municipal bonds towards taxable instruments which meet the companies liquidity duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk return and tax objectives fixed maturity securities held by chartis international companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities the market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components including interest rate environment credit spread embedded optionality such as call features liquidity structural complexity foreign exchange risk and other credit and non credit factors however in most circumstances pricing is most sensitive to interest rates such that the market price declines as interest rates rise and increases as interest rates fall this effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities aig accounts for the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies at fair value however with limited exceptions primarily with respect to separate account products on aig consolidated balance sheet aig does not modify the fair value of its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities and falling interest rates have the opposite effect this results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains losses on securities in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative inverse changes in gains losses on aig liabilities because aig asset duration in certain low yield currencies particularly japan and taiwan is shorter than its liability duration aig views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the market value

applied to these and other securities aig considers the nature of both the specific securities and the market conditions for those securities for most security types supported by real estate related assets current market yields continue to be higher than the yields were at the respective issuance dates of the securities this is largely due to investors demanding additional yield premium for

acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned generally 12 months dac is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts aig assesses the recoverability of its dac on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred this assessment is performed by comparing recorded unearned premium to the sum of expected claims claims adjustment expenses and maintenance cost unamortized dac and anticipated maintenance costs if the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded unearned premium the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for dac this offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge investment income is not anticipated in assessing the recoverability of dac increases in the expected claims and claims adjustment expenses can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge management tested the recoverability of dac and determined that recorded unearned premiums of its chartis u s and chartis international operating segments exceeded the sum of these costs at march 31 2011 by one percent and 19 percent

subsidiaries counterparties the regulatory benefit of these transactions for aigfp financial institution counterparties was generally derived from basel i in december 2010 the basel committee on banking supervision finalized basel iii which when fully implemented may reduce or eliminate the regulatory benefits to certain counterparties for these transactions and this may reduce the period of time that such counterparties are expected to hold the positions in prior years it had been expected that financial institution counterparties would complete a transition from basel i to an intermediate standard known as basel ii which could have had similar effects on the benefits of these transactions at the end of 2009 basel iii has now superseded basel ii but the details of its implementation by the various european central banking districts have not been finalized should certain counterparties continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits from these transactions those counterparties may not exercise their options to terminate the transactions in the expected time frame the weighted average expected maturity of the regulatory capital portfolio increased as of march 31 2011 by approximately 0 2 years from december 31 2010 due to certain counterparties not terminating transactions with a combined net notional amount of 3 8 billion where these counterparties continue to have a right to terminate the transaction early aigfp has extended the expected maturity dates by one year which is based on how long aigfp believes the relevant rules under basel i will remain effective where the counterparties no longer have the right to terminate early aigfp has used the weighted average life of those transactions as their expected maturity these counterparties in the corporate loan and prime residential mortgage portfolios continue to receive favorable regulatory capital benefits under basel i rules and thus aig continues to categorize them as regulatory capital transactions included in the regulatory capital portfolio are transactions with one counterparty that notified aig that it would not terminate early two of its prime residential mortgage transactions with a combined net notional amount of 24 1 billion that were expected to be terminated in the first quarter of 2010 with respect to these transactions the counterparty no longer has any rights to terminate the transactions early and is required to pay aig fees on the original notional amounts reduced only by realized losses through the final contractual maturity since the two transactions have weighted average lives that are considerably less than their final contractual maturities there is value to aigfp representing counterparty contractual fees to be received beyond the

mezzanine tranches were hedged by aigfp with other third party cds transactions in october 2008 following a credit ratings agency downgrade of aig aigfp entered into a credit support annex csa to the agreements governing the transactions with this counterparty that requires aigfp to post collateral the csa provides that one of two methodologies will be used for determining the amount of collateral to be posted the same methodology has been used throughout the term of the csa and at march 31 2011 aigfp had posted 222 million of collateral the counterparty has provided quotations from dealers that it contends support using the second methodology and contends that a total amount of approximately 1 9 billion should be posted by aigfp aigfp continues to believe that the methodology currently being used is the correct one for computing collateral that it has posted the amount of collateral required under the csa that the counterparty has not provided qualifying quotations and that the methodology the counterparty has used for calculating the amount of collateral to be posted is not valid the counterparty recently notified aigfp that it could bring litigation as soon as may 6 2011 unless an agreement is reached either regarding the method for determining the amount of collateral to be posted or regarding an alternative resolution of the matter in light of early termination experience to date and after analyses of other market data to the extent deemed relevant and available aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for any of the transactions in this regulatory capital relief portfolio for 2011 other than 1 for transactions where aigfp believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief as discussed above and 2 for transactions where the counterparty has failed to terminate the transaction early as expected and no longer has any rights to terminate early in the future although

and ratings of the underlying junior tranches are provided to capital markets for such referenced pools all of the regulatory capital cds transactions directly or indirectly reference tranched pools of large numbers of whole loans that were originated by the financial institution or its affiliates receiving the credit protection rather than structured securities containing loans originated by other third parties in the vast majority of transactions 162 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries the loans are intended to be retained by the originating financial institution and in all cases the originating financial institution is the purchaser of the cds either directly or through an intermediary as further discussed below aigfp receives information monthly or quarterly regarding the performance and credit quality of the underlying referenced assets aigfp also obtains other information such as ratings of the tranches below the super senior risk layer the nature of the information provided or otherwise available to aigfp with respect to the underlying assets in each regulatory capital cds transaction is not consistent across all transactions furthermore in a majority of corporate loan transactions and all of the residential mortgage transactions the pools are blind meaning that the identities of the obligors are not disclosed to aigfp in addition although aigfp receives periodic reports on the underlying asset pools virtually all of the regulatory capital cds transactions contain confidentiality restrictions that preclude aigfp public disclosure of information relating to the underlying referenced assets the originating financial institutions calculation agents or trustees each a report provider provide periodic reports on all underlying referenced assets as described below including for those within the blind pools while much of this information received by aigfp cannot be aggregated in a comparable way for disclosure purposes because of the confidentiality restrictions and the inconsistency of the information it does provide a sufficient basis for aigfp to evaluate the risks of the portfolio and to determine a reasonable estimate of fair value for regulatory capital cds transactions written on underlying pools of corporate loans aigfp receives monthly or quarterly updates from one or more report providers for each such referenced pool detailing with respect to the corporate loans comprising such pool the principal amount outstanding and defaults in virtually all of these reports aigfp also receives information on recoveries and realized losses aigfp also receives quarterly stratification tables for each pool incorporating geography industry and when not publicly rated the counterparty assessment of the credit quality of the underlying corporate loans additionally for a significant majority of these regulatory capital cds transactions upon the occurrence of a credit event with respect to any corporate loan included in any such pool aigfp receives a notice detailing the identity or identification number of the borrower notional amount of such loan and the effective date of such credit event ratings from independent ratings agencies for the underlying assets of the corporate loan portfolio are not universally available but aigfp estimates the ratings for the assets not rated by independent agencies by mapping the information obtained from the report providers to rating agency criteria the percent non investment grade information in the table above is provided as an indication of the nature of loans underlying the transactions not necessarily as an indicator of relative risk of the cds transactions which is determined by the individual transaction structures for example small and medium enterprise sme loan balances tend to be rated lower than loans to large well established enterprises however the greater number of loans and the smaller average size of the sme loans mitigate the risk profile of the pools in addition the transaction structures reflect aigfp assessment of the loan collateral arrangements expected recovery values and reserve accounts in determining the level of subordination required to minimize the risk of loss the percentage of non investment grade obligations in the underlying pools of corporate loans varies considerably one pool containing the highest percentages of non investment grade obligations which include all transactions with pools having non investment grade percentages greater than 45 percent are all granular sme loan pools which benefit from collateral arrangements made by the originating financial institutions and from work out of recoveries by the originating financial institutions the number of loans in this pool is 6 635 this large number of sme loans increases the predictability of the expected loss and lessens the probability that discrete events will have a meaningful impact on the results of the overall pool this transaction benefits from a tranche junior to it which was still rated aaa by at least two rating agencies at march 31 2011 two other pools with a total net notional amount of 1 1 billion have non investment grade percentages less than 45 percent with a weighted average remaining life to maturity of 3 7 years these pools have weighted average realized losses of 0 29 percent from inception through march 31 2011 and have current weighted average attachment points of 23 83 percent approximately 4 18 percent of the assets underlying the corporate loan transactions are in

subject to collateral posting provisions these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes although aigfp has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions the large majority of these obligations to date have been associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi sector cdos regulatory capital relief transactions as of march 31 2011 90 7 percent of the capital markets regulatory capital relief transactions measured by net notional amount were subject to csas linked to aig credit rating and 9 3 percent of the regulatory capital relief transactions were not subject to collateral posting provisions in general each regulatory capital relief transaction is subject to a stand alone master agreement or similar agreement under which the aggregate exposure is calculated with reference to only a single transaction the underlying mechanism that determines the amount of collateral to be posted varies by counterparty and there is no standard formula the varied mechanisms resulted from individual negotiations with different counterparties the following is a brief description of the primary mechanisms that are currently being employed to determine the amount of collateral posting for this portfolio reference to market indices under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on a formula that references certain tranches of a market index such as either itraxx or cdx this mechanism is used for cds transactions that reference either corporate loans or residential mortgages while the market index is not a direct proxy it has the advantage of being readily obtainable negotiated amount under this mechanism the amount of collateral to be posted is determined based on terms negotiated between aigfp and the counterparty which could be a fixed percentage of the notional amount or present value of premiums to be earned by aigfp 168 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents the amount of collateral postings by underlying mechanism as described above with respect to the regulatory capital relief portfolio prior to consideration of transactions other than the capital markets super senior credit default swaps subject to the same master agreements as of the periods ended data table removed arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos in the cds transactions with physical settlement provisions in respect of multi sector cdos the standard csa provisions for the calculation of exposure have been modified with the exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying cdo security rather than the replacement value of the transaction as of any date the market value of the relevant cdo security is the price at which a marketplace participant would be willing to purchase such cdo security in a market transaction on such date while the replacement value of the transaction is the cost on such date of entering into a credit default swap transaction with substantially the same terms on the same referenced obligation e g the cdo security in cases where a formula is utilized a transaction specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of exposure which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted these thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of aig and or the reference obligations with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings for the large majority of counterparties to these transactions the master agreement and csa cover non cds transactions e g interest rate and cross currency swap transactions as well as cds transactions as a result the amount of collateral to be posted by aigfp in relation to the cds transactions will be added to or offset by the amount if any of the exposure aig has to the counterparty on the non cds transactions arbitrage portfolio corporate debt clos all of the capital markets corporate arbitrage clo transactions are subject to csas these transactions are treated the same as other transactions subject to the same master agreement and csa with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard csa procedures outlined above the vast majority of corporate debt transactions are no longer subject to future collateral postings in exchange for an upfront payment to an intermediary counterparty aigfp has eliminated all future obligations to post collateral on corporate debt transactions that mature after 2011 collateral calls aigfp has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps of which a large majority relate to multi sector cdos to a lesser extent aigfp has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate arbitrage from time to time valuation methodologies used and estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference cdo securities for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by aigfp in connection with such instruments have resulted in estimates that differ at times significantly from aigfp estimates in almost all cases aigfp has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements due to the ongoing nature of collateral arrangements aigfp regularly is engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences including at the present time valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes 169 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries are like any other third party valuation considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio the following table presents the amount of collateral postings with respect to the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio prior to offsets for other transactions as of the periods ended data table removed the amount of future collateral posting requirements generally is a function of aig credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor while a high level of correlation exists between the amount of collateral posted and the valuation of these contracts in respect of the arbitrage portfolio a similar relationship does not exist with respect to the regulatory capital portfolio given the nature of how the amount of collateral for these transactions is determined given the lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of measures undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption aigfp is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it may be required to post in the future valuation sensitivity arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aig calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur as recent experience demonstrates actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the capital markets super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses on average prices for cdos increased during 2011 further it is difficult to extrapolate future experience based on current market conditions for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability out of the total 6 2 billion net notional amount of cds written on multi sector cdos outstanding at march 31 2011 a bet value is available for 3 8 billion net notional amount no bet value is determined for 2 4 billion of cds written on european multi sector cdos as prices on the underlying securities held by the cdos are not provided by collateral managers instead these cds are valued using counterparty prices therefore sensitivities disclosed below apply only to the net notional amount of 3 8 billion the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the estimated price of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual price of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the price used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities while the models attempt to predict changes in the prices of underlying collateral securities held within a cdo the changes are subject to actual market conditions which have proved to be highly volatile especially given current market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo at this time 170 table of contents american international group inc and subsidiaries the following table presents key inputs used in the bet model
