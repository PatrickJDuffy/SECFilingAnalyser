group inc and subsidiaries consideration of aigs ability to continue as a going concern in connection with the preparation of its third quarter form 10 q management has assessed whether aig has the ability to continue as a going concern in making this assessment aig has considered data table removed each of these items is discussed in more detail below in considering these items management has made significant judgments and estimates with respect to the potentially adverse financial and liquidity effects of aigs risks and uncertainties management has also assessed other items and risks arising in aigs businesses and made reasonable judgments and estimates with respect thereto after consideration management believes that it will have adequate liquidity to finance and operate aigs businesses and continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months it is possible that the actual outcome of one or more of managements plans could be materially different or that one or more of managements significant judgments or estimates about the potential effects of the risks and uncertainties could be prove to be materially incorrect or that the principal transactions disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements and as discussed below do not result in completed transactions if one or more of these possible outcomes were realized aig may not have sufficient cash to meet its obligations if aig needs funds in excess of amounts available from the sources described below aig would need to find additional financing and if such additional financing were to be unavailable there could be substantial doubt about aigs ability to continue as a going concern liquidity events leading up to september 22 2008 liquidity entering the third quarter aig parent entered the third quarter of 2008 with 17 6 billion of cash and cash equivalents including the remaining proceeds from the issuance of 20 billion of common stock equity units and junior subordinated debt securities in may 2008 in addition aigs securities lending collateral pool held 10 4 billion of cash and other short term investments on august 18 2008 aig raised 3 25 billion through the issuance of 8 25 percent notes due 2018 strategic review and proposed liquidity measures from mid july and throughout august 2008 aigs then chief executive officer robert willumstad was engaged in a review of aigs businesses mr willumstad had announced that he would hold an investor meeting on september 25 2008 to present the results of his review during this same time period aig was engaged in a review of measures to address the liquidity concerns in aigs securities lending portfolio discussed in previous sec filings and to address the ongoing collateral calls with respect to aigfps super senior multi sector credit default swap portfolio to facilitate this process aig asked a number of investment banking firms to discuss possible solutions to these issues in late august aig engaged j p morgan securities inc j p morgan to assist in developing alternatives including a potential additional capital raise continuing liquidity pressures under aigs securities lending program cash collateral is received from borrowers and invested by aig primarily in fixed maturity securities to earn a spread historically aig had received cash collateral from borrowers of 100 102 percent of the value of the loaned securities in light of more favorable terms offered by other lenders of securities aig accepted cash advanced by borrowers of less than the 102 percent historically required by insurance regulators under an agreement with its insurance company subsidiaries participating in the securities lending program aig parent deposited collateral in an amount sufficient to address the deficit aig parent also deposited amounts into the collateral pool to offset losses realized by the pool in connection with sales of impaired securities aggregate deposits by aig parent to or for the benefit of the securities lending collateral pool through august 31 2008 totaled 3 3 billion in addition from july 1 2008 to august 31 2008 the continuing decline in value of the super senior collateralized debt obligations cdo securities protected by aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio together with ratings downgrades of such cdo securities resulted in aigfp posting or agreeing to post collateral in an aggregate net amount of 6 0 billion by the beginning of september 2008 these collateral postings and securities lending requirements were placing increasing stress on aig parents liquidity rating agencies in early september 2008 aig met with the representatives of the principal rating agencies to discuss mr willumstads 49 american international group inc and subsidiaries strategic review as well as the liquidity issues arising from aigs securities lending program and aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio on friday september 12 2008 s and p placed aig on creditwatch with negative implications and noted that upon completion of its review the agency could affirm aig parents current rating of aa or lower the rating by one to three notches aig understood that both s and p and moodys would re evaluate aigs ratings early in the week of september 15 2008 also on friday september 12 2008 aigs subsidiaries ilfc and agf were unable to replace all of their maturing commercial paper with new issuances of commercial paper as a result aig advanced loans to these subsidiaries to meet their commercial paper obligations the accelerated capital raise attempt as a result of s and ps action aig accelerated the process of attempting to raise additional capital and over the weekend of september 13 and 14 2008 discussed potential capital injections and other liquidity measures with private equity firms sovereign wealth funds and other potential investors aig kept the united states treasury and the ny fed informed of these efforts aig also engaged blackstone advisory services lp to assist in developing alternatives including a potential additional capital raise despite offering a number of different structures through this process aig did not receive a proposal it could act upon in a timely fashion aigs difficulty in this regard resulted in part from the dramatic decline in its common stock price from 22 76 on september 8 2008 to 12 14 on september 12 2008 this decrease in stock price made it unlikely that aig would be able to raise the large amounts of capital that would be necessary if aigs long term debt rating were downgraded aig attempts to enter into a syndicated secured lending facility on monday september 15 2008 aig was again unable to access the commercial paper market for its primary commercial paper programs aig funding ilfc and agf payments under the programs totaled 2 2 billion for the day and aig advanced loans to ilfc and agf to meet their funding obligations in addition aig experienced returns under its securities lending programs which led to cash payments of 5 2 billion to securities lending counterparties on that day on monday morning september 15 2008 aig met with representatives of goldman sachs and co j p morgan and the ny fed to discuss the creation of a 75 billion secured lending facility to be syndicated among a number of large financial institutions the facility was intended to act as a bridge loan to meet aig parents liquidity needs until aig could sell sufficient assets to stabilize and enhance its liquidity position goldman sachs and co and j p morgan immediately began the syndication attempt the rating agencies downgrade aigs long term debt rating in the late afternoon of september 15 2008 s and p downgraded aigs long term debt rating by three notches moodys downgraded aigs long term debt rating by two notches and fitch downgraded aigs long term debt rating by two notches as a consequence of the rating actions aigfp estimated that it would need in excess of 20 billion in order to fund additional collateral demands and transaction termination payments in a short period of time subsequently in a period of approximately 15 days following the rating actions aigfp was required to fund approximately 32 billion reflecting not only the effect of the rating actions but also changes in market levels and other factors the private sector solution fails by tuesday morning september 16 2008 it had become apparent that goldman sachs and co and j p morgan were unable to syndicate a lending facility moreover the downgrades combined with a steep drop in aigs common stock price to 4 76 on september 15 2008 had resulted in counterparties withholding payments from aig and refusing to transact with aig even on a secured short term basis as a result aig was unable to borrow in the short term lending markets to provide liquidity on tuesday september 16 2008 both ilfc and agf drew down on their revolving credit facilities resulting in borrowings of approximately 6 5 billion and 4 6 billion respectively also on september 16 2008 aig was notified by its insurance regulators that it would no longer be permitted to borrow funds from its insurance company subsidiaries under a revolving credit facility that aig had maintained with certain of its insurance subsidiaries acting as lenders subsequently the insurance regulators required aig to repay any outstanding loans under that facility and to terminate it the intercompany facility was terminated effective september 22 2008 fed credit agreement by early tuesday afternoon on september 16 2008 it was clear that aig had no viable private sector solution to its liquidity crisis at this point aig received the terms of a secured lending agreement that the ny fed was prepared to provide aig estimated that it had an immediate need for cash in excess of its available liquid resources that night aigs board of directors approved borrowing from the ny fed based on a term sheet that set forth the terms of the secured credit agreement and related equity participation over the next six days aig elected edward m liddy director chairman and ceo replacing robert willumstad in those positions and negotiated a definitive credit agreement with the ny fed and borrowed on a secured basis approximately 50 american international group inc and subsidiaries 37

rmbs llc up to 1 billion plus the amount of capitalized interest thereon after the loans have returned amounts equal to their principal and capitalized interest payments with respect to the remaining rmbs received by the rmbs llc will be allocated as contingent interest on both of the loans there are no economic interests in the rmbs llc other than the ny feds senior loan and aigs subordinated loan the implementation of rmbs llc is subject to the approval of the relevant state insurance commissioners terminations of multi sector credit default swap transactions aigfp currently has outstanding multi sector credit default swaps with third party counterparties related to cdos such credit default swaps require that aigfp post collateral with the counterparties to secure its obligations based on fair value deterioration ratings downgrades of referenced obligations and downgrades of aigs ratings as of november 5 2008 aigfp had either agreed to post or posted collateral based on exposures calculated in respect of super senior credit default swaps in an aggregate net amount of 37 3 billion 52 american international group inc and subsidiaries aig and the ny fed expect

credit default swaps aigfp and the ny fed have begun negotiating the terminations depending on the level of counterparty participation on the closing date the ny fed will advance up to 30 billion the tranche a loan and aig will advance up to 5 billion the tranche b loan to the cdo llc to fund the purchase price of such cdos separately aig will pay the costs associated with the unwind of the

and capitalized interest payments with respect to the remaining cdos received by the cdo llc will be allocated as contingent interest on both of the loans there are no economic interests in the cdo llc other than the tranche a loan and tranche b loan because the successful implementation of the proposed establishment of the cdo llc depends on the agreement of the counterparties to terminate their super senior credit default swaps no assurance can be given that this facility will be completed or if completed on the level of participation commercial paper funding facility on october 27 2008 four aig affiliates applied for participation in the ny feds commercial paper funding facility cpff aig funding inc ilfc curzon funding llc and nightingale finance llc may issue up to

restructuring officer to oversee the asset disposition plan and has developed a plan to sell assets and businesses to repay the fed facility aig intends to retain the majority of its u s property and casualty and foreign general insurance businesses and to retain an ownership interest in certain of its foreign life insurance operations aig is exploring divestiture opportunities for its remaining

liquidity events as a result of aigs deteriorated financial condition and its announced strategies aigs businesses have been subjected to strained relationships with customers brokers agents other business partners and employees as well as increased monitoring by regulatory agencies specific issues related to aigs businesses are addressed below general insurance while the commercial insurance group cig has been generally successful in retaining clients the amount of business aig underwrites for clients has declined concern over aigs 53 american international group inc and subsidiaries financial strength has a particularly adverse effect on cig underwriting of directors and officers insurance especially at the higher attachment points new business activity has been at lower levels and aig continues to see pricing pressure in its general insurance business the domestic property and casualty companies are beneficiaries of 5 7 billion of letters of credit arranged by aig and its subsidiaries letters of credit totaling 4 2 billion will expire on december 31 2008 and the remainder will expire on december 31 2010 these letters of credit secure amounts recoverable from both affiliated and unaffiliated reinsurers the inability of aig to renew or replace these letters of credit or otherwise obtain equivalent financial support from aig or a third party would result in a significant reduction of the statutory surplus of these property and casualty insurance companies aig is pursuing alternatives to letters of credit such as trust agreements and other forms of credit support and is also pursuing opportunities to significantly reduce the need for such security after december 31 2008 capital maintenance aig has capital maintenance agreements with the companies included in the commercial insurance and mortgage guaranty reporting units under which aig may be required to provide ongoing capital support life insurance and retirement services disruptions in markets throughout the world and aigs recent liquidity issues have had and aig expects will continue to have a significant adverse effect on life insurance and retirement services operating results specifically its net investment income deferred policy acquisition costs dac and sales inducement asset sia amortization and net realized capital losses in 2008 aig expects that these events and aigs previously announced asset disposition plan will continue to be key factors in the remainder of 2008 and into 2009 in addition aig parents liquidity issues have affected certain operations through higher surrender activity particularly in the u s domestic retirement services fixed annuity business and foreign investment oriented and retirement services products in japan and asia for japan and korea surrenders are expected to continue to be higher than historic averages in the next quarter and possibly beyond due to the suspension of sales by some banks equity market volatility and elevated levels of surrenders while surrender levels have declined from their peaks in mid september they are still higher than historic levels and aig expects them to remain at these higher than historic levels until the uncertainties relating to aig are resolved these uncertainties together with rating agency downgrades have resulted in reduced levels of new sales activity particularly among products and markets where ratings are critical sales of investment oriented and retirement services products in japan and asia have also declined new sales activity is expected to remain at lower levels until the uncertainties relating to aig are resolved due to the high volume of surrender activity for certain investment oriented products in the u k surrender payments were temporarily suspended in accordance with contract terms to provide time to develop an appropriate course of action with the respective distribution network and to protect the interests of the funds policyholders during the three months ended september 30 2008 and through october 29 2008 aig contributed capital totaling 16 6 billion 11 8 billion of which was contributed using borrowings under the fed facility to certain of its domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services subsidiaries to replace a portion of the capital lost as a result of net realized capital losses further capital contributions will be required to the extent additional net realized capital losses are incurred in taiwan aig expects to contribute approximately 1 4 billion to nan shan in november 2008 as a result of the continued declines in the taiwan equity market aig made capital contributions of 1 3 billion to support foreign life operations in hong kong and japan principally due to the steep decline in aigs common stock price additional capital contributions to certain operations may be necessary during the remainder of 2008 in large measure due to the continued effect of equity market volatility declining bond prices and net realized capital losses resulting from other than temporary impairment charges financial services international lease finance corporation as a result of aig parents liquidity issues and related credit rating downgrades ilfc was unable to borrow in the public short term and long term debt markets and therefore ilfc borrowed 6 5 billion under its credit facilities in september 2008 ilfc expects to use these borrowings to repay maturing commercial paper and other obligations aig expects that ilfc may raise additional funds through secured lending transactions in early 2009 ilfc can also issue commercial paper under the cpff ilfc believes that these borrowings and cash from operations which may include aircraft sales will permit ilfc to meet its obligations through september 2009 after which aig would rely upon additional asset sales and funding through the fed facility capital markets given the extreme market conditions during the third quarter of 2008 downgrades of aigs credit ratings by the rating agencies as well as aigs intention to refocus on its core business aigfp began unwinding certain of its businesses and portfolios aig is only entering into new derivative transactions to maintain its current portfolio reduce risk and hedge 54 american international group inc and subsidiaries the currency and interest rate risks associated with its affiliated businesses aig is also opportunistically terminating contracts due to the long term duration of aigfps derivative contracts and the complexity of aigfps portfolio aig expects that an orderly wind down will take a substantial period of time american general finance as a result of aig parents liquidity issues and the related credit ratings downgrades agf suspended its efforts to borrow in the public short term and long term debt markets as a result agf borrowed approximately 4 6 billion under its primary credit facilities in september 2008 agf anticipates that its primary sources of funds to support its operations and repay its obligations will be finance receivable collections from operations and secured financings which will require it to limit its lending activities and focus on expense savings agf anticipates that its existing sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its debt and other obligations through the first quarter of 2009 agf will need additional sources of funds at that time including sales of agf assets and funding through the fed facility aig consumer finance group aigs recent liquidity issues and related credit ratings downgrades have materially adversely affected aig consumer finance group inc aigcfg aigcfg experienced significant deposit withdrawals in hong kong during september 2008 the inability of aigcfg to access its traditional sources of funding resulted in aig lending 1 6 billion to subsidiaries of aigcfg in september and october of 2008 aig expects that these businesses will continue to be materially adversely affected until the current uncertainties concerning aig and the potential sale of these businesses are resolved asset management the principal cash requirements in asset management are to fund warehousing activities existing capital commitments and certain direct investments general disruption in the global equity and credit markets and the liquidity issues at aig have negatively affected the institutional asset management segment operating results distressed global markets have reduced the value of assets under management translating to lower base management fees and reduced performance fees carried interest tight credit markets have put pressure on the commercial and residential real estate markets which has caused values in certain geographic locations to fall resulting in impairment charges on real estate held for investment purposes aig parents liquidity issues and lower asset performance as a result of challenging market conditions have contributed to the loss of institutional and retail clients as well as higher redemptions from some of aigs managed hedge and mutual funds the continued uncertainty in the equity and credit markets as well as aig parents liquidity issues and the proposed asset dispositions will continue to adversely affect management and performance fees as well as aigs ability to launch new funds and investment strategies within the spread based investment business distressed markets have resulted in significant loss of invested asset value and aig expects such losses to continue through the remainder of 2008 in addition given market conditions aig does not expect to issue any additional debt to fund the mip for the foreseeable future other effects as disclosed in its 2007 annual report on form 10 k aig expected to contribute approximately 118 million to its u s and non u s pension plans in 2008 for the nine months ended september 30 2008 aig had contributed 122 million to its u s and non u s pension plans based upon the current funded status of the plans the current interest rate environment and the projected performance of pension plan assets additional expected contributions for the u s and non u s pension plans in the 2008 fourth quarter range from approximately 168 million to 532 million actual contributions however will depend on asset performance foreign exchange rates and the interest rate environment as of december 31 2008 actual contributions may also vary as a result of anticipated dispositions regulators in various jurisdictions in which aig entities operate have imposed additional requirements on the aig entities these requirements primarily require aig to obtain prior approval from the regulator for transactions related to the dispositions of assets transfers of cash or other transactions outside the normal course of business in addition certain regulators have requested additional capital or collateral to be posted to date these requirements have not had a significant effect on aigs operations aig conducted an annual goodwill impairment review as of june 30 2008 in connection with the decline in the price of aigs common stock during the third quarter of 2008 aig conducted an updated goodwill impairment test as of september 30 2008 as a result of the updated test aig recognized goodwill impairment charges of 432 million for the three month period ended september 30 2008 which were primarily related to the domestic consumer finance and the capital markets businesses in addition the excess of the fair value over the carrying value of aigs personal lines and foreign consumer finance businesses narrowed subsequent to the june 30 2008 test as of september 30 2008 goodwill related to these businesses totaled approximately 700 million and 344 million respectively a continuation of the decline in fair value of these 55 american international group inc and subsidiaries businesses could result in impairment of goodwill in the future risk factors the following supplements the significant factors that may affect aigs business and operations described under risk factors in item 1a of part i of aigs 2007 annual report on form 10 k business and credit environment aigs businesses results of operations and financial condition have been materially and adversely affected by recent market conditions during the third quarter of 2008 continuing through november 2008 worldwide economic conditions significantly deteriorated the decline in economic conditions has resulted in highly volatile markets a steep decline in equity markets further and continuing lack of liquidity a widening of credit spreads a lack of price transparency and the collapse of several prominent financial institutions global regulators and central banks have taken a number of unprecedented steps to address these issues but it is unclear whether these measures will be effective or if effective when the markets will stabilize aig has been materially and adversely affected by these conditions and events in a number of ways including data table removed the consequences of these conditions have been more severe for aig than for other insurers aig expects its businesses financial condition and results of operations will continue to be materially and adversely affected by these conditions for the foreseeable future aig is subject to extensive litigation that may have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or its consolidated results of operations as described in note 7 a to the consolidated financial statements aig is subject to extensive litigation including securities class actions due to the nature of this litigation the lack of precise damage claims and the type of claims made against aig aig cannot currently quantify its ultimate liability for these actions it is possible that such liability could have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period credit and financial strength ratings adverse ratings actions regarding aigs long term debt ratings by moodys or s and p would require aig to make additional substantial collateral payments under existing derivative transactions to which aigfp is a party which could adversely affect aigs business and its consolidated results of operations and financial condition on september 15 2008 the following credit rating

actions aigfp estimated that it would need in excess of 20 billion in order to fund additional collateral demands and transaction termination payments in a short period of time subsequently in a period of approximately 15 days following the rating actions aigfp was required to fund approximately 32 billion reflecting not only the effect of the rating actions but also changes in market levels

senior unsecured debt ratings to baa1 from a3 most ratings remain under review for possible downgrade with ilfc revised to under review with direction uncertain credit ratings measure a companys ability to repay its obligations and directly affect the cost and availability to that company of unsecured financing in the event of a further downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings aig would be required to post additional collateral and aig or its counterparties would be permitted to elect early termination of contracts it is estimated that as of the close of business on october 27 2008 based on aigfps outstanding municipal gias and financial derivative transactions at that date a downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings to baa1 by moodys and bbb by s and p would permit counterparties to make additional calls and permit either aig or the counterparties to elect early termination of contracts resulting in up to approximately 5 2 billion of collateral and termination payments while a downgrade to baa2 by moodys and bbb by s and p would result in approximately 0 3 billion in additional collateral and termination payments for the multi sector super senior credit default swap portfolio it is estimated based on the october 24 2008 notional values a downgrade of aigs long term senior debt ratings to baa1 by moodys and bbb by s and p would increase the amount of collateral posted by approximately 2 7 billion due to the adjustment of threshold and independent amount percentages a downgrade to baa2 by moodys and bbb by s and p would allow the counterparties to certain 2a7 puts to elect early termination resulting in a cash outflow of approximately 3 7 billion in addition at that rating level counterparties to transactions representing approximately 47 8 billion in net notional amount have the right to elect early termination in the event a counterparty elects to terminate a transaction early such transaction will be terminated at its replacement value less any previously posted collateral due to current market conditions it is not possible to reliably estimate the replacement cost of these transactions the actual amount of collateral that aigfp would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades or the aggregate amount of payments that aig could be required to make depends on market conditions the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade additional obligations to post collateral or the costs of assignment repayment or alternative credit could exceed the amounts available under the fed credit agreement see discussion of the fed credit agreement below a downgrade in the short term credit ratings of the commercial paper programs of certain aig affiliates could make these issuers ineligible for participation in the ny feds commercial paper funding facility cpff aigs affiliates aig funding inc ilfc curzon funding llc and nightingale

holders and policyholders help maintain public confidence in a companys products facilitate marketing of products and enhance a companys competitive position further downgrades of the insurer financial strength ratings of aigs insurance companies may prevent these 57 american international group inc and subsidiaries companies from offering products and services or result in increased policy cancellations or termination of assumed reinsurance contracts moreover a downgrade in aigs credit ratings may under credit rating agency policies concerning the relationship between a parents

require aig to devote significant resources to debt repayment and preferred dividends for the foreseeable future thereby reducing capital available for other purposes aig is required to repay the fed credit agreement primarily from the proceeds of sales of assets including businesses these mandatory repayments permanently reduce the amount available under the fed credit agreement in addition american general finance inc agf and ilfc have drawn the full amounts available under their revolving credit facilities and currently do not have access to their traditional sources of long term or short term financing through the public debt markets unanticipated collateral calls continued high surrenders a downgrade in aigs credit ratings or a further deterioration in aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio may cause aig to need additional funding in excess of the borrowings available under the fed credit agreement if aig needs funds in excess of those available under the fed credit agreement aig will need to find additional financing further an inability to effect asset sales in accordance with its asset disposition plan may result in aig not being able to timely repay its borrowings under the fed credit agreement see also significant liquidity requirements asset disposition plan for a discussion of aigs asset disposition plan the series d preferred shares pay a 10 percent dividend which will not be deductible for tax purposes aigs substantial obligations will require it to dedicate all of its proceeds from asset sales and a considerable portion of its cash flows from operations to the repayment of the fed facility thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes in addition because aigs debt service and preferred dividend obligations will be very high aig may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures and expects to have less flexibility to plan for or respond to changing business and economic conditions borrowings under the fed credit agreement are subject to the ny fed being satisfied with the collateral pledged by aig a condition to borrowing under the fed credit agreement is that the ny fed be satisfied with the collateral pledged by aig including its value it is possible that the ny fed may determine that aigs collateral is insufficient to permit a borrowing for many reasons including data table removed such a determination could limit aigs ability to borrow under the fed facility aig must sell significant assets to service the debt under the fed credit agreement aig must make asset sales to repay the borrowings under the fed credit agreement a delay or inability to effect these sales at acceptable prices and terms could result in aig being unable to repay the fed credit agreement by its maturity date while aig has adopted an asset disposition plan as discussed under significant liquidity requirements this plan may not be successfully executed due to among other things data table removed further due to aigs need to dispose of assets aig may be unable to negotiate favorable terms if aig is not able to execute its disposition plan and cannot otherwise repay the fed facility in accordance with its terms an event of default would result if an event of default were to occur the ny fed could among other things declare outstanding borrowings under the fed facility immediately due and payable in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under the fed credit agreement could also result in an event of default under other agreements the fed credit agreement includes financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on aigs financial and business operations the fed credit agreement requires aig to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity level and restricts aigs ability to make certain capital expenditures if the ny fed objects thereto in addition the fed credit agreement restricts aigs and its restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness incur liens merge consolidate sell assets enter into hedging transactions outside the normal course of business or pay dividends these covenants could restrict aigs business and thereby adversely affect aigs results of operations 58 american international group inc and subsidiaries moreover if aig fails to comply with the covenants in the fed credit agreement and is unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result if an event of default were to occur the ny fed could among other things declare outstanding borrowings under the fed credit agreement immediately due and payable in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under the fed credit agreement could also result in an event of default under other agreements aigs results of operations will be materially adversely affected by a significant increase in interest expense aig expects its results of operations in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in 2009 to be significantly adversely affected by the recognition of interest expense aigs initial 1 7 billion commitment fee will amortize over the term of the fed facility finally the prepaid commitment fee asset of 23 billion associated with the preferred stock to be issued will be amortized through interest expense over the term of the fed facility as a result aig anticipates that interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in the year ended december 31 2009 will significantly increase as a result of these items in addition paid in kind interest expense under the fed facility is accrued over the term of the fed facility liquidity aigs businesses have been adversely affected by aigs reduced liquidity many of aigs businesses depend upon the financial stability both actual and perceived of aig parent perceptions that aig or its subsidiaries may not be able to meet their obligations can negatively affect aigs businesses in many ways including requests by customers to withdraw funds from aig under annuity and certain life insurance contracts a refusal by independent agents brokers and banks to continue to offer aig products and services a refusal of customers or vendors to continue to do business with aig and requests by customers and other parties to terminate existing contractual relationships aigs ability to access funds from its subsidiaries is limited as a holding company aig depends on dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments on aigs obligations including its debt securities in light of aigs current financial situation aig expects that its regulated subsidiaries may be significantly restricted from making dividend payments or advancing funds to aig this restriction may hinder aigs ability to access funds that aig may need to make payments on its obligations including those arising from day to day business activities controlling shareholder as a result of the issuance of the series c preferred stock aig will be controlled by a trust holding the series c preferred stock for the benefit of the united states treasury aigs interests and those of aigs minority shareholders may not be the same as those of the united states treasury in accordance with the fed credit agreement aig will issue 100 000 shares of series c perpetual convertible participating preferred stock the series c preferred stock to a trust that will hold the series c preferred stock for the benefit of the united states treasury the trust pursuant to the agreement in principle reached by aig and the ny fed on november 9 2008 to amend the ny fed credit agreement the series c preferred stock is entitled to participate in any dividends paid on the common stock with the payments attributable to the series c preferred stock being approximately but not in excess of 77 9 percent of the aggregate dividends paid on aigs common stock treating the series c preferred stock as converted and to the extent permitted by law vote with aigs common stock on all matters submitted to aigs shareholders and hold approximately but not in excess of 77 9 percent of the aggregate voting power of the common stock treating the series c preferred stock as converted the series c preferred stock will remain outstanding even if the fed facility is repaid in full or otherwise terminates in addition upon shareholder approval to certain amendments to aigs certificate of incorporation the trust can convert the series c preferred stock into aig common stock as a result of its ownership the trust will be able to elect all of aigs directors and can control the vote on all matters including data table removed moreover the trusts ability to prevent an unsolicited bid for aig or any other change in control could also have an adverse effect on the market price of aigs common stock 59 american international group inc and subsidiaries the trust may also transfer the series c preferred stock to another person or entity and that person or entity may become aigs controlling shareholder possible future sales of series c preferred stock or aig common stock by the trust could adversely affect the market for aig common stock aig has agreed to file a shelf registration statement that will allow the trust to sell series c preferred stock or any shares of common stock it receives upon conversion of the preferred stock in addition the trust could sell series c preferred stock or shares of aig common stock without registration under certain circumstances such as in a private transaction although aig can make no prediction as to the effect if any that such sales would have on the market price of aig common stock sales of substantial amounts of series c preferred stock or aig common stock or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of aig common stock if the trust sells or transfers shares of series c preferred stock or aig common stock as a block another person or entity could become aigs controlling shareholder employees the decline in aigs common stock price and the announcement of proposed asset dispositions may prevent aig from retaining key personnel aig relies upon the knowledge and talent of its employees to successfully conduct business the decline in aigs common stock price has dramatically reduced the value of equity awards previously granted to its key employees in addition the announcement of proposed asset dispositions may result in competitors seeking to hire aigs key employees aig has implemented retention programs to seek to keep its key employees but there can be no assurance that the programs will be effective a loss of key personnel could reduce the value of aigs businesses and impair its ability to effect a successful asset disposition plan change of

allowance to reduce tax benefits on capital losses to the amount that aig believes is more likely than not to be realized the effective tax rate on the pre tax loss for the nine month period ended

the effective tax rates on pre tax income for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2007 were 30 0 percent and 28 0 percent respectively these effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rate due primarily to benefits from remediation adjustments and the recognition of tax benefits associated with the sico plan for which the compensation expense was recognized in prior years realization of the deferred tax asset depends on aigs ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward periods of the jurisdictions in which the net operating losses and deductible temporary differences were incurred aig assessed its ability to realize the deferred tax asset of 19 1 billion and concluded a 3 3 billion valuation allowance was

differences future gaap taxable income and tax planning strategies aig would implement if necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset in assessing future gaap taxable income aig considered its strong earnings history exclusive of the recent losses on the super senior credit default swap portfolio and from the securities lending program with respect to which aig is entering into transactions with the ny fed to limit exposure to future losses aig also considered taxable income from the sales of businesses under its asset disposition plan the continuing earnings strength of the insurance

the worsening market conditions during the last several quarters ugc has tightened underwriting standards and increased premium rates for its first and second lien business as the credit markets tightened the second lien business has seen a significant decline in activity and combined with ugcs tightened underwriting standards new business written for second liens has dropped significantly as a result of the decline in new business and in conjunction with the increasing loss experience ugc decided to withdraw from the second lien market cease selling new business and place its second lien portfolio into run off as of september 30 2008 mortgage guarantys operating loss increased significantly in the three month period ended september 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to tightening credit markets declining housing values and the recognition of a premium deficiency reserve on second lien business net premiums written declined by 8 percent to 280 million in the three month period ended september 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to declines in private student loans and international mortgage businesses of 77 percent and 30 percent respectively primarily due to tightened underwriting standards first and second lien business grew moderately due to increased persistency year over year however new insurance written which is a measure of the amount of new insurance added to the portfolio during the three month period ended september 30 2008 decreased 77 percent and 97 percent respectively when compared to the same period in 2007 this decline is primarily due to ugcs tightening of underwriting guidelines and rate increases during the period losses and loss expenses incurred increased 461 million over the same period in 2007 driven by domestic first and second lien business due to the continuing decline in the domestic housing market domestic first and second lien losses incurred increased 189 percent and 35 percent

compared to 197 0 in the same period in 2007 limits on certain ceded reinsurance covering the domestic first lien business may result in increased net losses in future periods if the current housing market decline continues historically mortgage guaranty included all mortgage insurance risks in a single premium deficiency test because the manner of acquiring servicing and measuring the profitability of all mortgage guaranty contracts was consistent with the decision to place the second lien business in run off management no longer measures the profitability for the second lien business in the same manner as that for mortgage guarantys ongoing businesses and will no longer report loss ratio or expense ratio information for the second lien business as a result ugc performed a separate premium deficiency calculation for the second lien business as of september 30 2008 at september 30 2008 the present value of expected second lien future losses and expenses net of expected future recoveries was 1 6 billion offset by the present value of expected second lien future premium of 499 million and the already established loss reserves of 727 million resulting in a premium deficiency reserve of 453 million the second lien risk in force at september 30 2008 totaled 3 1 billion with 550 thousand second lien policies in force expected to run off over the next 10 to 12 years risk in force represents the full amount of second lien loans insured reduced for contractual aggregate loss limits on certain pools of loans usually 10 percent of the full amount of loans insured in each pool mortgage guaranty may record net losses on this business in future periods because the timing of future delinquencies may precede recognition of future premiums in an amount in

lines of business on a statutory annual statement basis data table removed presented by lines of business pursuant to statutory reporting requirements as prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners aigs gross reserve for losses and loss expenses represents the accumulation of estimates of ultimate losses including estimates for incurred but not yet reported reserves ibnr and loss expenses the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated any adjustments resulting therefrom are currently reflected in operating income because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development estimates for mortgage guaranty insurance losses and loss adjustment expense reserves are based on notices of mortgage loan delinquencies and estimates of delinquencies that have been incurred but have not been reported by loan servicers based upon historical reporting trends mortgage guaranty establishes reserves using a percentage of the contractual liability for each delinquent loan reported that is based upon past experience regarding certain loan factors such as age of the delinquency cure rates dollar amount of the loan and type of mortgage loan because mortgage delinquencies and claims payments are affected primarily by macroeconomic events such as changes in home price appreciation or depreciation interest rates and unemployment the determination of the ultimate loss cost requires a high degree of judgment aig believes it has provided appropriate reserves for currently delinquent loans consistent with industry practice aig does not establish a reserve for insured loans that are not currently delinquent but that may become delinquent in future periods at

expenses as of september 30 2008 while aig regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves there can be no assurance that aigs ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed aigs loss reserves as of september 30 2008 in the opinion of management such adverse development and resulting increase in reserves is not likely to have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated financial condition although it could have a material adverse effect on aigs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period 74 american international group inc and subsidiaries the reconciliation of net loss reserves was as follows data table removed the following tables summarize development favorable or unfavorable of incurred losses and loss expenses for prior years other than accretion of discount data table removed data table removed in determining the quarterly loss development from prior accident years aig conducts analyses to determine the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year for each profit center for example if loss emergence for a profit center is different than expected for certain accident years the actuaries examine the indicated effect such emergence would have on the reserves of that profit center in some cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in no clear change in the ultimate loss estimate for the accident years in question and no adjustment would be made to the profit centers reserves for prior accident years in other cases the higher or lower than expected emergence may result in a larger change either favorable or unfavorable than the difference between the actual and expected loss emergence such additional analyses were conducted for each profit center as appropriate in the three month period ended september 30 2008 to determine the loss development from prior accident years for the three month period ended september 30 2008 as part of its quarterly reserving process aig also considers notices of claims received with respect to emerging issues such as those related to the u s mortgage and housing market 2008 net loss development in the three

accident years 2002 and prior asbestos and environmental reserves the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability as described more fully in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k aigs reserves relating to asbestos and environmental claims reflect a comprehensive ground up analysis in the nine month period ended september 30 2008 aig maintained the ultimate loss estimates for asbestos and environmental claims resulting from the recently completed reserve analyses a minor amount of adverse incurred loss development pertaining to asbestos was reflected in the nine month period ended september 30 2008 as presented in the table that follows this development was primarily attributable to several large defendants the effect of which was largely offset by one large favorable settlement a moderate amount of favorable gross incurred loss development pertaining to environmental was reflected in the nine month period ended september 30 2008 as presented in the table that follows this development was primarily attributable to recent favorable experience which was fully reinsured resulting in no favorable net development on environmental net reserves 77 american international group inc and subsidiaries a summary of reserve activity including estimates for applicable ibnr relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined appears in the following table the vast majority of such claims arise from policies written in 1984 and prior years the current environmental policies that aig underwrites on a claims made basis have been excluded from the following table data table removed a gross amounts were revised from the presentation in prior periods to reflect the inclusion of certain reserves not previously identified as asbestos and environmental related this

for losses and loss expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were estimated as follows data table removed gross amounts were revised from the presentation in prior periods to reflect the inclusion of certain reserves not previously identified as asbestos and environmental related this revision had no effect on net reserves a summary of asbestos and environmental claims count activity was as follows data table removed survival ratios asbestos and environmental the following table presents aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims at september 30 2008 and 2007 the survival ratio is derived by dividing the current carried loss reserve by the average payments for the three most recent calendar years for these claims therefore the survival ratio is a simplistic measure estimating the number of years it would be before the current ending loss reserves for these claims would be paid off using recent year average payments the september 30 2008 survival ratio is lower than the ratio at september 30 2007 because the more recent periods included in the rolling average reflect higher claims payments in addition aigs survival ratio for asbestos claims was negatively affected by the favorable settlement described above as well as several similar settlements during 2007 these settlements reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at 78 american international group inc and subsidiaries september 30 2008 by approximately 1 2 years and 2 7 years respectively and reduced gross and net asbestos survival ratios at september 30 2007 by approximately 1 4 years and 3 2 years respectively many factors such as aggressive settlement procedures mix of business and level of coverage provided have a significant effect on the amount of asbestos and environmental reserves and payments and the resultant survival ratio moreover as discussed above the primary basis for aigs determination of its reserves is not survival ratios but instead the ground up and top down analysis thus caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy for these claims based simply on this survival ratio aigs survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims separately and combined were based upon a three year average payment these ratios at september 30 2008 and 2007 were as follows data table removed gross amounts for 2007 were revised from the presentation in prior periods to reflect the inclusion of certain reserves not previously identified as asbestos and environmental related this revision had no

losses generally reflect the trends in equity markets principally in japan and asia the higher net realized capital losses in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2008 compared to the

addition to the higher net realized capital losses and lower net investment income noted above the operating loss for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2008 increased as a result of

higher surrender activity resulting from aig parents liquidity issues beginning in mid september the operating loss also included higher benefit costs in the japan variable life level premium product

insurance and retirement services results was the change in measurement of fair value for embedded policy derivatives the pre tax effect of adoption related to embedded policy derivatives was an increase in net realized capital losses of 155 million as of january 1 2008 partially offset by a 47 million dac benefit related to these losses the effect of initial adoption was primarily due to an increase in the embedded policy derivative liability valuations resulting from the inclusion of explicit risk margins aig adopted fas 159 on january 1 2008 and elected to apply the fair value option

effects of the adoption of fas 157 further described below foreign life insurance and retirement services net realized capital losses were significantly higher in the nine months ended september 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the increased other than temporary impairment charges were primarily driven by severity losses credit events and the change in aigs intent and ability to hold

than temporarily impaired in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2008 the domestic life insurance and domestic retirement services operations incurred higher net realized capital

gains losses the corresponding gain or loss with respect to the economically hedged bond is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the bond is sold matures or is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired the most significant effect of aigs adoption of fas 157 was the change in measurement of fair value for embedded policy derivatives the pre tax effect of adoption related to embedded policy derivatives was an increase in net realized capital losses of 155 million as of january 1 2008 the effect of initial adoption was primarily due to an increase in the embedded policy derivative liability valuations resulting from the inclusion of explicit risk margins deferred policy acquisition costs and sales inducement assets dac for life insurance and retirement services products arises from the deferral of costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new or renewal business policy acquisition costs for life insurance

and sales inducement costs increased 284 million in the nine month period ended september 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to higher production in the foreign life insurance operations and domestic retirement services total amortization expense increased by 540 million in the nine month period ended september 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the current year amortization includes a 957 million increase to operating income related to net realized capital losses in the first nine months of 2008 compared to 170 million in the same period of 2007 reflecting significantly higher other than temporary impairment charges current year amortization for domestic retirement services also includes adjustments for dac and sia charges of 354 million related to the continued weakness in the equity markets dac and sia charges of 71 million due to higher surrender activity in september 2008 and dac and sia charges of 199 million related to expected future higher surrender activity there was no effect from higher surrender activity in domestic life and the foreign life operations as the write off of the dac was 96 american international group inc and

further deferral or amortization of dac and sia for that product the amounts of dac and sia written off as of january 1 2008 were 1 1 billion and 299 million respectively the major components of the changes in dac voba and sia were as follows data table removed in 2008 primarily represents the cumulative effect of adoption of fas 159 in 2007 primarily represents the cumulative effect of adoption of sop 05 1 as aig operates in various global markets the estimated gross profits used to amortize dac voba and sia are subject to differing market returns and interest rate environments in any single period the combination of market returns and interest rates may lead to acceleration of amortization in some products and regions and simultaneous deceleration of amortization in other products and regions 97 american international group inc and subsidiaries dac voba and sia for insurance oriented investment oriented and retirement services products are reviewed for recoverability which involves estimating the future profitability of current business this review involves significant management judgment if actual future profitability is substantially lower than estimated aigs dac voba and sia may be subject to an impairment charge and aigs results of operations could be significantly affected in future periods future policy benefit reserves periodically the net benefit reserves policy benefit reserves less dac established for life insurance and retirement services companies are tested to ensure that including consideration of future expected premium payments they are adequate to provide for future policyholder benefit obligations the assumptions used to perform the tests are current best estimate assumptions as to policyholder mortality morbidity terminations company maintenance expenses and invested asset returns for long duration traditional business a lock in principle applies whereby the assumptions used to calculate the benefit reserves and dac are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience these assumptions include margins for adverse deviation in the event that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions for business in force outside of north america 47 percent of total policyholder benefit liabilities at september 30 2008 represent traditional business where the lock in principle applies in most foreign locations various guarantees are embedded in policies in force that may remain applicable for many decades into the future as experience changes over time the best estimate assumptions are updated to reflect observed changes because of the long term nature of many of aigs liabilities subject to the lock in principle small changes in certain of the assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy in particular changes in estimates of future invested asset return assumptions have a large effect on the degree of reserve adequacy taiwan beginning in 2000 the yield available on taiwanese 10 year government bonds dropped from approximately 6 percent to 2 5 percent at september 30 2008 yields on most other invested assets have correspondingly dropped over the same period current sales are focused on products such as data table removed in developing the reserve adequacy analysis for nan shan several key best estimate assumptions have been made observed historical mortality improvement trends have been projected to 2014 morbidity expense and termination rates have been updated to reflect recent experience taiwan government bond rates are expected to remain at current levels for 10 years and gradually increase to best estimate assumptions of a market consensus view of long term interest rate expectations foreign assets are assumed to comprise 35 percent of invested assets resulting in a composite long term investment assumption of approximately 4 9 percent and the current practice permitted in taiwan of offsetting positive mortality experience with negative interest margins thus eliminating the need for mortality dividends will continue future results of the reserve adequacy tests will involve significant management judgment as to mortality morbidity expense and termination rates and investment yields adverse changes in these assumptions could accelerate dac amortization and necessitate reserve strengthening the ability to maintain the current investment strategy is uncertain due to the recent significant declines in the taiwan equity markets and the related effect on capital solvency and potential actions by the taiwan regulators future results of the reserve adequacy tests will be affected by the nature timing and duration of any potential change in investment strategy implemented for nan shan financial services

september 30 2008 respectively and 352 million for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2007 the remaining operating loss resulted from the change in credit spreads on aigfps other assets and liabilities and a decline in operating income for agf agfs operating income declined in the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2008 compared to the same periods in 2007 primarily due to increases in the provision for finance receivable losses and goodwill impairment in addition agf recorded a pre tax charge of 27 million in second quarter 2008 resulting from agfs

wide variety of financial transactions including standard and customized financial products involving commodities credit currencies energy equities and rates the credit products include credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt securities aigfp has also invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and principal investments and engaged in borrowing activities involving the issuance of standard and structured notes and other securities and entering into gias given the extreme market conditions experienced during the third quarter of 2008 downgrades of aigs credit ratings by the rating agencies as well as aigs intent to refocus on its core businesses aigfp began unwinding its businesses and portfolios historically aigs capital markets operations derived a significant portion of their revenues from hedged financial positions entered into in connection with counterparty transactions aigfp has also participated as a dealer in a wide variety of financial derivatives transactions revenues and operating income of the capital markets operations and the percentage change in these amounts for any given period are significantly affected by changes in the fair value of aigfps assets and liabilities and by the number size and profitability of transactions entered into during that period relative to those entered into during the comparative period aigfps products generally require sophisticated models and significant management assumptions to determine fair values and particularly during times of market disruption the absence of observable market data can result in fair values at any given balance sheet date that are not indicative of the ultimate settlement values of the products quarterly capital markets results capital markets reported an operating loss in the three month period ended september 30 2008 compared to operating income in the same period of 2007 primarily due to a 7 1 billion unrealized market valuation loss related to aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio principally written on multi sector cdos and credit valuation adjustments on aigfps assets and liabilities during 2008 aigfp instituted a number of measures to attempt to manage its liquidity in light of the deteriorating credit markets and its limited ability to access the capital markets these measures ultimately were unsuccessful these issues coupled with concerns regarding aigs resulting financial condition and the subsequent downgrade of its ratings by rating agencies on september 15 2008 have severely affected aigfps non credit businesses resulting in a significant decline in revenue aigfp has not replaced revenues from certain structured transactions that were terminated or matured at the end of 2007 and early 2008 the change in fair value of aigfps credit default swaps was caused by the significant widening in spreads and the downgrades of rmbs and cdo securities by rating agencies in the three month period ended september 30 2008 driven 100 american international group inc and subsidiaries by the credit concerns resulting from u s residential mortgages and the severe liquidity crisis affecting the markets see critical accounting estimates valuation of level 3 assets and liabilities during the third quarter of 2008 aigfp purchased super senior cdo securities with a net notional amount of 5 7 billion in connection with 2a 7 puts upon purchase 4 1 billion of these securities were included in aigfps trading securities portfolio and 1 6 billion of the securities were included in the available for sale portfolio at their fair value effective january 1 2008 and until august 2008 aigfp elected to apply the fair value option to all of its investment securities in august 2008 aigfp revised this election and now evaluates whether to elect the fair value option on a case by case basis for securities purchased in connection with the existing structured transaction approximately 840 million of the cumulative unrealized market valuation loss previously recognized on these derivatives was realized as a result of these purchases capital markets operating loss for the three month period ended september 30 2008 includes a net loss of 987 million representing the effect of changes in credit spreads on the valuation of aigfps assets and liabilities including 98 million of gains reflected in the unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps historically aigs credit spreads and those on its assets moved in a similar fashion this relationship began to diverge during second quarter of 2008 and the divergence continued through the third quarter while aigs credit spreads widened significantly more than the credit spreads on the abs and cdo products which represent a significant portion of aigfps investment portfolio the losses on aigfps assets more than offset the net gain on its liabilities which were driven by the significant widening in aigs credit spreads the net gain on aigfps liabilities was reduced by the effect of posting collateral and the early terminations of gias the following table presents aigfps credit valuation adjustment gains losses for the three month period ended september 30 2008 excluding intercompany transactions data table removed includes super senior credit default swap portfolio during the third quarter of 2008 aigfp recognized a gain of 450 million on a sale of its interest in a private equity investment to a consolidated affiliate of aig which is eliminated in consolidation this gain was partially offset by a 322 million loss recorded under the equity method of accounting reflecting aigfps share of a goodwill impairment charge recognized by this private equity investment in the third quarter of 2008 during 2008 aigfps revenues from certain products have declined in part as a consequence of the continued disruption in the credit markets the general decline in liquidity in the marketplace and aigfps efforts to manage its liquidity the most significant component of capital markets operating expenses is compensation due to the significant losses recognized by aigfp during 2008 the entire amount of 563 million accrued under aigfps various deferred compensation plans and special incentive plan was reversed in the third quarter of 2008 in the first quarter of 2008 aigfp established an employee retention plan which guarantees a broad group of aigfps employees and consultants a minimum level of compensation for each of the 2008 and 2009 compensation years subject to mandatory partial deferral which in certain circumstances will be indexed to the price of aig stock the expense related to the retention plan is being recognized over the vesting period beginning in the first quarter of 2008 year to date capital markets results capital markets reported an increased operating loss in the nine month period ended september 30 2008 compared to the operating loss in the same period of 2007 primarily due to 21 7 billion in unrealized market valuation losses related to aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio principally written on multi sector cdos and credit valuation adjustments on aigfps assets and liabilities financial market conditions in the nine month period ended september 30 2008 were characterized by widening credit spreads and declining interest rates during the second quarter of 2008 aigfp implemented further refinements to the cash flow waterfall used by the bet model and the assumptions used therein these refinements reflected the ability of a cdo to use principal proceeds to cover interest payment obligations on lower rated tranches the ability of a cdo to use principal proceeds to cure a breach of an over collateralization test the ability of a cdo to amortize certain senior cdo tranches on a pro rata or sequential basis and the preferential payment of management fees to the extent there is a lag in the prices provided by the collateral managers aig refines those prices by rolling them forward to the end of the quarter using prices provided by a third party pricing service the net effect of these refinements was an incremental unrealized market valuation loss of 342 million refinements made during the third quarter of 2008 had only a de minimis effect on the unrealized market valuation loss 101 american international group inc and subsidiaries during the second quarter of 2008 aigfp issued new 2a 7 puts with a net notional amount of 5 4 billion on the super senior security issued by a cdo of aaa rated commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs pursuant to a facility that was entered into in 2005 at this time aigfp is not party to any commitments to enter into any new 2a 7 puts during the nine month period ended september 30 2008 aigfp extinguished its obligations with respect to a credit default swap by purchasing the protected cdo security for 103 million its principal amount outstanding related to this obligation additionally aigfp purchased other super senior cdo securities with a net notional amount of 6 6 billion in connection with 2a 7 puts upon purchase 5 0 billion of these securities were included in aigfps trading portfolio and 1 6 billion in available for sale portfolio at their fair value approximately 907 million of the cumulative unrealized market valuation loss previously recognized on these derivatives was realized as a result of these purchases the net loss recognized for the nine month period ended september 30 2007 included a 166 million reduction in fair value of certain derivatives that are an integral part of and economically hedge the structured transactions potentially affected by the proposed guidance by the united states department of the treasury affecting the ability to claim foreign tax credits effective january 1 2008 aigfp adopted fas 157 the most significant effect of adopting fas 157 was a change in the valuation methodologies for hybrid financial instruments and derivative liabilities both freestanding and embedded historically carried at fair value the changes were primarily to incorporate aigfps own credit risk when appropriate in the fair value measurements effective january 1 2008 aigfp elected to apply the fair value option under fas 159 to all eligible assets and liabilities other than equity method investments trade receivables and trade payables because electing the fair value option allows aigfp to more closely align its earnings with the economics of its transactions by recognizing concurrently through earnings the change in fair value of its derivatives and the offsetting change in fair value of the assets and liabilities being hedged as well as the manner in which the business is evaluated by management in august 2008 aigfp prospectively modified this election as management believes it is appropriate to exclude the automatic election of

unrealized market valuation loss on super senior credit default swaps historically aigs credit spreads and those on its assets moved in a similar fashion this relationship began to diverge during second quarter of 2008 and continued to diverge through the third quarter while aigs credit spreads widened significantly more than the credit spreads on the abs and cdo products which represent a significant portion of aigfps investment portfolio the losses on aigfps assets more than offset the net gain on its liabilities which were driven by the significant widening in aigs credit spreads the

receivables from equity one inc on february 29 2008 the increase in the net finance receivables resulted in an increase in revenues generated from these assets partially offset by the reduced

higher net mark to market losses of 135 million related to credit default swap investments the mip invests in credit default swaps comprised predominantly of single name high grade corporate exposures

month period ended september 30 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 due to significantly higher returns in the 2007 period and weaker market conditions in 2008 also contributing to the decline was the one time distribution from a single partnership of 164 million in the nine month period ended september 30 2007 offsetting these declines were foreign exchange gains on foreign denominated gic reserves which increased by 694 million in the nine month period ended september 30 2008 as a result of the strengthening of the u s dollar compared to the 2007 period and an increase in net mark to

partially effective in hedging the interest rate and foreign exchange risk aig has not applied hedge accounting treatment the mip recognized higher operating income in the nine months ended september 30 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 due to higher net interest income due to a larger average asset base the effect of lower funding costs related to interest rate swaps on debt not receiving

management recorded an operating loss for the three month period ended september 30 2008 compared to operating income in the same period in 2007 this negative variance was driven by impairment losses on proprietary real estate investments of 102 million a decrease of 36 million in securities lending revenues a decrease of 22 million in net carried interest revenues and lower trading gains on market making activities at aig private bank also contributing to the decline were net mark to market losses on economic interest rate swap hedges associated with warehouse investments net mark to

december 31 2007 and september 30 2007 respectively the decline from december 31 2007 reflects lower asset values due to the significant deterioration in the credit and equity markets during 2008 as

security is considered a candidate for other than temporary impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant 25 percent or more discount to par amortized cost if lower or cost for an extended period of time nine consecutive months or longer the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims or aig may not realize a full recovery on its investment regardless of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer its near term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances the above criteria also consider circumstances of a rapid and severe market valuation decline such as that experienced in current credit markets in which aig could not reasonably assert that the impairment period would be temporary severity losses for further discussion see invested assets portfolio review other than temporary impairments at each balance sheet date aig evaluates its securities holdings with unrealized losses when aig does not intend to hold such securities until they have recovered their cost basis aig records the unrealized loss in income if a loss is recognized from a sale subsequent to a balance sheet date pursuant to changes in circumstances the loss is recognized in the period in which the intent to hold the securities to recovery no longer existed in periods subsequent to the recognition of an other than

future taxable income aig records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount aig believes is more likely than not to be realized at each balance sheet date existing assessments are reviewed and if necessary revised to reflect changed circumstances income taxes on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in connection with aigs asset disposition plan aig determined it can no longer assert that earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested due to the complexity of the u s federal income tax laws involved in determining the amount of income taxes incurred on these potential dispositions as well as aigs reliance on reasonable assumptions and estimates in calculating this liability aig considers the u s federal income taxes accrued on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be a critical accounting estimate fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities overview aig measures at fair value on a recurring basis financial instruments in its trading and available for sale securities portfolios certain mortgage and other loans receivable certain spot commodities derivative assets and liabilities securities purchased sold under agreements to resell repurchase securities lending invested collateral non marketable equity investments included in other invested assets certain policyholders contract deposits securities and spot commodities sold but not yet purchased certain trust deposits and deposits due to banks and other depositors certain long term borrowings and certain hybrid financial instruments included in other liabilities the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing able and knowledgeable market participants at the measurement date the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value conversely financial instruments traded in other than active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment an active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability being valued occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis an other than active market is one in which there are few transactions the prices are not current price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers or in which little information is released publicly for the asset or liability being valued pricing observability is affected by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions aig management is responsible for the determination of the value of the financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions with respect to securities aig employs independent third party valuation service providers to gather analyze and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments when aigs valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote which is generally non binding or by employing widely accepted internal valuation models valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and through the use of widely accepted internal valuation models provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of service agreements the inputs used by the valuation service providers include but are not limited to market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities interest rate yield curves credit spreads currency rates and other market observable information as applicable the valuation models take into account among other things market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term interest rate credit rating industry sector and when applicable collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information when market transactions or other market observable data is limited

broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency when models are used the selection of a particular model to value an otc derivative depends on the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market aig generally uses similar models to value similar instruments

otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets such as generic forwards swaps and options model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means and model selection does not involve significant management judgment certain otc derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information and the determination of fair value for these

euro general contractual terms aigfp entered into credit default swap and other credit derivative transactions collectively cds in the ordinary course of its business in the majority of aigfps credit derivatives transactions aigfp sold credit protection on a designated portfolio of loans or debt securities generally aigfp provides such credit protection on a second loss basis meaning that aigfp will incur credit losses only after a shortfall of principal and or interest or other credit events in respect of the protected loans and debt securities exceed a specified threshold amount or level of first loss typically the credit risk associated with a designated portfolio of loans or securities has been tranched into different layers of risk which are then analyzed and rated by the credit rating agencies at origination there is usually an equity layer covering the first credit losses in respect of the portfolio up to a specified percentage of the total portfolio and then successive layers ranging from generally a bbb rated layer to one or more aaa rated layers a significant majority of transactions that are rated by rating agencies have risk layers or tranches that were rated aaa at origination and are immediately junior to the threshold level above which aigfps payment obligation would generally arise in transactions that were not rated aigfp applied equivalent risk criteria for setting the threshold level for its payment obligations therefore the risk layer assumed by aigfp with respect to the designated portfolio of loans or securities in these transactions is often called the super senior risk layer defined as a layer of credit risk senior to one or more risk layers that have been rated aaa by the credit rating agencies or if the transaction is not rated structured to the equivalent thereto 114 american international group inc and subsidiaries the following graphic represents a typical structure of a transaction including the super senior risk layer

shortfalls bankruptcy and certain other events such as write downs of the value of underlying assets as further described below by contrast under the large majority of cds transactions in respect of multi sector cdos comprising approximately 57 billion or 46 5 percent of the net notional amount for the arbitrage portfolio at september 30 2008 aigfps payment obligations are triggered by the occurrence of a non payment event under a single reference cdo security and performance is limited to a single payment by aigfp in return for physical delivery by the counterparty of the reference security see physical settlement below a number of cds transactions in respect of clos have similar settlement mechanisms in addition the arbitrage portfolio includes transactions with a net notional amount of 4 9 billion that allow holders to put securities to aigfp at par in the event of a failed remarketing of the referenced security aigfp cannot currently determine if and when it may be required to perform its obligations in the future including the timing of any future triggering events or the amount of any additional purchases individually or in the aggregate that might be required physical settlement for cds transactions requiring physical settlement aigfp is required to pay unpaid principal and accrued interest for the relevant reference obligation in return for physical delivery of such reference obligation by the cds buyer upon the occurrence of a credit event after purchasing the reference obligation aigfp may sell the security and recover all or a portion of the purchase price paid under the cds or hold such security and be entitled to receive subsequent collections of principal and interest there can be no assurance that the satisfaction of these obligations by aigfp will not have a material effect on aigs liquidity aigfp generally is required to settle such a transaction only if the following conditions are satisfied a credit event as defined in the relevant cds transaction confirmation must have occurred in all cds transactions subject to physical settlement failure to pay is specified as a credit event and is generally triggered if there is a failure by the issuer under the related cdo to make a payment under the reference obligation after the expiration of any applicable grace period and in certain transactions subject to a nominal non payment threshold having been met in addition certain of the aigfp cdss with an aggregate net notional amount totaling 7 7 billion provide credit protection in respect of cdos that require minimum amounts of collateral to be maintained to support the cdo debt where the value of such collateral is affected by among other things the ratings of the securities and other obligations comprising such collateral in the event that the issuer of such a cdo fails to maintain the minimum levels of collateral an event of default would occur triggering a right by a specified controlling class of cdo note holders to accelerate the payment of principal and interest on the protected reference obligations under certain of the cdss upon acceleration of the reference obligations underlying a cds aigfp may be required to purchase such reference obligations for a purchase price equal to unpaid principal and accrued interest of the cdo in settlement of the cds as a result of this over collaterization feature of these cdos aigfp potentially may be required to purchase such cdo securities in settlement of the related cds sooner than it would be required to if such cdos did not have an over collaterization feature as of november 5 2008 eight cdos for which aigfp had written credit protection on the super senior layer had experienced over collaterization related events of default one of these cdos was accelerated in the second quarter of 2008 and aigfp extinguished a portion of its cds obligations by purchasing the protected cdo security for 103 million which equaled the principal amount 116 american international group inc and subsidiaries outstanding related to this cds aigfp extinguished the remainder of its cds obligations related to this cdo on november 6 2008 by purchasing the protected cdo security for 59 million which equaled the remaining principal amount of this cdo security subject to cds protection aigfps remaining cds net notional exposure with respect to cdos that have experienced over collateralization events of default was 2 4 billion at november 5 2008 while aigfp believes that these defaulted transactions are most likely to result in a payment by aigfp aig cannot estimate the timing of any required payments since the timing of a credit event may be outside of aigfps control in addition certain of aigfps cdss provide credit protection in respect of cdos that provide if the cdo issuer fails to pay amounts due on classes of cdo securities that rank pari passu with or subordinate to such referenced obligations an event of default would occur triggering a right by a specified controlling class of cdo noteholders to accelerate the payment of principal and interest on the protected reference obligations as in the case of cdos with the over collateralization feature the existence of such an acceleration feature potentially may result in aigfp being required to purchase the super senior reference obligation in settlement of the related cds sooner than would be required if such cdo did not have such acceleration feature the cds buyer must deliver the reference obligation within a specified period generally within 30 days there is no payment obligation if delivery is not made within this period upon completion of the physical delivery and payment by aigfp aigfp would be the holder of the relevant reference obligation and have all rights associated with a holder of such securities cash settlement transactions requiring cash settlement also known as pay as you go are in respect of protected baskets of reference credits which may also include single name cdss in addition to securities and loans rather than a single reference obligation as in the case of the physically settled transactions described above under these credit default swaps each time a triggering event occurs a loss amount is calculated a triggering event is generally a failure by the relevant obligor to pay principal of or in some cases interest on one of the reference credits in the underlying protected basket triggering events may also include bankruptcy of reference credits write downs or postponements with respect to interest or to the principal amount of a reference credit payable at maturity the determination of the loss amount is specific to each triggering event it can represent the amount of a shortfall in ordinary course interest payments on the reference credit a write down in the interest on or principal of such reference credit or any amount postponed in respect thereof it can also represent the difference between the notional or par amount of such reference credit and its market value as determined by reference to market quotations triggering events can occur multiple times either as a result of continuing shortfalls in interest or write downs or postponements on a single reference credit or as a result of triggering events in respect of different reference credits included in a protected basket in connection with each triggering event aigfp is required to make a cash payment to the buyer of protection under the related cds only if the aggregate loss amounts calculated in respect of such triggering event and all prior triggering events exceed a specified threshold amount reflecting aigfps attachment point in addition aigfp is typically entitled to receive amounts recovered or deemed recovered in respect of loss amounts resulting from triggering events caused by interest shortfalls postponements or write downs on reference credits to the extent that there are reimbursements received actual or deemed by the cds buyer in respect of prior triggering events aigfp will be entitled to receive equivalent amounts from the counterparty to the extent aigfp has previously made a related payment 2a 7 puts included in the multi sector cdo portfolio are maturity shortening puts with a net notional amount of 4 9 billion as of september 30 2008 that allow the holders of the securities issued by certain cdos to treat the securities as short term eligible 2a 7 investments under the investment company act of 1940 2a 7 puts the general terms of these transactions differ from those referenced above holders of securities are required in certain circumstances to tender their securities to the issuers at par if an issuers remarketing agent is unable to resell the securities so tendered aigfp must purchase the securities at par as long as the security has not experienced a payment default or certain bankruptcy events with respect to the issuer of such security have not occurred during the nine month period ended september 30 2008 aigfp repurchased securities with a principal amount of approximately 6 6 billion in connection with these obligations of which 5 4 billion were funded using existing liquidity facilities aigfp repurchased securities with a principal amount of approximately 1 4 billion from september 30 2008 to october 27 2008 which were funded using existing liquidity facilities aigfp expects to repurchase within the next two years the majority of securities under the remaining 2a 7 puts having a net notional exposure of 3 5 billion at october 27 2008 in certain transactions aigfp has contracted with third parties to provide liquidity for the purchase of such securities if they are put to aigfp for up to a three year period such unused liquidity facilities 117 american international group inc and subsidiaries totaled 1 7 billion at october 27 2008 aig expects to use these facilities to fund future purchases of these securities termination events a majority of the super senior credit default swaps written on multi sector cdos provide the counterparties with an additional termination right once aigs rating level falls to bbb or baa at that level counterparties have the right to terminate the transactions early this aggregate net notional amount of such super senior credit default swaps written on multi sector cdos is approximately 47 8 billion as of october 27 2008 if counterparties exercise this right the contracts provide for the counterparties to be compensated for the cost to replace the trades or an amount reasonably determined in good faith to estimate the losses the counterparties would incur as a result of the termination of the trades many of the super senior credit default swaps written for regulatory capital relief having a net notional amount of 130 billion include triggers that require certain actions to be taken by aig upon such a downgrade which if not taken will give rise to a right of the counterparties to terminate the swaps such actions include posting collateral transferring the swap or providing a guarantee from a more highly rated entity through october 27 2008 aigfp has elected to post collateral in such cases and as a result the counterparty has not had the right to terminate the swaps given the level of uncertainty in estimating both the number of counterparties who may elect to exercise their right to terminate and the payment that may be triggered in connection with any such exercise aig is unable to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount that it would be required to pay under the super senior credit default swaps in the event of any such downgrade collateral most of aigfps credit default swaps are subject to collateral posting provisions these provisions differ among counterparties and asset classes although aigfp has collateral posting obligations associated with both regulatory capital relief transactions and arbitrage transactions the large majority of these obligations are associated with arbitrage transactions in respect of multi sector cdos the collateral arrangements in respect of the multi sector cdo regulatory capital and corporate arbitrage transactions are nearly all documented under a credit support annex csa to an international swaps and derivatives association inc isda master agreement master agreement the master agreement and csa forms are standardized form agreements published by the isda which market participants have adopted as the primary contractual framework for various kinds of derivatives transactions including cds the master agreement and csa forms are designed to be customized by counterparties to accommodate their particular requirements for the anticipated types of swap transactions to be entered into elective provisions and modifications of the standard terms are negotiated in connection with the execution of these documents the master agreement and csa permit any provision contained in these documents to be further varied or overridden by the individual transaction confirmations providing flexibility to tailor provisions to accommodate the requirements of any particular transaction a csa if agreed by the parties to a master agreement supplements and forms part of the master agreement and contains provisions among others for the valuation of the covered transactions the delivery and release of collateral the types of acceptable collateral the grant of a security interest in the case of a csa governed by new york law or the outright transfer of title in the case in a csa governed by english law in the collateral that is posted the calculation of the amount of collateral required the valuation of the collateral provided the timing of any collateral demand or return dispute mechanisms and various other rights remedies and duties of the parties with respect to the collateral provided in general each party has the right under a csa to act as the valuation agent and initiate the calculation of the exposure of one party to the other exposure in respect of transactions covered by the csa the valuation calculation may be performed daily weekly or at some other interval and the frequency is one of the terms negotiated at the time the csa is signed the definition of exposure under a standard csa is the amount that would be payable to one party by the other party upon a hypothetical termination of that transaction this amount is determined in most cases by the valuation agent using its estimate of mid market quotations i e the average of hypothetical bid and ask quotations of the amounts that would be paid for a replacement transaction aigfp determines exposure typically by reference to the mark to market valuation of the relevant transaction produced by its systems and specialized models exposure amounts are typically determined for all transactions under a master agreement unless the parties have specifically agreed to exclude certain transactions not to apply the csa or to set a specific transaction exposure to zero the aggregate exposure less the value of collateral already held by the relevant party and following application of certain thresholds results in a net exposure amount delivery amount if this amount is a positive number then the other party must deliver collateral with a value equal to the delivery amount under the standard csa the party not acting as valuation agent for any particular exposure calculation may dispute the valuation agents calculation of the delivery amount if the parties are unable to resolve this dispute the terms of the standard csa provide that the valuation agent is required to recalculate exposure using in substitution for the disputed exposure amounts the average of actual quotations at mid market from four leading dealers in the relevant market 118 american international group inc and subsidiaries regulatory capital transactions as of september 30 2008 approximately 27 percent of aigfps regulatory capital transactions measured by net notional amount were subject to a csa in other transactions which represent approximately 39 percent of the total net notional amount of the outstanding regulatory capital transactions aigfp is obligated to put a csa or alternative collateral arrangement in place if aigs ratings fall below certain levels typically aa aa3 in light of the rating actions taken in respect of aig on september 15 2008 aigfp has implemented a csa or alternative collateral arrangement in a large majority of these transactions in some cases aigfp may not reach agreement with a counterparty on the terms of a collateral arrangement and as a result the counterparty may be entitled to terminate the transaction in general each regulatory capital transaction is subject to a stand alone master agreement or similar agreement which means that aggregate exposure for the given master agreement or similar agreement is calculated only with reference to a single transaction there are diverse mechanisms for calculating exposure in these transactions a small minority relies on the standard csa approach described above under collateral the large majority uses a formula to calculate exposure in most cases the formula is unique to that transaction or counterparty these unique formulas typically depend on either credit ratings including the ratings of aig and in some cases the ratings of notes that have been issued with respect to different tranches of the transaction rating agency expected loss models or changes in spreads on identified credit indices but do not depend on the value of any underlying reference obligations arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos in the large majority of the cds transactions in respect of multi sector cdos the standard csa provisions for the calculation of exposure have been modified with the exposure amount determined pursuant to an agreed formula that is based on the difference between the net notional amount of such transaction and the market value of the relevant underlying cdo security rather than the replacement value of the transaction in cases where a formula is utilized a transaction specific threshold is generally factored into the calculation of exposure which reduces the amount of collateral required to be posted these thresholds typically vary based on the credit ratings of aig and or the reference obligations with greater posting obligations arising in the context of lower ratings for the large majority of counterparties to these transactions the master agreement and csa cover non cds transactions e g interest rate and cross currency swap transactions as well as cds transactions arbitrage portfolio corporate debt clos almost all of aigfps corporate arbitrage transactions are subject to csas approximately 47 percent measured by net notional amount of these transactions contain no special collateral posting provisions but are subject to a master agreement that includes a csa these transactions are treated the same as other trades subject to the same master agreement and csa with the calculation of collateral in accordance with the standard csa procedures outlined above approximately 53 percent measured by net notional amount of these transactions although subject to a master agreement and csa have specific valuation and threshold provisions these thresholds are typically based on a combination of the credit rating of aig and a moodys model rating of the transaction and not based on the value of any underlying reference obligations thus as long as aig maintains a rating above a specified threshold and the moodys model of the underlying transaction exceeds a specified rating the collateral provisions do not apply collateral calls aigfp has received collateral calls from counterparties in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps of which a large majority relate to multi sector cdos to a significantly lesser extent aigfp has also received collateral calls in respect of certain super senior credit default swaps entered into by counterparties for regulatory capital relief purposes and in respect of corporate debt clos frequently valuation estimates made by counterparties with respect to certain super senior credit default swaps or the underlying reference cdo securities for purposes of determining the amount of collateral required to be posted by aigfp in connection with such instruments have differed at times significantly from aigfps estimates in almost all cases aigfp has been able to successfully resolve the differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements due to the ongoing nature of these collateral calls aigfp may engage in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of these differences at any time as of september 30 2008 aigfp had either agreed to post or posted collateral based on exposures calculated in respect of super senior credit default swaps in an aggregate net amount of 32 8 billion valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes were like any other third party valuation considered in the determination of the fair value estimates of aigfps super senior credit default swap portfolio through june 30 2007 aigfp had not received any collateral calls related to this credit default swap portfolio since that date and through october 27 2008 counterparties have made large collateral calls against aigfp in particular related to the multi sector cdo portfolio this was largely driven by deterioration in the market value of the reference obligations as of july 31 2008 aigfp had either agreed to 119 american international group inc and subsidiaries post or posted collateral based on exposures calculated in respect of super senior credit default swaps in an aggregate net amount of 16 5 billion since that date and up to november 5 2008 aig has agreed to post or posted an additional 23 4 billion for a total of 39 9 billion resulting from continued deterioration in the market valuation of the referenced obligations rating downgrades of reference obligations and the downgrade of aigs ratings the amount of future collateral posting requirements is a function of aigs credit ratings the rating of the reference obligations and any further decline in the market value of the relevant reference obligations with the latter being the most significant factor given the severe market disruption lack of observable data and the uncertainty regarding the potential effects on market prices of the tarp and other measures recently undertaken by the federal government to address the credit market disruption aigfp is unable to reasonably estimate the amounts of collateral that it would be required to post the maximum amount of collateral that aigfp could be required to post is the net notional amount of the super senior credit default swap portfolio models and modeling aigfp values its credit default swaps written on the most senior super senior risk layers of designated pools of debt securities or loans using internal valuation models third party prices and market indices the principal market was determined to be the market in which super senior credit default swaps of this type and size would be transacted or have been transacted with the greatest volume or level of activity aig has determined that the principal market participants therefore would consist of other large financial institutions who participate in sophisticated over the counter derivatives markets the specific valuation methodologies vary based on the nature of the referenced obligations and availability of market prices the valuation of the super senior credit derivatives continues to be challenging given the limitation on the availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in the structured finance market particularly during and since the fourth quarter of 2007 these market conditions have increased the reliance on management estimates and judgments in arriving at an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes further disparities in the valuation methodologies employed by market participants and the varying judgments reached by such participants when assessing volatile markets have increased the likelihood that the various parties to these instruments may arrive at significantly different estimates as to their fair values aigfps valuation methodologies for the super senior credit default swap portfolio have evolved in response to the deteriorating market conditions and the lack of sufficient market observable information aig has sought to calibrate the model to available market information and to review the assumptions of the model on a regular basis arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos the underlying assumption of the valuation methodology for aigfps credit default swap portfolio wrapping multi sector cdos is that to be willing to assume the obligations under a credit default swap a market participant would require payment of the full difference between the cash price of the underlying tranches of the referenced securities portfolio and the net notional amount specified in the credit default swap aigfp uses a modified version of the binomial expansion technique bet model to value its credit default swap portfolio written on super senior tranches of cdos of abs including the 2a 7 puts the bet model was developed in 1996 by a major rating agency to generate expected loss estimates for cdo tranches and derive a credit rating for those tranches and has been widely used ever since aig selected the bet model for the following reasons data table removed the bet model has certain limitations a well known limitation of the bet model is that it can understate the expected losses for super senior tranches when default correlations are high the model uses correlations implied from diversity scores which do not capture the tendency for correlations to increase as defaults increase recognizing this concern aig tested the sensitivity of the valuations to the diversity scores the results of the testing demonstrated that the valuations are not very sensitive to the diversity scores because the expected losses generated from the prices of the collateral pool securities are currently high breaching the attachment point in most transactions once the attachment point is breached by a sufficient amount the diversity scores and their implied correlations are no longer a significant driver of the valuation of a super senior tranche aigfp has adapted the bet model to estimate the price of the super senior risk layer or tranche of the cdo aig modified the bet model to imply default probabilities from market prices for the underlying securities and not from rating agency assumptions to generate the estimate the model uses the prices for the securities comprising the portfolio of a cdo as an input and converts those prices to credit spreads over current libor based interest rates these credit spreads are used to determine implied probabilities of default and 120 american international group inc and subsidiaries expected losses on the underlying securities this data is then aggregated and used to estimate the expected cash flows of the super senior tranche of the cdo the application of the modified bet model involves the following steps for each individual super senior tranche of a cdo in the portfolio 1 calculation of the cash flow pattern that matches the weighted average life for each underlying security of the cdo 2 calculation of an implied credit spread for each security from the price and cash flow pattern determined in step 1 this is an arithmetic process which converts prices to yields similar to the conversion of united states treasury security prices to yields and then subtracts libor based interest rates to determine the credit spreads 3 conversion of the credit spread into its implied probability of default this also is an arithmetic process that determines the assumed level of default on the security that would equate the present value of the expected cash flows discounted at a risk free rate with the present value of the contractual cash flows discounted using libor based interest rates plus the credit spreads 4 generation of expected losses for each underlying security using the probability of default and recovery rate 5 aggregation of the cash flows for all securities to create a cash flow profile of the entire collateral pool within the cdo 6 division of the collateral pool into a number of hypothetical independent identical securities based on the cdos diversity score so that the cash flow effects of the portfolio can be mathematically aggregated properly the purpose of dividing the collateral pool into hypothetical securities is a simplifying assumption used in all bet models as part of a statistical technique that aggregates large amounts of homogeneous data 7 simulation of the default behavior of the hypothetical securities using a monte carlo simulation and aggregation of the results to derive the effect of the expected losses on the cash flow pattern of the super senior tranche taking into account the cash flow diversion mechanism of the cdo 8 discounting of the expected cash flows determined in step 7 using libor based interest rates to estimate the value of the super senior tranche of the cdo and 9 adjustment of the model value for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap for the effect of the risk of non performance by aig using the credit spreads of aig available in the marketplace and considering the effects of collateral and master netting arrangements aigfp employs a monte carlo simulation in step 7 above to assist in quantifying the effect on the valuation of the cdo of the unique aspects of the cdos structure such as triggers that divert cash flows to the most senior part of the capital structure the monte carlo simulation is used to determine whether an underlying security defaults in a given simulation scenario and if it does the securitys implied random default time and expected loss this information is used to project cash flow streams and to determine the expected losses of the portfolio in addition to calculating an estimate of the fair value of the super senior cdo security referenced in the credit default swaps using its internal model aigfp also considers the price estimates for the super senior cdo securities provided by third parties including counterparties to these transactions to validate the results of the model and to determine the best available estimate of fair value in determining the fair value of the super senior cdo security referenced in the credit default swaps aigfp uses a consistent process which considers all available pricing data points and eliminates the use of outlying data points when pricing data points are within a reasonable range an averaging technique is applied the following table presents the net notional amount and fair value derivative liability of the multi sector super senior credit default swap portfolio using aigfps fair value methodology at september 30 2008 data table removed the fair value derivative liability of 30 2 billion recorded on aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio represents the cumulative change in fair value of these derivatives which represents aigs best estimate of the amount it would need to pay to a willing able and knowledgeable third party to assume the obligations under aigfps super senior multi sector credit default swap portfolio as of september 30 2008 arbitrage portfolio corporate debt clos the valuation of credit default swaps written on portfolios of investment grade corporate debt and clos is less complex than the valuation of super senior multi sector cdo credit default swaps and the valuation inputs are more transparent and readily available in the case of credit default swaps written on portfolios of investment grade corporate debt aigfp estimates the fair value of its obligations by comparing the contractual premium of each contract to the current market levels of the 121 american international group inc and subsidiaries senior tranches of comparable credit indices the itraxx index for european corporate issuances and the cdx index for u s corporate issuances these indices are considered reasonable proxies for the referenced portfolios in addition aigfp compares these valuations to third party prices and makes adjustments as necessary to determine the best available estimate of fair value aigfp estimates the fair value of its obligations resulting from credit default swaps written on clos to be equivalent to the par value less the current market value of the referenced obligation accordingly the value is determined by obtaining third party quotes on the underlying super senior tranches referenced under the credit default swap contract no assurance can be given that the fair value of aigfps arbitrage credit default swap portfolio would not change materially if other market indices or pricing sources were used to estimate the fair value of the portfolio regulatory capital portfolio in the case of credit default swaps written to facilitate regulatory capital relief aigfp estimates the fair value of these derivatives by considering observable market transactions the transactions with the most observability are the early terminations of these transactions by counterparties aig expects that the majority of these transactions will be terminated within the next 6 to 18 months by aigfps counterparties from january 1 2008 through september 30 2008 94 9 billion in net notional exposures have been terminated since that date and through october 27 2008 4 5 billion in net notional exposures have been terminated aigfp has not been required to make any payments as part of these terminations and in certain cases was paid a fee upon termination in all cases terminations were initiated by the counterparties prior to the transactions maturing aigfp also considers other market data to the extent relevant and available in light of early termination experience to date and after other analyses aig determined that there was no unrealized market valuation adjustment for this regulatory capital relief portfolio for the nine month period ended september 30 2008 other than for one transaction where aigfp believes the counterparty is no longer using the transaction to obtain regulatory capital relief during the second quarter of 2008 a regulatory capital relief transaction with a net notional amount of 1 6 billion and a fair value loss of 125 million was not terminated as expected when it no longer provided regulatory capital benefit to the counterparty this transaction provided protection on an rmbs unlike the other regulatory transactions which provide protection on loan portfolios held by the counterparties the documentation for this transaction contains provisions not included in aigfps other regulatory capital relief transactions which enable the counterparty to arbitrage a specific credit exposure aig will continue to assess the valuation of this portfolio and monitor developments in the marketplace given the significant deterioration in the credit markets and the risk that aigfps expectations with respect to the termination of these transactions by its counterparties may not materialize there can be no assurance that aig will not recognize unrealized market valuation losses from this portfolio in future periods and recognition of even a small percentage decline in the fair value of this portfolio could be material to aigs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period or to aigs consolidated financial condition key assumptions used in the bet model multi sector cdos the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the pricing of the individual securities within the cdo collateral pools the following table summarizes the gross transactional notional weighted average price at june 30 2008 and september 30 2008 by abs category data table removed the decrease in the weighted average prices reflects continued deterioration in the markets for rmbs and cmbs and further downgrades in rmbs and cmbs credit ratings prices for the individual securities held by a cdo are obtained in most cases from the cdo collateral managers to the extent available for the quarter ended september 30 2008 cdo collateral managers provided market prices for approximately 70 percent of the underlying securities when a price for an individual security is not provided by a cdo collateral manager aigfp derives the price through a pricing matrix using prices from cdo collateral managers for similar securities matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the relationship of the security to other benchmark quoted securities substantially all of the cdo collateral managers who provided prices used dealer prices for all or part of the underlying securities in some cases supplemented by third party pricing services the bet model also uses diversity scores weighted average lives recovery rates and discount rates the determination of some of these inputs requires the use of judgment 122 american international group inc and subsidiaries and estimates particularly in the absence of market observable data diversity scores which reflect default correlations between the underlying securities of a cdo are obtained from cdo trustees or implied from default correlations weighted average lives of the underlying securities are obtained when available from external subscription services such as bloomberg and intex and if not available aigfp utilizes an estimate reflecting known weighted average lives collateral recovery rates are obtained from the multi sector cdo recovery data of a major rating agency aigfp utilizes a libor based interest rate curve to derive its discount rates aigfp employs similar control processes to validate these model input as those used to value aigs investment portfolio as described in critical accounting estimates fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities overview the effects of the adjustments resulting from the validation process were de minimis for each period presented valuation sensitivity arbitrage portfolio multi sector cdos aig utilizes sensitivity analyses that estimate the effects of using alternative pricing and other key inputs on aigs calculation of the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio while aig believes that the ranges used in these analyses are reasonable given the current difficult market conditions aig is unable to predict which of the scenarios is most likely to occur actual results in any period are likely to vary perhaps materially from the modeled scenarios and there can be no assurance that the unrealized market valuation loss related to the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with any of the sensitivity analyses for the purposes of estimating sensitivities for the super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio the change in valuation derived using the bet model is used to estimate the change in the fair value of the derivative liability as mentioned above the most significant assumption used in the bet model is the pricing of the securities within the cdo collateral pools if the actual pricing of the securities within the collateral pools differs from the pricing used in estimating the fair value of the super senior credit default swap portfolio there is potential for material variation in the fair value estimate a decrease by five points for example from 87 cents per dollar to 82 cents per dollar in the aggregate price of the underlying collateral securities would increase the fair value derivative liability by approximately 3 7 billion while an increase in the aggregate price of the underlying collateral securities by five points for example from 90 cents per dollar to 95 cents per dollar would reduce the fair value derivative liability by approximately 3 8 billion any further declines in the value of the underlying collateral securities held by a cdo will similarly affect the value of the super senior cdo securities given their significantly depressed valuations given the current difficult market conditions aig cannot predict reasonably likely changes in the prices of the underlying collateral securities held within a cdo at this time the following table presents other key inputs used in the bet model and the potential increase decrease to the fair value of the derivative liability at september 30 2008 corresponding to changes in these key inputs data table removed these results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption no assurance can be given that the actual levels of the key inputs will not exceed perhaps significantly the ranges assumed by aig for purposes of the above analysis no assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these key inputs can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above corporate debt the following table represents the relevant market credit indices and index cds maturity used to estimate the sensitivity for the credit default swap portfolio written on investment grade corporate debt and the estimated increase decrease to the fair value of the derivative liability at september 30 2008 corresponding to changes in these market credit indices and maturity data table removed these results are calculated by stressing a particular assumption independently of changes in any other assumption no assurance can be given that the actual levels of the indices and maturity will not exceed perhaps significantly the ranges assumed by aigfp for purposes of the above 123 american international group inc and subsidiaries analysis no assumption should be made that results calculated from the use of other changes in these indices and maturity can be interpolated or extrapolated from the results set forth above stress testing of potential realized credit losses multi sector cdos in addition to performing sensitivity analyses around the valuation of the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio aig performed a roll rate analysis to stress the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio for potential pre tax realized credit losses without taking into consideration either sales of securities or early terminations of the contracts credit losses represent the shortfall of principal and or interest cash flows on the referenced super senior risk layers underlying the portfolio two scenarios illustrated in this process resulted in potential pre tax realized credit losses of approximately 7 8 billion scenario a and approximately 12 0 billion scenario b comparable amounts at june 30 2008 were 5 0 billion and 8 5 billion respectively at september 30 2008 aig used the same set of roll rate and loss severity assumptions in its roll rate analysis as those used at june 30 2008 however the estimated potential credit losses illustrated by scenarios a and b increased significantly over the amounts reported at june 30 2008 the increases in the estimated potential credit losses were principally attributable to three factors approximately 1 5 billion in each scenario was attributable to the increase in the libor interest rate caused by tight money market conditions which increased the modeled amounts of cash flow diversion to lower rated tranches within the multi sector cdos approximately 600 million in scenario a and 700 million in scenario b were attributable to enhancements used in the analysis to reflect more accurately the attributes of the portfolio and approximately 600 million in scenario a and 1 2 billion in scenario b were due to larger actual delinquencies in the performing mortgage pools and greater credit deterioration in other collateral securities other factors such as applying the pool losses determined based on the above factors up through the capital structures of the rmbs as well as the cash flow waterfall effects within the cdos account for the remainder of the increase the significant assumptions for subprime mortgages used in scenario a are provided below scenario b illustrates the effect of a 20 percent relative increase but not in excess of 100 percent in all scenario a roll rate default frequency assumptions and in all scenario a loss severity assumptions across all mortgage collateral for example 60 percent increased to 72 percent actual ultimate realized credit losses are likely to vary perhaps materially from these scenarios and there can be no assurance that the ultimate realized credit losses related to the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with either scenario or that such realized credit losses will not exceed the potential realized credit losses illustrated by scenario b in the second quarter of 2008 aig stressed the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio using the roll rate analysis enhanced to apply to all rmbs collateral including subprime alt a and prime residential mortgages that comprise the subprime alt a and prime rmbs this analysis assumed that certain percentages of actual delinquent mortgages will roll into default and foreclosure it also assumed that certain percentages of non delinquent mortgages will become delinquent and default over time with those delinquency percentages depending on the age of the mortgage pool to those assumed defaults aig applied loss severities one minus recovery to derive estimated ultimate losses for each mortgage pool comprising a subprime alt a and prime rmbs because subprime alt a and prime rmbs have differing characteristics the roll rates and loss severities differed aig then estimated tranche losses from these roll rate losses by applying the pool losses up through the capital structure of the rmbs in this estimate of tranche losses aig introduced in the second quarter of 2008 an enhancement to the roll rate analysis to take into account the cash flow waterfall and to capture the potential effects both positive and negative of cash flow diversion within each cdo to these estimated subprime alt a and prime rmbs losses aig added estimated credit losses on the inner cdos and other abs such as cmbs credit card and auto loan abs held by the cdos calculated by using rating based static percentages in the case of inner cdos varying by vintage and type of cdo and in the case of other abs by rating in addition to the foregoing the analysis incorporates the effects of certain other factors such as mortgage prepayment rates excess spread and delinquency triggers subprime rmbs comprise the majority of collateral securities within the multi sector cdos given adverse real estate market conditions subprime mortgage losses comprise the largest percentage of aigs pre tax credit impairment losses in scenarios a and b the roll rate analysis as mentioned above consists of projecting credit losses by projecting mortgage defaults and applying loss severities to these defaults mortgage defaults are estimated by applying roll rate frequencies to each segment of existing delinquent mortgages and by using loss timing curves to forecast future defaults from currently performing mortgages 124 american international group inc and subsidiaries the roll rate default frequency assumptions for subprime mortgages by vintage used in the scenario a roll rate analysis are as follows data table removed the subprime mortgage loss severity assumptions by vintage used in the scenario a roll rate analysis are as follows data table removed prior to june 30 2008 aig conducted risk analyses of the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio using certain ratings based static stress tests which centered around scenarios of further stress on the portfolio resulting from downgrades by the rating agencies from current levels on the underlying collateral in the cdo structures supported by aigfps credit default swaps during the first quarter of 2008 aig developed and implemented its roll rate analysis commencing in the second quarter of 2008 aig discontinued use of the rating based static stress test and used only the roll rate stress test because it believed that the roll rate stress test provided a more reasonable methodology to illustrate potential realized credit losses than the rating based static stress test used previously due to the dislocation in the market for cdo and rmbs collateral aig does not use the market values of the underlying cdo collateral in estimating its potential realized credit losses the use of factors derived from market observable prices in models used to determine the estimates for future realized credit losses could result in materially higher estimates of potential realized credit losses under the terms of most of these credit derivatives credit losses to aig would generally result from the credit impairment of the referenced obligations that aig would acquire in extinguishing its swap obligations other types of analyses or models could result in materially different estimates aig is aware that other market participants have used different assumptions and methodologies to estimate the potential realized credit losses on aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio resulting in significantly higher estimates than those resulting from aigs roll rate stress testing scenarios actual ultimate realized credit losses are likely to vary perhaps materially from aigs roll rate stress testing scenarios and there can be no assurance that the ultimate realized credit losses related to the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio will be consistent with either scenario or that such realized credit losses will not exceed the potential realized credit losses illustrated by scenario b the potential realized credit losses illustrated in scenarios a and b are lower than the 30 2 billion fair value derivative liability of aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio at september 30 2008 the fair value of aigfps super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio is based upon fair value accounting principles which rely on third party prices for both the underlying collateral securities and the cdos that aigfps super senior credit default swaps wrap these prices currently incorporate liquidity premiums risk aversion elements and credit risk modeling which in some instances may use more conservative assumptions than those used by aig in its roll rate stress testing due to the ongoing disruption in the u s residential mortgage market and credit markets and the downgrades of rmbs and cdos by the rating agencies the market continues to lack transparency around the pricing of these securities these prices are not necessarily reflective of the ultimate potential realized credit losses aigfp could incur in the future related to the aigfp super senior multi sector cdo credit default swap portfolio and aig believes they incorporate a significant amount of market driven risk aversion other derivatives valuation models that incorporate unobservable inputs initially are calibrated to the transaction price subsequent valuations are based on observable inputs to the valuation model e g interest rates credit spreads volatilities etc model inputs are changed only when corroborated by market data transfers into level 3 during the three months ended september 30 2008 aig transferred from level 2 to level 3 approximately 7 1 billion of assets primarily representing fixed maturity securities for which the significant inputs used to measure the fair value of the securities became unobservable primarily as a result of the significant disruption in the credit markets see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about transfers into level 3 valuation controls aig is actively implementing its remediation plan to address the material weakness in internal control relating to the fair value valuation of the aigfp super senior credit default swap portfolio and oversight thereof as described in item 9a of the 2007 annual report on form 10 k aig is developing new systems and processes to reduce reliance on certain manual controls that have been established as compensating controls over valuation of this portfolio and in other areas and is strengthening the resources required to remediate this weakness notwithstanding this need to continue strengthening these controls aig has an oversight structure that includes appropriate segregation of duties with respect to the valuation of its financial instruments senior management independent of the trading and investing functions is responsible for the 125 american international group inc and subsidiaries oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting the results of these controls and policies to aigs audit committee aig employs procedures for the approval of new transaction types and markets price verification periodic review of profit and loss and review of valuation models by personnel with appropriate technical knowledge of relevant products and markets these procedures are performed by personnel independent of the trading and investing functions for valuations that require inputs with little or no market observability aig compares the results of its valuation models to actual subsequent transactions capital resources and liquidity liquidity during the third quarter of 2008 aig experienced liquidity issues as described under current events related to liquidity as a result of these events aig ilfc and agf have not had access to their traditional sources of long term or short term financing through the public debt markets aig parents sources of liquidity currently consist of borrowings under the fed facility issuances of commercial paper under the cpff and borrowings under its other revolving credit facilities and dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries on november 10 2008 aig announced several transactions that will help stabilize aigs liquidity subject to the issuance of the series d preferred shares described below the fed credit agreement will be amended to among other things provide that the total commitment under the fed facility following the issuance of the series d preferred shares shall be 60 billion reduce the interest rate payable on outstanding borrowings under the fed facility from three month libor not less than 3 5 percent plus 8 5 percent per annum to three month libor not less than 3 5 percent plus 3 0 percent per annum reduce the fee payable on undrawn amounts from 8 5 percent per annum to 0 75 percent per annum reduce the number of shares of common stock of aig to be issued upon conversion of the series c preferred stock to be held by the trust to 77 9 percent and extend the term of the

common stock equal to 2 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock to the united states treasury the net proceeds of which will be used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the fed facility aig expects during the fourth quarter to form a limited liability company with the ny fed that will acquire rmbs owned by certain aig insurance company subsidiaries these proceeds together with other aig funds will be used to return all cash collateral posted by securities borrowers including approximately 19 9 billion to be returned to the ny fed after all collateral is returned aigs u s securities lending program will be terminated aig also expects during the fourth quarter to establish a limited liability company with the ny fed that will purchase up to approximately 70 billion of the cdo exposures protected by aigfps multi sector credit default swap portfolio these actions are expected to increase aigs effective borrowing capacity under the fed facility limit aigs exposure to the rmbs securities in the securities lending pool and limit aigs exposure to the cdos underlying its multi sector credit default swap portfolio at the subsidiary level

agreement in full upon the establishment of the limited liability company to repurchase the rmbs in the securities lending pool aig parent contributed 16 6 billion to domestic life insurance and retirement services companies during the first nine months of 2008 largely to offset the reduction in capital due to the significant other than temporary impairment charges to the extent the investment portfolios of the domestic life insurance and retirement services companies continue to be adversely affected by market conditions aig may need to make additional capital contributions to these companies foreign life insurance companies aigs foreign life insurance companies including alico have had significant capital needs following publicity of aig parents liquidity issues and related credit ratings downgrades and reflecting the decline in the equity markets aig contributed 1 6 billion to the foreign life insurance companies in september 2008 and 339 million in october 2008 to meet these needs aig expects to contribute approximately 1 4 billion to nan shan in november 2008 aig believes that its foreign life insurance subsidiaries will have adequate capital to support their business plans through the remainder of 2008 however to the extent the investment portfolios of the foreign life insurance companies continue to be adversely affected by market conditions aig may need to make additional capital contributions to these companies commercial insurance group aig expects cig to be able to continue to meet its obligations as they come due through cash from operations and to the extent necessary asset dispositions one or more large catastrophes however may require aig to provide additional support to cig aig has provided letters of credit that totaled 5 7 billion at october 27 2008 to allow subsidiaries of cig to obtain admitted surplus credit for reinsurance provided by non admitted carriers approximately 4 2 billion of these letters of credit will expire on december 31 2008 the inability of aig to renew or replace these letters of credit or otherwise obtain equivalent financial support would result in a significant reduction of the statutory surplus of these property and casualty companies and would require aig to make additional capital contributions international lease finance corporation to assure maximum liquidity for its operations

to support its operations and repay its obligations will be finance receivable collections from operations while limiting its lending activities and focusing on expense savings in addition agf is seeking secured financing agf anticipates that its existing sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its debt and other obligations through the first quarter of 2009 at that time aig will need to find other sources of liquidity for agf including sales of agf assets and funding through the fed facility aigcfg as a result of aig parents liquidity issues and related credit ratings downgrades aigcfg experienced significant deposit withdrawals in hong kong during september 2008 aigcfg subsidiaries borrowed 1 6 billion from aig in september and october of 2008 to meet these withdrawals and

investment strategy aigs investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit the investment objectives are driven by the business model for each of the businesses general insurance life insurance retirement services and asset managements spread based investment business the primary objectives are liquidity preservation of capital growth of surplus and generation of investment income to support the insurance products difficult market conditions in recent quarters have significantly hindered aigs ability to achieve these objectives and these challenges are expected to persist for the foreseeable future at the local operating unit level investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local market liability duration and cash flow characteristics rating agency and regulatory capital considerations legal investment limitations tax optimization and diversification the majority of assets backing insurance liabilities at aig consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities in the case of life insurance and retirement services companies as well as in the gic and mip portfolios of the asset management segment the fundamental investment strategy is as nearly as is practicable to match the duration characteristics of the liabilities with comparable duration assets fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in the aig property casualty group historically have consisted primarily of laddered holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds which provided attractive after tax returns and limited credit risk in light of aigs net operating position aig changed its intent to hold to maturity certain tax exempt municipal securities held by its insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities held by foreign general insurance companies consist primarily of intermediate duration high grade securities the market price of fixed maturity securities reflects numerous components including interest rate environment credit spread embedded optionality such as call features liquidity structural complexity foreign exchange risk and 138 american international group inc and subsidiaries other credit and non credit factors however in most circumstances pricing is most sensitive to interest rates such that the market price declines as interest rates rise and increases as interest rates fall this effect is more pronounced for longer duration securities aig marks to market the vast majority of the invested assets held by its insurance companies pursuant to fas 115 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and related accounting pronouncements however with limited exceptions primarily with respect to separate account products consolidated on aigs balance sheet pursuant to sop 03 01 aig does not mark to market its insurance liabilities for changes in interest rates even though rising interest rates have the effect of reducing the fair value of such liabilities and falling interest rates have the opposite effect this results in the recording of changes in unrealized gains losses on securities in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from changes in interest rates without any correlative inverse changes in gains losses on aigs liabilities because aigs asset duration in certain low yield currencies particularly japan and taiwan is shorter than its liability duration aig views increasing interest rates in these countries as economically advantageous notwithstanding the effect that higher rates have on the market value of its fixed maturity portfolio the majority of aigs non floating rate fixed maturity portfolio is held to support intermediate and long duration liabilities assuming no other changes in

invested in fixed maturity securities to earn a net spread historically aig had received cash collateral from borrowers between 100 102 percent of the value of the loaned securities the amount of cash advanced by borrowers has been declining in light of the availability of alternative transactions requiring less collateral if amounts received are insufficient to fund substantially all of the cost

fed facility to provide liquidity to the securities lending program as the funding from the fed facility and other available cash was used to satisfy liabilities to borrowers rather than sales of securities lending invested collateral the liabilities declined more significantly than the invested collateral the recognition of other than temporary impairment charges for the securities lending collateral investments placed significant stress on the statutory surplus of the participating insurance companies during the third quarter of 2008 aig recognized other than temporary impairment

the decision to sell any such fixed maturity security classified as available for sale reflects the judgment of aigs management that the security sold is unlikely to provide on a relative value basis as attractive a return in the future as alternative securities entailing comparable risks with respect to distressed securities the sale decision reflects managements judgment that the risk discounted anticipated ultimate recovery is less than the value achievable on sale aig evaluates its investments for impairments in valuation as well as credit the determination that a security has incurred an other than temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer its near term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances see critical accounting estimates other than temporary impairments herein for further information on aigs policy once a security has been identified as other than temporarily impaired

approximately four percent of the fixed maturity securities had issuer credit ratings that were below investment grade 148 american international group inc and subsidiaries aig did not consider these securities in an unrealized loss position to be other than temporarily impaired at september 30 2008 because management has the intent and ability to hold these investments until they recover their cost basis within a recovery period deemed temporary aig believes the securities will generally continue to perform in accordance with the original terms notwithstanding the present price declines for the three and nine month periods ended september 30 2008 unrealized losses related to investment grade bonds increased 3 0 billion 2 0 billion after tax and 13 5 billion 8 8 billion after tax

purposes of asset liability and liquidity management processes aig is responding to these developments by enhancing its risk management processes and stress testing the continuation of such market turmoil and associated price declines and limited liquidity have severely constrained aigs alternatives for mitigating its exposure to credit market and liquidity risks aig has continued to invest in

of aigs business exposes it to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses across multiple lines of business can occur in any calendar year to control this exposure aig uses a combination of techniques including setting aggregate limits in key business units monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement its other reinsurance protections natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect aigs operating results other risks such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease such as the avian influenza a virus h5n1 could adversely affect aigs business and operating results to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance programs aig evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude of catastrophic events through the use of industry recognized models among other techniques aig updates these models by periodically monitoring the exposure risks of aigs worldwide general insurance operations following is an overview of modeled losses associated with the more significant natural perils which includes exposures for aig property casualty group and foreign general other than ascot transatlantic and ascot utilize a different model and their results are presented separately below significant life insurance and accident and health exposures have been added to these results as well the modeled results assume that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to aig in accordance with their terms it is important to recognize that there is no standard methodology to project the possible losses from total property and workers compensation exposures further there are no industry standard assumptions to be utilized in projecting these losses the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses therefore these modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not reflect aigs maximum exposures to these events it is highly likely that aigs losses will vary perhaps significantly from these estimates aig has revised the catastrophe exposure disclosures presented below from that presented in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k to reflect more recent data for aigs property casualty group as well as reinsurance programs in place as of september 1 2008 the modeled results provided in the table below were based on the aggregate exceedence probability aep losses which represent total property workers compensation life and accident and health losses that may occur in any single year from one or more natural events the updated property casualty group property exposures were modeled with exposure data as of june 2008 the values provided were based on 100 year return period losses which have a one percent likelihood of being exceeded in any single year thus the model projects that there is a one percent probability that aig could incur in any year losses in excess of the modeled amounts for these perils losses include loss adjustment expenses and the net values include reinstatement premiums 152 american international group inc and subsidiaries data table removed includes hurricanes typhoons and european windstorms both gross earthquake and tropical cyclone modeled losses increased 1 0 billion compared to estimates included in the 2007 annual report on form 10 k while net after tax losses increased 456 million and 431 million respectively these increases are mainly attributable to growth in lexington private client group and energy in addition to the return period loss aig evaluates potential single event earthquake and hurricane losses that may be incurred the single events utilized are a subset of potential events identified and utilized by lloyds see lloyds realistic disaster scenarios scenario specifications april 2006 and referred to as realistic disaster scenarios rdss the purpose of this analysis is to utilize these rdss to provide a reference frame and place into context the model results however it is important to note that the specific events used for this analysis do not necessarily represent the worst case loss that aig could incur from this type of an event in these regions the losses associated with the rdss are included in the following table single event modeled property and workers compensation losses to aigs worldwide portfolio of risk for key geographic areas are set forth below gross values represent aigs liability after the application of policy limits and deductibles and net values represent losses after reinsurance is applied net losses also include reinsurance reinstatement premiums both gross
