ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS THE FOLLOWING SUPPLEMENTS THE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT AIGS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS DESCRIBED UNDER RISK FACTORS IN ITEM 1A OF PART I OF AIGS 2008 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10 K EMPLOYEES A LOSS OF KEY AIGFP EMPLOYEES COULD PREVENT AN ORDERLY WIND DOWN OF AIGFPS BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS LEAD TO POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT AIGS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN LIGHT OF AMONG OTHER THINGS THE NEGATIVE PUBLICITY SURROUNDING THE RETENTION PAYMENTS TO AIGFP EMPLOYEES A NUMBER OF KEY EMPLOYEES HAVE LEFT AIGFP WHILE AIGFP CONTINUES TO WIND DOWN ITS BUSINESS IN AN ORDERLY MANNER THE LOSS OF ADDITIONAL KEY EMPLOYEES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT AIGS ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY WIND DOWN AIGFP AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT AIGS INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING ALTHOUGH AIG VIEWS THE LARGE MARKET RISK BOOKS AT AIGFP AS GENERALLY WELL HEDGED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CREDIT RISK MAINTAINING THE HEDGES REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MONITORING AND ADJUSTMENT IF AIGFP LOSES THE KEY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH AND KNOW HOW TO HEDGE THESE POSITIONS GAPS IN HEDGING COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES TO AIGFP AIG RELIES UPON THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF THE AIGFP EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS FOR THE EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY PREPARATION OF REQUIRED FILINGS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OPERATION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS IN ADDITION AIGFPS PORTFOLIOS CONTAIN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND MANAGE IT WOULD NOT BE PRACTICAL TO REPLACE ALL THE KEY AIGFP TRADERS AND RISK MANAGERS WHO OVERSEE THESE COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS IF THESE EMPLOYEES WERE TO LEAVE AIGFP PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THESE TRADES AND THE UNIQUE SYSTEMS AT AIGFP IS CRITICAL TO AN EFFECTIVE WIND DOWN OF AIGFPS BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS FURTHERMORE IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ANY PERCEIVED DISRUPTION IN AIGFPS ABILITY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS SUCH AS ONE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE DEPARTURE OF THESE KEY EMPLOYEES COULD CAUSE PARTIES TO LIMIT OR CEASE TRADING WITH AIGFP WHICH WOULD FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECT AIGFPS ABILITY TO COST EFFECTIVELY HEDGE ITS POSITIONS AND ITS EFFORT TO WIND DOWN ITS BUSINESSES AND PORTFOLIOS EMPLOYEE DEPARTURES MAY ALSO HAVE REGULATORY RAMIFICATIONS FOR AIGFP AS AN EXAMPLE THE RECENT RESIGNATIONS ONE OF WHICH WAS RESCINDED OF TWO SENIOR MANAGERS OF AIGFPS BANQUE AIG S A BANQUE AIG SUBSIDIARY WOULD HAVE PERMITTED THE COMMISSION BANCAIRE THE FRENCH BANKING REGULATOR TO APPOINT ITS OWN DESIGNEE TO STEP IN AND MANAGE BANQUE AIG IF AIG HAD BEEN UNABLE TO RETAIN OR REPLACE THESE KEY EMPLOYEES TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE COMMISSION BANCAIRE SUCH AN APPOINTMENT BY THE COMMISSION BANCAIRE WOULD CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER BANQUE AIGS DERIVATIVE AND STRUCTURED TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING THE REGULATORY CAPITAL CDS PORTFOLIO AND POTENTIALLY ENTAIL VERY SUBSTANTIAL UNWIND COSTS THE AMOUNT OF WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE SEPARATION AND RESTRUCTURING PLAN THE COMPLEXITY OF EXECUTING AIGS DISPOSITION PLAN COMBINED WITH THE CHALLENGES OF OPERATING AIGS BUSINESS IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT COULD PLACE FURTHER STRESS ON AIGS INTERNAL CONTROLS INCREASE AIGS COSTS AND DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF AIG MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES FROM THEIR NORMAL DUTIES THE EXECUTION OF AIGS RESTRUCTURING PLAN IS INTRODUCING A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLEX AND NON STANDARD TRANSACTIONS WHICH ARE PLACING A STRAIN ON EXISTING RESOURCES SYSTEMS AND COMMUNICATION CHANNELS FURTHERMORE AIGS EMPLOYEES ARE OPERATING IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE FREQUENCY AND UNCERTAINTY OF DEVELOPMENTS COULD DECREASE THE ATTENTION DEVOTED TO TRANSACTIONS AND CRITICAL MANAGEMENT REVIEW CONTROLS ALTHOUGH AIG IS TAKING STEPS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF THIRD PARTY CONSULTANTS AND ADVANCE PLANNING IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE RISKS COULD PREVENT AIG FROM MAKING REQUIRED FILINGS PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT AIGS INTERNAL CONTROLS ALSO INCREASED COSTS WILL RESULT FROM THE CREATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THIS NEW OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE 165 AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC AND SUBSIDIARIES REPUTATIONAL HARM ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND PUBLIC REACTION TO EVENTS CONCERNING AIG HAS HAD AND MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON AIG SINCE SEPTEMBER 2008 AIG HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INTENSE SCRUTINY AND EXTENSIVE COMMENT BY GLOBAL NEWS MEDIA OFFICIALS OF GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD AND SEGMENTS OF THE PUBLIC AT LARGE IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT AIG SERVES AT TIMES THERE HAS BEEN STRONG CRITICISM OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY AIG ITS MANAGEMENT AND ITS EMPLOYEES AND OF TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AIG HAS ENGAGED IN A FEW INSTANCES SUCH AS THE PUBLIC REACTION IN MARCH 2009 OVER THE PAYMENT OF RETENTION AWARDS TO AIGFP EMPLOYEES THIS CRITICISM HAS INCLUDED HARASSMENT OF INDIVIDUAL AIG EMPLOYEES OR PUBLIC PROTEST AFFECTING AIG FACILITIES TO DATE THIS SCRUTINY AND EXTENSIVE COMMENTARY HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED AIG BY DAMAGING AIGS BUSINESS REPUTATION AND BRAND AMONG CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AGENTS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTORS OF AIG PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEREBY REDUCING SALES OF AIG PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN AIG POLICYHOLDER SURRENDERS AND NON RENEWALS OF AIG POLICIES THIS SCRUTINY AND COMMENTARY HAS ALSO UNDERMINED EMPLOYEE MORALE AND AIGS ABILITY TO MOTIVATE AND RETAIN ITS EMPLOYEES IF THIS LEVEL OF SCRUTINY AND CRITICISM CONTINUES OR INCREASES AIGS BUSINESS MAY BE FURTHER ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES FURTHER HARMED DEFERRED TAX ASSET THE RECOVERABILITY OF AIGS DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS WHICH MAY NOT OCCUR THE RECOVERABILITY OF THIS ASSET DEPENDS ON AIG
