OTHER MAJOR ECONOMIES ENTERED INTO A RECESSION IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT HOW LONG GLOBAL RECESSIONARY CONDITIONS WILL EXIST OR THE MANNER IN WHICH AIGS MARKETS PRODUCTS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESSES WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS RESULTED IN A LACK OF LIQUIDITY HIGHLY VOLATILE MARKETS A STEEP DEPRECIATION IN ASSET VALUES ACROSS ALL CLASSES AN EROSION OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE A WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS A LACK OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY IN MANY MARKETS AND THE COLLAPSE OR MERGER OF SEVERAL PROMINENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ALSO RESULTED IN INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT AND A SEVERE DECLINE IN BUSINESS ACTIVITY ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND REGIONS GLOBAL REGULATORS GOVERNMENTS AND CENTRAL BANKS HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF UNPRECEDENTED STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BUT THESE STEPS HAVE SO FAR FAILED TO PREVENT FINANCIAL MARKETS FROM DECLINING BY A VERY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT BOTH IN PERCENTAGE TERMS AND IN ABSOLUTE TERMS IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE MEASURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE OR IF EFFECTIVE WHEN MARKETS WILL STABILIZE AIG HAS BEEN MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE CONDITIONS AND EVENTS IN A
