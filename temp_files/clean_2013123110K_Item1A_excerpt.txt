AND HAVE CONTINUED OUR STRATEGY ADOPTED IN 2010 TO IMPROVE THE ALLOCATION OF OUR REINSURANCE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL REINSURANCE MARKETS AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS SUCH AS THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF CATASTROPHE BONDS TO MANAGE RISKS MORE EFFICIENTLY WHILE REINSURANCE DOES NOT DISCHARGE OUR SUBSIDIARIES FROM THEIR OBLIGATION TO PAY CLAIMS FOR LOSSES INSURED UNDER OUR POLICIES IT DOES MAKE THE REINSURER LIABLE TO THEM FOR THE REINSURED PORTION OF THE RISK FOR THIS REASON REINSURANCE IS AN IMPORTANT RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL TO MANAGE TRANSACTION AND INSURANCE LINE RISK RETENTION AND TO MITIGATE LOSSES FROM CATASTROPHES MARKET CONDITIONS BEYOND OUR CONTROL DETERMINE THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF REINSURANCE FOR EXAMPLE REINSURANCE MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY TO OBTAIN AFTER A YEAR WITH A
