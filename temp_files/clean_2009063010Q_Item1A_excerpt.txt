FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRINCIPALLY IN EUROPE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING REGULATORY CAPITAL RELIEF RATHER THAN FOR ARBITRAGE PURPOSES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE LIABILITY FOR THESE CDS TRANSACTIONS WAS 47 MILLION AT JUNE 30 2009 THE REGULATORY BENEFIT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR AIGFPS FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY DERIVED FROM THE TERMS OF THE CAPITAL ACCORD OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION BASEL I THAT EXISTED THROUGH THE END OF 2007 AND WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING REPLACED BY THE REVISED FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE OF CAPITAL MEASUREMENT AND CAPITAL STANDARDS ISSUED BY THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION BASEL II FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES ARE EXPECTED TO TRANSITION FROM BASEL I TO BASEL II OVER A TWO YEAR ADOPTION PERIOD THROUGH DECEMBER 31 2009 AFTER WHICH THEY WILL RECEIVE LITTLE OR NO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY BENEFIT FROM THESE CDS TRANSACTIONS EXCEPT IN A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIFIC INSTANCES AND THEREFORE AIGFP EXPECTS THAT THE COUNTERPARTIES WILL TERMINATE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE NEXT 9 MONTHS THE PACE AT WHICH THESE CDS TRANSACTIONS WILL BE TERMINATED FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION TO BASEL II IS AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED OR OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO AIGFP REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE AND CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS IN EACH REGULATORY CAPITAL CDS TRANSACTION IS NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL TRANSACTIONS FURTHERMORE IN A MAJORITY OF CORPORATE LOAN TRANSACTIONS AND ALL OF THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE TRANSACTIONS THE POOLS ARE BLIND MEANING THAT THE IDENTITIES OF OBLIGORS ARE NOT DISCLOSED TO AIGFP IN ADDITION ALTHOUGH AIGFP RECEIVES PERIODIC REPORTS ON THE UNDERLYING ASSET POOLS VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE REGULATORY CAPITAL CDS TRANSACTIONS CONTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RESTRICTIONS THAT PRECLUDE AIGFPS PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATING TO THE UNDERLYING REFERENCED ASSETS AIGFP ANALYZES THE INFORMATION REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE AND CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING POOLS OF ASSETS REQUIRED TO MAKE ITS OWN RISK ASSESSMENT AND TO DETERMINE ANY CHANGES IN CREDIT QUALITY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH POOLS OF ASSETS WHILE MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION RECEIVED BY AIGFP CANNOT BE AGGREGATED IN A COMPARABLE WAY FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES BECAUSE OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY RESTRICTIONS AND THE INCONSISTENCY OF THE INFORMATION IT DOES PROVIDE A SUFFICIENT BASIS FOR AIGFP TO EVALUATE THE RISKS OF THE PORTFOLIO AND TO DETERMINE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE GIVEN THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIOS THE LEVEL OF SUBORDINATION AND AIGFPS OWN ASSESSMENT OF THE CREDIT QUALITY AS WELL AS THE RISK MITIGANTS INHERENT IN THE TRANSACTION STRUCTURES AIGFP DOES NOT EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDING REGULATORY CAPITAL RELIEF FURTHER AIGFP EXPECTS THAT COUNTERPARTIES WILL TERMINATE THESE TRANSACTIONS PRIOR TO THEIR MATURITY AIGFP WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE VALUATION OF THIS PORTFOLIO AND MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MARKETPLACE GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT MARKETS THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT AIG WILL NOT RECOGNIZE UNREALIZED MARKET VALUATION LOSSES FROM THIS PORTFOLIO IN FUTURE PERIODS AIG COULD
